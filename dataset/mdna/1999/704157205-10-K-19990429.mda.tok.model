item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s store growth through january  was funded primarily through a series of debt offerings and convertible preferred stock offerings 
with the net proceeds from such offerings  the company added seven  ten and two stores during the fiscal years ended january   january  and january   respectively 
during fiscal  management devoted substantially all its resources to restructuring the balance sheet and capital structure and completing the initial public offering of its common stock 
see item business general 
the completion of the initial public offering in march resulted in a significant financial restructuring of the capital structure which dramatically improved the company s consolidated balance sheet and its interest and dividend requirements 
since the company s inception in january  profitability has been significantly impacted by two factors interest expense associated with outstanding indebtedness and development of the infrastructure necessary to support rapid growth 
the company converted or repaid substantially all outstanding indebtedness as a result of its initial public offering in march corporate administrative expenses have been impacted by costs incurred in the development of management and financial controls  development of the company s proprietary software system  and attracting an experienced management team capable of implementing a rapid roll out of pawnmart sm stores 
this growth strategy and the investment in management and financial controls substantially increased interest expense and corporate administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
during fiscal  the company added stores bringing the total to stores 
the company s results of operations and cash flows are significantly impacted by i expansion through development of new stores or acquisitions of existing stores in locations that meet site selection  store size and configuration requirements in selected markets and ii the maturation cycle of stores 
the company believes that material fluctuations in the results of operations from lending activities and product sales due to seasonality will not occur 
initial capital expenditures and costs associated with expansion the company s strategy is to develop or acquire pawnmart sm stores in selected regional and local markets meeting required store size  configuration  and site selection requirements 
the company believes that such anticipated expansion will continue to provide economies of scale in supervision  purchasing supplies and inventory  administration and marketing by decreasing the overall average cost of such functions per unit owned 
after a suitable market has been selected  management determines whether expansion through development of new stores or through acquisitions would result in the most favorable impact on profitability and capital requirements 
after a suitable location has been found and a lease and license are obtained  a new store can be ready for business within six to eight weeks  with completion of counters  vaults and security system and transfer of merchandise from existing stores  and external purchases of pre owned merchandise 
the company projects the initial capital expenditures and costs associated with opening a new pawnmart sm store to total approximately  with additional capital expenditures during the months after opening of approximately  to fund loan growth and planned start up losses 
because of these start up losses and expenditures necessary to support anticipated growth  the company expects to incur losses during a high growth phase 
there can be no assurance that future initial capital expenditures and costs and start up losses with new store operations will not vary from historical amounts 
the company does not capitalize start up losses and does not recognize pawn service charges on defaulted loans 
the company will generally acquire stores in locations meeting its site selection criteria if i the total capital expenditures required to acquire the existing store are less than or equal to the total costs to develop a new store  ii the acquisition does not result in significant goodwill balances  and iii demographic data and due diligence procedures indicate an acceptable growth potential 
because acquired stores mature more quickly than new stores and generally result in lower initial capital expenditures  the company s profitability and capital requirements are impacted by the number of stores added through acquisition versus the number of new stores added 
maturation of newly established stores and acquired stores the revenues and profitability of a new store are primarily impacted by the company s ability to increase pawn loans during the first twelve months of operations 
a new store is generally unprofitable during its first six to eight months of operations due to the lack of pawn service charges associated with pawn loans during that period 
the company s new stores experience substantially higher levels of revenues and profitability after reaching two years of age 
at january   of the company s stores were under two years of age 
these stores are expected to have a favorable impact on profitability if they achieve the substantially increased lending and retail volumes experienced in the company s other stores 
an acquired store will generally mature faster than a new store due to an established base of customers and the company s ability to accelerate the maturation of the store s pawn loan balances 
the company s profitability during rapid expansion will be significantly impacted by its ability to acquire existing stores meeting the company s acquisition criteria 
there can be no assurance that future store revenues and store profitability will not vary from historical amounts 
selected elements of the company s consolidated financial statements are presented below for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal the following table  as well as the discussion following  should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and item consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto

on a fiscal comparable store basis  store operating expenses comprised of total revenues during fiscal compared to of total revenues during fiscal store contribution margin increased to  during fiscal compared to  during fiscal primarily due to significant improvements in the profitability of fiscal comparable stores which were offset by the effects of planned start up losses at stores added during fiscal excluding the effects of planned start up losses  the fiscal comparable store contribution margin increased to  during fiscal compared to  during fiscal the following table presents an analysis of fiscal comparable store and new store performance for fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal comparable new stores stores consolidated consolidated merchandise sales    pawn service charges    other total revenues    cost of sales    gross profit    store operating expenses    store contribution  corporate administrative expenses increased to  during fiscal from  during fiscal primarily due to i the issuance of  shares of unregistered common stock in exchange for  in non recurring professional fees associated with marketing and store site selection non recurring professional fees  ii increased labor costs associated with the hiring of manager trainees to support store openings  iii increased labor costs associated with the hiring of additional executive management to support planned growth  and iv increased professional fees associated with human resource development and regulatory matters 
since the company added stores during fiscal and plans to add additional stores during the fiscal year ending january   management anticipates corporate administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues 
interest expense decreased to  during fiscal from  during fiscal fiscal includes  in non cash non recurring interest expense resulting from the accounting treatment relating to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the company s convertible subordinated debentures non cash non recurring interest expense and  in interest expense related to debt that was either converted or repaid upon completion of the company s initial public offering non recurring interest expense

gross profit as a percentage of total revenues declined from during fiscal to during fiscal primarily due to a conscious effort to sell older inventory  an uninsured theft at one of the company s stores during february and allowances provided for shrinkage and valuation based on management s evaluation of inventories on hand 
the company s annualized inventory turnover rate was times during fiscal compared to times during fiscal primarily due to increased store traffic and a conscious effort to sell older inventory 
store operating expenses increased to  during fiscal from  during fiscal primarily due to increased labor at fiscal comparable stores to support increased store activity and the addition of two stores during fiscal operating expenses as a percent of total revenues decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal primarily resulting from significant increases in fiscal comparable store merchandise sales and pawn service charges discussed above 
store contribution margin increased to  during fiscal compared to  during fiscal primarily due to increases in fiscal comparable store merchandise sales and pawn service charges which were not offset by corresponding increases in store operating expenses 
interest expense increased to  during fiscal from  during fiscal primarily due to  in additional non cash interest expense recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from the accounting treatment relating to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the company s convertible subordinated debentures and increases in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended january  included under item consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting treatment relating to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the company s convertible subordinated debentures 
corporate administrative expenses increased to  during fiscal from  during fiscal primarily due to i increased salaries associated with the hiring of additional executive management  ii increased expenses associated with development of marketing programs  iii increased expenses associated with the company s comprehensive insurance package  iv and increased professional fees associated with human resource development  the preparation of the company s franchise offering circular and fees associated with the preparation of tax returns 
however  administrative expenses decreased to of total revenues during fiscal compared to during fiscal primarily resulting from significant increases in comparable store merchandise sales and pawn service charges discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the completion of its initial public offering in march  the company s operations were financed from funds generated from private debt and equity offerings and funds generated from operations 
in march  the company received net proceeds of approximately  from the completion of its initial public offering 
see item business general 
in connection with the completion of the initial public offering   in aggregate principal amount of the company s convertible subordinated debentures were automatically converted into  outstanding shares of common stock and all classes of the company s preferred stock were automatically converted into an aggregate of  outstanding shares of common stock 
additionally  the company utilized  of the net proceeds to repay certain notes payable 
on october   the company entered into a million revolving credit facility with comerica bank the credit facility 
at january    was outstanding under the credit facility and an additional  was available to the company pursuant to the available borrowing base 
the credit facility bears interest at either i the prevailing prime rate plus  which was at january   or ii the prevailing libor rate plus  and matures on october  amounts available under the credit facility are limited to certain percentages of pawn loans  inventories  and pawn service charges receivable 
the credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the unencumbered assets of the company 
under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain technical covenants 
the company was in compliance with these requirements and covenants as of january  the company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of of on the average daily unused portion of the credit facility commitment 
the company is prohibited from paying cash dividends or acquiring treasury stock under the terms of the credit facility 
at january   the company s primary sources of liquidity were  in cash and cash equivalents   in pawn service charges receivable   in pawn loans outstanding   in inventories  and  of available and unused funds under the company s credit facility 
the company had a current ratio of approximately to and to at january  and january   respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was  during fiscal and  during fiscal the company s profitability and liquidity is affected by the amount of loans outstanding  which is controlled in part by the company s loaning decisions 
the company is able to influence the frequency of forfeiture of collateral by increasing or decreasing the amount loaned in relation to the sales value of the pledged property 
tighter credit decisions generally result in smaller loans in relation to the estimated sales value of the pledged property and can thereby decrease the company s aggregate loan balance and  consequently  decrease pawn service charges 
additionally  lower loans in relation to the pledged property s estimated sales value tend to slightly increase loan redemptions and improve the company s liquidity 
conversely  providing higher loans in relation to the estimated sales value of the pledged property can result in an increase in the company s pawn service charge income 
higher average loan balances can also result in a slight increase in loan forfeitures  which increases the quantity of goods on hand and  unless the company increases inventory turnover  reduces the company s liquidity 
in addition to these factors  liquidity is also affected by merchandise sales and the pace of store expansion 
the addition of michael d 
record as president in september resulted in a renewed focus on the company s lending operations 
during fiscal  pawn loans increased  or due to a  or increase in fiscal comparable store pawn loans and a  increase in pawn loans at stores opened during fiscal the company expects pawn loan balances to continue to increase during the fiscal year ending january  and plans to fund such growth with cash flows from operations  borrowings under the credit facility  and capital provided by a public debt offering of the notes as defined below 
on march   the company commenced a public offering of up to million in principal amount of subordinated notes due december  the notes 
the notes are being offered on a best efforts basis by participating nasd broker dealers with a minimum subscription of  interest on the notes is payable monthly commencing with the second full calendar month following issuance 
at the option of the company  the notes may be redeemed prior to december  at stipulated redemption prices 
as of april    of the notes had been issued 
the company believes its planned roll out of pawnmart sm stores will be funded by borrowings under the credit facility  cash flows generated from its established stores  net proceeds from the offering of the notes  and future debt or equity offerings 
in addition to factors noted under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that could affect future performance  the company s store expansion during the fiscal year ending january  will largely be dependent upon the amount of notes sold 
in the event the company is unable to sell the maximum subscription or additional financing alternatives are not obtained  its fiscal expansion schedule could be reduced or modified 
no assurance can be made that the company will be able to sell the maximum subscription of notes or obtain additional financing 
recent accounting pronouncements the following selected accounting pronouncements were issued during fiscal  but have not yet become effective  and are listed with the expected impact on the company 
fasb  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  since the company does not use derivative instruments  the effect of the implementation of this new pronouncement is not expected to have any effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities this statement of position requires that the costs of start up activities  including organizational costs  be expensed as incurred 
sop  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires the initial application to be recorded as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the sop is first adopted and reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the implementation of this new pronouncement is not expected to have a significant effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
year compliance the year problem concerns the inability of information systems to properly recognize date sensitive information beyond december  the company has begun a project to bring software and systems into year compliance in time to minimize any significant or detrimental effects on its operations 
the project covers information systems  operating systems  other non financial systems equipment and significant third party vendors 
the company has adopted a five level process toward year compliance awareness  assessment identification of where failures may occur  solutions  workarounds  and plans to repair or replace  renovation repair  replace or retire systems that cannot properly process year dates  validation  and implementation 
at january   the first three levels have been substantially completed  except for third parties as discussed below 
the company expects to complete the remaining levels by june the company is applying the five level process to both its information technology it systems and non it systems 
computer equipment and software commonly thought of as it systems include point of sale  accounting  data processing  telephone and other miscellaneous systems 
non it systems include alarm systems  security observation equipment  hvac units  fax machines  and other miscellaneous systems 
the company believes that it has identified the internal business systems that are susceptible to system failures or processing errors as a result of the year problem 
the company s proprietary operating software system represents its only critical internal business system 
the proprietary operating software system has been upgraded for year compliance and is being tested 
the vendors which supply the company s accounting applications  payroll  and other financial software systems have represented that their products are year compliant 
the company has upgraded substantially all of its hardware to mitigate year problems from affecting its operations and anticipates incurring approximately  during the fiscal year ending january  to bring existing hardware into compliance 
the company is reviewing the critical third parties which provide services or goods which are essential to its operations in order to determine the extent to which the company is subject to any failure by such third parties to adequately address and resolve their respective year problems 
these third parties include financial institutions  utility suppliers  and providers of communication services and equipment 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain satisfactory assurance that a critical third party provider has achieved year compliance  and the company is unable to replace the provider with an alternative provider  its operations could be adversely impacted 
based on the current status of the five level year process  the company does not foresee significant risks associated with the year problem 
however  management believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems have been identified or will be corrected 
with this in mind  management is developing contingency plans for implementation in the event a significant third party vendor does not adequately address the year problem or unexpected problems occur in the company s operations 
these plans primarily involve using backup sites  alternative vendors or internal remediation 
in the event of a year problem  the company could likely suffer a number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for both the company and its customers that could divert management s time and attention and financial and human resources from its ordinary business activities 
factors that could affect future performance lack of profitability  expected losses during roll out phase from its inception on january  through january   the company has experienced aggregate losses of  further  a key element of the company s strategy consists of developing multiple pawnmart sm stores meeting the company s required store size  configuration  and site selection requirements in regional and local markets 
this strategy is likely to result in continued net losses during the company s roll out phase due to start up losses associated with the anticipated high number of new stores 
results of operations in the future will be influenced by numerous factors including  among others  the number of new store expansions  the company s ability to manage its growth and maintain the quality of its personnel  and the ability of the company to implement its strategic plan 
substantial leverage  ability to service debt at january   the company had total long term indebtedness of  in addition  the company is currently offering up to million of notes on a best efforts basis 
at april   the company had  of notes outstanding 
the degree to which the company is leveraged could have adverse consequences to holders of the debt  including the following i substantial cash flow from the company s operations will be required for the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future  whether for capital expenditures  further development  refinancings or otherwise  may be impaired  iii the company may be more leveraged than certain of its competitors  which may place it at a competitive disadvantage  and iv the company s high degree of leverage makes it more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions and may limit the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures and capitalize on significant business opportunities 
the company expects to repay its indebtedness with either i cash flows from operations  ii proceeds from the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  iii refinancing  iv proceeds from the exercise of the series a warrants  or v the sale of certain assets 
the company will require substantial cash flows to meet its interest payment obligations with respect to its indebtedness 
the company s cash flow is dependent on its future performance and is subject to financial  economic and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
since the credit facility bears interest at a floating rate  the company is sensitive to any increase in prevailing interest rates 
the company believes that  based upon anticipated levels of operations  it should be able to meet its debt service obligations when due 
if the company is unable to generate such cash flow from operations to satisfy its interest obligations  the company may be required to refinance all or a portion of such obligations  sell assets  or repay such indebtedness with proceeds from other capital transactions  such as the issuance of additional equity 
there can be no assurance that such refinancing or extension will be available on reasonable terms or at all  that additional equity will be issued  or that a sale of assets will occur 
the inability to repay such indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on the company 
inability to sell maximum subscription of notes although the company is offering up to million in notes on a best efforts basis  there are no assurances that the maximum offering amount will be subscribed 
the company s store expansion during the fiscal year ending january  will largely be dependent upon the number of notes sold 
in the event the company is unable to sell the maximum subscription or additional financing alternatives are not obtained  the company s fiscal expansion schedule could be reduced or modified 
liquidity although the company has entered into the million credit facility  there are no assurances that the company s cash and cash equivalents on hand and its cash availability will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated working capital needs and capital expenditures in the future 
to finance future expenditures  the company may need to issue additional securities or incur additional debt 
the company may not be able to obtain additional required capital on satisfactory terms  if at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance future cash requirements could materially and adversely affect the company s operating results and anticipated growth in future periods 
management of growth the company plans to expand its business through a roll out of pawnmart sm stores 
to a significant extent  the company s future success will be dependent upon its ability to engage in a successful expansion program and will be dependent  in part  upon its ability to secure suitable sites for its new stores  obtain adequate inventory for its new stores  maintain adequate financial controls and reporting systems to manage a larger operation  and to obtain additional capital upon favorable terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement its planned expansion  finance its growth or manage the resulting larger operation 
availability of qualified store management personnel the company s ability to expand may also be limited by the availability of qualified store management personnel 
while the company seeks to train existing qualified personnel for management positions and to create attractive compensation packages to retain existing management personnel  there can be no assurance that sufficient qualified personnel will be available to satisfy the company s needs with respect to its planned expansion 
competition the company encounters significant competition in connection with the operation of its business 
in connection with lending operations  the company competes with other pawnshops owned by individuals and by large operators and certain financial institutions  such as consumer finance companies  which generally lend on an unsecured  as well as on a secured basis 
the company s competitors in connection with its retail sales include numerous retail and discount stores 
many of the company s competitors  including cash america international  inc  first cash financial services  inc  and ezcorp  inc  have greater financial resources 
these competitive conditions may adversely affect the company s revenues  profitability and ability to expand 
in addition  the company faces competition in the acquisition of existing stores 
several competing pawnshop companies have implemented expansion and acquisition programs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be more successful than its competitors in pursuing acquisition opportunities and leases for attractive start up locations 
increased competition could also increase prices for attractive acquisition candidates 
government regulation the company s lending operations are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and licensing under various federal  state and local statutes  ordinances and regulations 
these statutes prescribe  among other things  service charges a pawnshop may charge for lending money and the rules of conduct that govern an entity s ability to maintain a pawnshop license 
with respect to firearm and ammunition sales  a pawnshop must comply with the regulations promulgated by the united states department of the treasury bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms 
governmental regulators have broad discretionary authority to refuse to grant a license or to suspend or revoke any or all existing licenses of licensees under common control if it is determined that any such licensee has violated any law or regulation or that the management of any such licensee is not suitable to operate pawnshops 
in addition  there can be no assurance that additional state or federal statutes or regulations will not be enacted at some future date which could inhibit the company s ability to expand  significantly decrease the service charges the company can charge for lending money  or prohibit or more stringently regulate the sale of certain goods  such as firearms  any of which could significantly adversely affect the company s prospects 
the company s ability to open new stores in other states could be affected by the enactment of state or local legislation  similar to current texas legislation  which requires a finding of public need and probable profitability by the texas consumer credit commissioner as a condition to the issuance or activation of any new pawnshop license in texas counties having a population of more than  in addition  the present statutory and regulatory environment of some states renders expansion into those states impractical 
for instance  certain states require public sale of forfeited collateral or do not permit service charges sufficient to make pawnshop operations profitable 
risks related to improper assessment of the pledged property s estimated resale value the company makes pawn loans without the borrower s personal liability and does not investigate the creditworthiness of the borrower  but relies on the pledged personal property  and the possibility of its forfeiture  as a basis for its lending decision 
in this regard  the recovery of the amount advanced  as well as realization of a profit on sale of merchandise  is dependent on the company s initial assessment of the property s estimated resale value 
improper assessment of the resale value of the collateral in the lending function can result in reduced marketability of the property and resale of the merchandise for an amount less than the amount advanced 
although  historically  the company has experienced profits from the sale of such merchandise  no assurances can be given that the company s historical results will continue 
for example  unexpected technological changes could adversely impact the value of consumer electronic products and declines in gold and silver prices could reduce the resale value of jewelry items acquired in pawn transactions and could adversely affect the company s ability to recover the amount advanced on the acquired collateral 
dependence on key management the company relies on the business and technical expertise of its executive officers and certain other key employees  particularly its chief executive officer  carson thompson and its president  michael record 
except for an employment agreement with michael record  the company does not have an employment agreement with any member of its executive staff 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
no assurance can be given that their services will be available in the future 
the company s success will also be dependent on its ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
risks related to firearm sales the company has not  and  at present  does not intend to engage in the sale of handguns or assault rifles to the public 
the company does wholesale handguns and assault rifles to licensed firearm dealers 
the company has engaged in the sale of sporting rifles to the public leaving it open to the risk of lawsuits from persons who may claim injury as a result of an improper sale 
no such claims have been asserted against the company as of the date hereof 
the company does maintain insurance covering potential risks related to the sale of firearms 
risks related to automobile title loans alabama and georgia pawn regulations allow the company to advance funds secured by automobile titles 
approximately eight percent of the company s total revenues during fiscal were related to pawn service charges generated from such advances 
the adoption of additional or the revision of existing laws and regulations impacting the company s ability to advance funds against automobile titles could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company could be subject to consumer claims and litigation seeking damages based upon wrongful repossession of automobiles 
necessity to maintain current prospectus and registration statement the company must maintain an effective registration statement on file with the commission before any of the series a warrants or series b warrants collectively  the warrants may be redeemed or exercised 
it is possible that the company may be unable to cause a registration statement covering the common stock underlying the warrants to be effective 
it is also possible that the warrants could be acquired by persons residing in states where the company is unable to qualify the common stock underlying the warrants for sale 
in either event  the warrants may expire  unexercised  which would result in the holders losing all the value of the warrants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates related to its long term notes payable 
the company s revolving line of credit with comerica bank bears interest at a variable rate that is frequently adjusted on the basis of market rate changes and is equal to rates available for debt with similar characteristics 
accordingly  management believes that the carrying value of such debt approximates its fair value 
subsequent to january   the company commenced a public offering of the notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
as a result  the company s only interest rate risk is the opportunity loss associated with this debt should interest rates decline for debt with similar characteristics 
the aggregate maturities of long term notes payable for each of the five years subsequent to january  are as follows fiscal years ending january  total  the carrying amount of all other financial instruments included in the company s consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments
