item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the results of operations of the company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products on the us west coast 
increasing steel demand and prices led to improved profitability during the period of fiscal through fiscal primarily due to the asian financial crisis  which severly curtailed demand and decreased prices  fiscal and results for the metals recycling business were negatively impacted 
the company acquired proler  effective november  the following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the company s metals recycling business and steel manufacturing business  and the breakdown of income from operations between the metals recycling business  the steel manufacturing business and joint ventures 
additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues year ended august  in millions metals recycling business ferrous nonferrous other recycled metals total sales to the steel manufacturing business sales to unaffiliated customers steel manufacturing business total schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued income from operations year ended august  in millions metals recycling business steel manufacturing business joint ventures in the metals recycling business joint venture suppliers of metals corporate expense and eliminations income from operations includes the results of operations of proler from november   the date of acquisition  through august  ferrous recycled metal sales from the metals recycling business to the steel manufacturing business are made at a negotiated market rate per ton 
corporate expense and eliminations consist primarily of unallocated corporate expense for services that benefit both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business 
because of this unallocated expense  the income from operations of each segment does not reflect the income from operations the segment would have as a stand alone business 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues for both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business decreased resulting in an overall decline in consolidated revenues of to million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the asian financial crisis which began during fiscal continued to impact the results of both operations in fiscal the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  a decrease of million 
ferrous revenues declined million to million as a result of both lower volumes and lower average selling prices  both of which were primarily caused by the financial crisis in asia 
ferrous volumes declined  tons while the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal declined per ton to per ton 
the metals recycling business made export shipments  aggregating  tons  during fiscal compared with export shipments totaling  tons during the prior year 
domestic third party tonnage declined by to  tons 
sales to the company s steel business increased by to  tons 
the steel manufacturing business recognized revenues for fiscal of million  a decrease of from revenues recognized in the prior year 
although the volume of finished steel products sold increased  the average selling price per ton declined 
sales of finished steel products increased to  tons 
however  the average selling price declined per ton to per ton 
the company feels that the decline in average selling prices is attributable to the dumping of lower priced steel products by asian companies on the west coast 
the decline in the average selling price is also partially due to a change in product mix 
during fiscal  the steel manufacturing business shipped proportionately more lower priced products than in the prior year 
during fiscal  the company also sold  tons of billets  whereas in fiscal  sales of billets aggregated tons

form k part ii continued cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold declined million to million and increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit declined by million to million 
the metals recycling business cost of goods sold decreased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
cost of sales per ferrous ton declined  as the company lowered the purchase price of recycled metals metals at the scale in response to declining selling prices  and sales volumes declined 
however  because the average selling prices declined at a higher rate than the price of unprepared metal  gross profit for the metals recycling business declined million 
the metals recycling business did generate income from operations for fiscal of million  despite the adverse international financial climate in which it operated during the year 
the metals recycling business cost of goods sold for the year ended august  was lowered by a million reversal of environmental reserves 
an independent consultant was engaged to review the company s environmental issues and to determine its potential liabilities 
based upon the completion of certain projects at less than anticipated costs  certain previously established reserves were eliminated 
cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business declined million despite higher volumes sold during fiscal cost of sales per ton  excluding billets  declined by per ton primarily due to lower recycled metals prices 
the impact of lower average selling prices more than offset this decline in operating costs per ton  however  resulting in a gross profit of million which was million lower than in fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses declined million to as the company endeavored to contain overhead costs 
income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business  joint venture suppliers of metals   the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous metal 
the decrease in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to lower ferrous selling prices  the impact of which was partially offset by an increase in tonnage shipped 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures increased to million tons for the year ended august  from million tons in the prior year 
the increase in ferrous recycled metal was partially due to the fact that one of the joint ventures was organized during fiscal and  thus  fiscal s results only reflect a portion of a year s sales 
the average selling price of ferrous recycled metal declined during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to the asian financial crisis and a weaker domestic market which reduced demand in those countries that traditionally purchase a large share of the worldwide supply 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued the company s equity in income from the joint ventures in the metals recycling business for fiscal included the company s million share of a gain recognized by one of the joint ventures from the sale of property 
additionally  the results for fiscal also benefited from million of lifo and other inventory adjustments  compared with million for the prior year 
both revenues and income from the joint venture suppliers of metal declined from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to severe weather conditions in california during the first part of fiscal which impacted demand and  thus  results of the company s joint venture which operates self service used auto parts yards 
additionally  prices received for the auto bodies by this joint venture were lower than in the prior year due to weakness in the recycled metals markets 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million due to increased average borrowings  the effect of which was partially offset by lower average interest rates 
average borrowings of million in fiscal exceeded average borrowings in fiscal of million 
the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal gain loss on sale of assets 
during fiscal  the steel manufacturing business sold its union city  california mill depot  resulting in a gain of million

ferrous revenues decreased million as the result of a decrease in ferrous tons shipped at lower average selling prices 
sales to the company s steel manufacturing business were down slightly 
the metals recycling business made ferrous recycled metals export shipments totaling  tons in fiscal  compared with shipments totaling  tons in fiscal  while domestic third party tonnage increased to  tons 
the average selling price for ferrous recycled metals declined per ton to with the largest decline occurring in export prices during the second half of the steel manufacturing business revenues increased million to million 
higher volumes sold  coupled with an increase in selling prices  contributed to the increase 
average steel selling prices increased per ton to  while finished steel tons shipped increased  tons to  tons 
during fiscal  the steel manufacturing business also sold  tons of billets  compared with  tons during schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued cost of goods sold 
overall  cost of goods sold decreased million to million and increased as a percentage of revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit decreased million to million 
the metals recycling business cost of goods sold decreased million to million as the result of a decrease in ferrous tonnage shipped 
cost of sales per ferrous ton shipped remained unchanged from to the average selling price of ferrous recycled metals also declined  resulting in a decrease in the metals recycling business gross profit of million 
cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business increased million to million as the result of increased tonnage shipped 
cost of sales per ton decreased as the result of lower recycled metals prices and increased plant efficiencies 
this decrease  coupled with a per ton increase in the average selling price for finished steel and a increase in tonnage shipped  resulted in a million increase in overall gross profit and a increase in gross profit per ton for finished steel 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as the result of overhead added due to the proler acquisition in november income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals   income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business  joint venture suppliers of metals   the increase in revenues generated by the joint ventures in the metals recycling business from fiscal to fiscal was due to the fact that the company acquired an interest in the majority of these joint ventures through its acquisition of proler effective november  thus  the results for fiscal include the operations of these joint ventures since that date 
during fiscal  these joint ventures shipped million tons of ferrous recycled metals from its facilities compared with million tons from november through the end of fiscal on an annualized basis  tons declined year to year primarily as a result of the asian financial crisis 
the average selling price of ferrous recycled metals processed and sold from the joint ventures facilities declined from per ton to per ton also due to the financial crisis in asia 
the decrease in the company s share of income from the joint ventures in the metals recycling business from fiscal to fiscal resulted from operating losses due to the asian financial crisis 
also  the company s share of a 
million charge to income for the closure of redundant plant facilities and a million charge to state inventory at the lower of cost or market were included in the results for fiscal these were partially offset by million of other favorable inventory adjustments primarily related to lifo 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued revenues from the joint venture suppliers of metal increased by  contributing to an increase in the company s equity in earnings from these joint ventures of 
million 
for some of these joint ventures  revenues vary year to year depending upon the projects in which the joint ventures are engaged

in response to year compliance issues  the company has developed a systematic approach that consists of the following three phases identification and assessment of potential year issues  modification or replacement of equipment and software  final testing to ensure that all systems are year compliant after modifications are installed 
the company has divided its year issues into the following categories a physical hardware and related operating systems at the corporate data processing facility  b business and financial reporting systems at all locations  c personal computers and peripheral equipment at all locations  d facility and support systems including communication devices and safety systems at all locations  e manufacturing systems at its steel manufacturing business  f business systems for pick n pull  the company s self service auto dismantling joint venture 
the company has completed the identification and assessment phase 
the company has completed the modification of equipment at the corporate data processing facility  the business and financial reporting systems at all locations  personal computers at all locations  and the remainder of phase activities  except for pick n pull  which are expected to be complete by december  the company completed phase activities in october  except for pick n pull  which are expected to be complete by december  management estimates that the costs for correction of the year issues  including any software and hardware upgrades but excluding replacements that would have occurred even without the year issue  and the cost of personnel allocated to this project should not exceed  of which  is expected to be capital schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k part ii continued expenditures 
approximately  has been spent to date 
the year upgrades are being funded through normal operating funds and are expected to account for less than of the company s information technology it  maintenance and manufacturing capital budgets 
there can be no assurance that the costs and timeframes above will not change as the company continues its assessments 
the year project is a priority project for the company s it and engineering departments 
no significant it or engineering projects are being deferred as a result of the company s year efforts 
the company has also assessed the year readiness of its key vendors using questionnaires and letters 
no critical vendors have been found to be non compliant 
as the company is not dependent on any significant customer  and given the nature of the metals recycling business  no year assessment of customers is anticipated 
at the present time  the company has not expended the resources to develop a contingency plan with respect to year compliance as the company believes it will be year ready

form k part ii continued forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
one can identify these forward looking statements through the use of words such as expect  believe  and other words which convey a similar meaning 
one can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they are likely to address the company s business strategy  financial projections and results and other global factors affecting the company s financial prospects 
an example of this is the current financial crisis facing certain asian countries and year compliance matters 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following supply and demand conditions  the company s ability to mitigate the effects of the asian situation and foreign fiscal policies on its profitability  railroad service difficulties  competitive factors and pricing pressures from national steel companies  imports of foreign steel  availability of recycled metals supply  fluctuations in recycled metals prices and seasonality of results 
one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements 
consequently  the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
further  the company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates 
because such derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  they do not represent incremental risk to the company 
for further discussion of derivative financial instruments  refer to fair value of financial instruments in note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item as discussed in note long term debt to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the company was committed to interest rate swaps on a revolving credit facility at august  if market rates would have averaged percent higher than actual levels in either fiscal or fiscal  the effect on the company s interest expense and net income  after considering the effects of the interest rate swaps  would not have been material
