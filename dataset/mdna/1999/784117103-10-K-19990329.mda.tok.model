this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data 
we are organized around our four business lines technology services  mutual fund services  asset management  and investments in new business 
financial information on each of these segments is reflected in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included with item to this report

although consolidated revenues in were affected by the recognition of significant one time items  recurring revenues constitute approximately percent of total revenues 
technology services and asset management experienced significant increases in business activity beginning in late and extending into the inclusion of significant one time charges and increased investments in several product lines curtailed earnings growth in excluding the one time buyout fee and one time charges  revenue growth would have approximated percent and earnings growth would have approximated percent 
revenues and earnings are expected to increase in assuming the sales momentum in asset management can be sustained and once the new trust technology clients are successfully implemented 
however  continued consolidation in the banking industry and a prolonged unfavorable change in the financial markets could impede growth in revenues and earnings 
the effective tax rate from continuing operations was percent for  as compared to percent for income taxes are accounted for pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no

assets under management consist of total assets invested in our liquidity money market and short term mutual funds and non liquidity mutual funds family of funds for which we provide management services 
assets under administration consist of total assets for which we provide management and administration services  including client proprietary fund balances for which we only provide administration services 
technology services the technology services segment provides trust and investment accounting and management information services as an outsourcer to banks and other financial institutions with our trust product line 
trust incorporates a myriad of integrated products and sub systems to provide a complete trust accounting and investment system 
trust operations outsourcing incorporates the trust product line within a package of services that includes custody and other back office capabilities 
through this business  we handle a trust department s back office administration function 
this allows trust department managers to concentrate on expanding and servicing their clients 
dollar percent change change revenues trust technology services    trust operations outsourcing    total revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    total operating profits    trust technology services revenues consists of the monthly processing and software application fees from the trust product line  project fees associated with the conversion of new clients onto the trust product line  management fees for assets invested in our liquidity funds from bank clients  and bank related brokerage services 
a significant one time contractual buyout fee from a client involved in an acquisition increased revenues in new trust technology client relationships established in favorably affected recurring processing fees by an incremental million and nonrecurring implementation fees by an incremental million in conversely  when a client prematurely terminates its contract for processing services  recurring processing fees are negatively affected in future periods and a one time contractual buyout fee is received 
buyout fees are recognized in income when the client is completely removed from the trust product line 
as a result of lost trust technology clients in  million in one time contractual buyout fees were recognized and recurring processing fees decreased million 
revenues earned from bank clients utilizing our liquidity products and brokerage services increased percent or million  but only accounts for approximately percent of total trust technology services revenues recognized in and the recurring processing fee base is projected to increase as these new trust technology clients are successfully implemented onto the trust product line by mid consolidations in the banking industry could provide additional opportunities or could negatively affect future revenues depending on its effect on our trust technology client base 
trust operations outsourcing revenues experienced another year of strong growth 
revenues are derived from processing and management fees 
revenues earned from processing services accounts for approximately percent in and percent in of total trust operations outsourcing revenues  while custody and investment solutions comprise the remaining percent in and percent in assets under custody were billion at december  and billion at december  new client relationships established in provided significant growth in this business 
although revenues from this segment increased percent and operating profits increased percent during  profit margin only increased slightly to percent for  as compared to percent for the contracting of new clients and the recognition of a substantial one time buyout fee increased operating profits in however  increases in operating expenses to maintain these new client relationships and a one time write off of capitalized software development costs negatively affected operating profits in as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses increased slightly to percent from percent and sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly to percent from percent 
operating and development expenses in increased mainly due to increased business activity  a stronger commitment to enhancing products  the write off of previously capitalized software development costs  and the direct correlation between bank related brokerage services revenues and direct expenses 
the contracting of new clients required additional personnel and other related operating costs in order to properly implement  service  and maintain these new relationships 
additionally  substantial investments were incurred to analyze and improve the implementation process for new clients 
these investments included process redesign and infrastructure reinvention 
operating and development expenses were significantly affected in due to several factors associated with software development costs 
first  each year  we evaluate strategies for new and existing software products  as well as performing a recoverability assessment of software development projects currently in production 
the recoverability assessment included an evaluation of expected future revenues and cash flows  acceptability of the software product in its target market  a cost benefit analysis as to the delivery and support of the software product  and any technological advancements that could enhance or render the product obsolete 
as a result  certain projects were considered either obsolete or incapable of achieving the expected results in their original design and approximately million of net software development costs previously capitalized were written off during the fourth quarter of second  in order to keep a competitive edge  substantial investments in research and development costs for the trust product line were incurred during finally  with the completion and subsequent release of several capitalized software development projects  amortization expense increased during operating profits are expected to increase in this expectation is based upon the fact that several new trust technology clients are near completion of the implementation process  which should more than offset any negative effect on operating profits from lost clients 
once these clients are successfully implemented  recurring processing fees are expected to increase without any significant corresponding increase in variable costs 
also  operating profits should be favorably affected if sales momentum of the trust operations outsourcing product continues 
consolidations in the banking industry could affect future operating profits depending on how our clients are affected 
mutual fund services the mutual fund services segment provides administration and distribution services to proprietary mutual funds created for banks  insurance firms  and investment management companies 
these services include fund administration and accounting  legal  shareholder recordkeeping  and marketing 
dollar percent change change total revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    total operating profits   mutual fund services revenues are earned through administrative fees that are based upon a fixed percentage  referred to as basis points  of the average daily net asset value of the proprietary funds 
the amount of basis points earned is specific to each proprietary fund complex and can vary among complexes 
the increase in revenues was primarily fueled by growth in existing complexes and the conversion of a large bank complex in average proprietary fund balances increased billion or percent to billion for versus billion for growth in average proprietary fund balances resulted from banks being able to successfully convince their customers to invest assets into bank sponsored mutual funds 
average basis points earned decreased in primarily due to a reduction in pricing for some larger clients in order to solidify long term relationships and the loss of some higher margin relationships 
however  the outlook for mutual fund services revenues remains optimistic 
increased emphasis in the non bank and offshore markets has produced some positive results 
some recent successes achieved in the non bank and offshore markets included the signing of a large non bank client in mid that will fund approximately billion in assets by early  and increased business activity offshore 
although revenues increased percent  operating profits only increased percent 
profit margin in decreased to percent  as compared to percent for a significant increase in operating and development expenses negatively affected operating profits in as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses increased to percent from percent 
two primary factors contributed to this increase 
there is a direct correlation between revenues and certain direct expenses 
the increase in revenues during generated an incremental million in direct proprietary expenses 
also  with the increased business activity and emphasis on other markets  back office operational costs increased  in order to maintain quality service for existing clients and to establish distribution channels and name recognition internationally 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expenses remained flat at percent for and the combination of reduced pricing for some larger clients  the loss of some higher margin relationships  and increased operating costs decreased profit margin in profit margin is expected to remain relatively flat in expanding services into the non bank and offshore markets could produce additional opportunities 
however  continued consolidations in the banking industry and a significant prolonged unfavorable change in the financial markets could negatively affect revenues and profits 
asset management the asset management segment provides investment solutions through various investment products and services distributed directly or through professional investment advisors  financial planners  and other financial intermediaries to institutional or high net worth markets

substantial increases in average assets under management generated the percent increase in revenues 
average assets under management increased billion or percent to billion during  as compared to billion during investment solutions offered to high net worth investors through registered investment advisors  financial planners  and other financial intermediaries produced strong sales gains during these gains result from a unique product that allows the investment advisor to dedicate more effort to increasing assets rather than administering record keeping and processing tasks 
additionally  many new institutional clients were contracted for services in the sales momentum established in the registered investment advisors market is projected to continue 
liquidity management fees consist of our money market  short term mutual funds and cash sweep technology that are marketed to corporations and investment firms 
the percent increase in liquidity management fees was mainly driven by an increase in average assets under management and increased sales of the cash sweep technology product 
the asset management segment experienced a significant increase in operating profits primarily due to growth in assets under management 
profit margin in also improved substantially 
profit margin rose to percent for  as compared to percent for as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses decreased to percent from percent and sales and marketing expenses decreased to percent from percent 
our ability to leverage on our infrastructure resulted in improved margins as revenues increased with minimal incremental variable operating costs 
with the increased sales momentum and the ability to leverage on our infrastructure  this segment is expected to produce favorable operating results in however  any significant devaluation in the financial markets could negatively affect revenues and profits 
investments in new business investments in new business consist of our canadian and international operations 
products being offered in canada include investment advisory  performance evaluation and other consulting services to canadian pension plans 
international operations consist of various investment products and services providing investment solutions to institutional and high net worth investors outside north america

our efforts are currently focused on four main regions europe  east asia  latin america  and south africa 
as a percentage of total segment revenues  these offshore enterprises accounted for approximately percent in  as compared to percent in revenues from any one region were immaterial as a percentage of total segment revenues 
operating results were affected by substantial investments made in foreign markets 
our strategy is to team with local partners to establish name recognition and distribution channels for our investment products and services 
additionally  operating results were negatively affected by million associated with the write off of customer lists from a foreign acquisition see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
continued investment into offshore arenas will remain the primary focus for this business segment

when a client terminates its contract for processing services  recurring processing fees are negatively affected in future periods 
as a result  recurring processing fees in decreased approximately million associated with these lost clients

average proprietary fund balances increased billion or percent from billion during to billion during average basis points earned on proprietary funds decreased primarily due to a new contract established with one of our largest non bank proprietary clients in mid that reduced the amount of revenues earned from that complex 
this decrease in administrative fees earned was offset by an equal reduction in direct proprietary fund expenses 
the growth in proprietary fund balances was mainly fueled by growth in existing proprietary fund complexes 
this growth in existing complexes was primarily the result of banks becoming more successful at selling mutual funds and the favorable stock market environment 
additionally  proprietary fund balances were affected by regulatory changes in that permit the transfer of common trust assets into proprietary mutual funds on a tax free basis 
operating profits and profit margin in increased primarily due to a significant increase in proprietary fund balances 
profit margin was percent for and percent in as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses decreased to percent from percent and sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat

however  average basis points earned decreased slightly in due to clients transferring funds into lower fee liquidity products 
additionally  the increase in revenues was slightly influenced by growth in our cash sweep services to smaller banks

profit margin increased to percent for  as compared to a negative percent in as a percentage of sales  operating and development expenses decreased to percent from percent 
this decrease is due to our ability to leverage on our infrastructure without incurring significant additional operating costs

we currently have a line of credit agreement that provides for borrowings of up to  the availability of the line of credit is subject to compliance with certain covenants set forth in the agreement see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the unused sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of  and the unused portion of the line of credit of  cash flow generated from operations in primarily resulted from an increase in income  increased receivables collections  and an increase in accrued compensation and various accrued liabilities 
the increase in accrued compensation and various accrued liabilities resulted from increased business activity during accrued compensation is paid annually in the first quarter of the following year 
cash flow provided by operations in was negatively affected by an increase in receivables 
as a result of the contracting of new trust clients in  a substantial increase in unbilled receivables relating to implementation fees was experienced 
this increase in unbilled receivables results from timing differences between services provided and contractual billing schedules 
cash flows provided by operations were also affected by several other factors 
receivables from regulated investment companies increased in and primarily due to an increase in assets under management 
these balances are paid off in the following month 
in and  cash flows from operations were favorably affected by the sales of loans classified as loans receivable available for sale  whereas  cash flows from operations in were negatively affected by the purchase of these loans 
cash flows from investing activities are principally affected by capital expenditures  including capitalized software development costs 
capital expenditures included significant costs associated with the construction and subsequent expansion of our corporate campus 
construction of the corporate campus began in late and was completed in late construction of an additional building within the corporate campus began in early and was completed in early as of february    has been spent on the new building and we expect the total cost to be approximately  capitalized software development costs in   and primarily result from continued investments in the trust product line  especially the open architecture project and a concentrated effort to address year compliance issues 
in   in net proceeds were received from the sale of marketable securities classified as investments available for sale 
cash flows from financing activities are primarily affected by debt and equity transactions

as of february   sei still had  remaining authorized for the purchase of our common stock 
proceeds received from the issuance of common stock  including tax benefit  rose substantially in primarily due to increased stock option activity and the rapid increase in our common stock share price 
our operating cash flow  borrowing capacity  and liquidity should provide adequate funds for continuing operations  continued investment in new products and equipment  our common stock repurchase program  future dividend payments  and principal and interest payments on our long term debt 
discontinued operations in may  the board of directors approved a plan of disposal for the sei capital resources division cr and the sei defined contribution retirement services division dc 
cr provided investment performance evaluation services  consulting services  and brokerage services to employee benefit plan sponsors and investment advisors in the united states 
cr was sold to a private investment firm on december  dc provided administrative and processing services  recordkeeping services  and employee retirement planning materials for use by defined contribution plans

a provision for the disposal of cr and dc was established in the fourth quarter of that included certain estimates relating to future commitments on certain operating leases utilized by cr 
these estimates were based upon certain assumptions relating to the sub leasing of these facilities 
in  these sub lease arrangements were finalized 
as a result  the original discontinued operations provision was overstated and accordingly was reduced by  net of tax expense of  and is reflected in income from disposal of discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
assessment of risks associated with the year background we began work on the year issue in with management recognition that failure to acknowledge  analyze and remediate potential year processing issues could result in material consequences to our financial position and operating results 
through early  we focused our efforts on an assessment of our trust product line and by mid  we expanded our efforts to include a review of all proprietary systems  vendors  internally used systems  and any other item that may be affected by the year a corporate year committee was formed consisting of representatives from every area of our business and is managed by a full time senior project manager 
this committee reports regularly to the board of directors on the progress and status of our year efforts 
the year program encompasses all system hardware and software  physical facilities  utilities  electronic equipment and communications  as well as all other ancillary purchased products and services 
our year program fully subscribes to the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines 
state of readiness in accordance with ffiec guidelines  year remediation and time dimensional testing for all proprietary applications  including trust  was completed 
the final release of trust year remediated code was released into production in late all trust clients have been provided with the opportunity to review the actual year test scripts and test results and or conduct their own time dimensional testing 
with the completion of remediation and testing of all proprietary systems  we proceeded with vendor testing 
a corporate intranet database was established to track and evaluate the compliance status of all vendors and their products 
each vendor product within this database has been assigned to a specific coordinator who is responsible for communications and certification of vendor products 
the vendor products have been evaluated using the following criterion to establish the vendor relationship business risk products importance to mission critical functionality failure risk likelihood of vendor achieving or not achieving year compliance on time compliance code based on communications from vendor and or test results 
as of early  approximately percent of vendor products had been certified as year compliant within ffiec guidelines 
the remaining percent are on target to be fully compliant by mid all systems in use for internal business purposes  including  but not limited to  network  accounting  communications and power supply  have been tested or are in the process of being modified for year compliance 
internal use systems requiring modifications will be mitigated through enhancements to existing software and hardware or conversions to new software and hardware 
costs to address year issues the cost of year remediation and testing of the trust product line is projected to be million 
through december   approximately million has been spent  of which approximately million has been capitalized pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additional spending of million is projected for and approximately million is estimated for contingency plans in the year the spending dedicated to the trust product line represents the material costs incurred to achieve year compliance 
all year compliance costs for all other proprietary systems  including those used for internal business purposes  were expensed as incurred or capitalized if new software or hardware was purchased 
these costs were immaterial 
any future costs incurred associated with ancillary systems or equipment is not expected to be material 
no planned development projects were delayed or cancelled as a result of year compliance efforts 
risks of the year issues every effort has been made to mitigate any potential risk resulting from the roll over to the year however  we believe that despite all of our best efforts  there still exists the potential of experiencing minor to moderate system issues at the beginning of the year in anticipation of these risks  we are planning the following actions work closely with all clients to instruct them on maintaining all year end data for recovery purposes 
current year project expertise will remain dedicated to the year program to be available to resolve potential issues 
budget funds into the year to support potential issues 
all future product releases will be analyzed for potential date related changes 
if such a change is identified as having an impact to our year certification  tests will be performed to re certify the modified code 
to reconfirm the trust product line as year compliant  a full re certification of compliance will be conducted in the third quarter of as part of our corporate year due diligence  all of our insurance programs were reviewed with regard to the year there are no specific year exclusions in any of our policies 
in addition  we have reviewed and will continue to review the status of our year program efforts with our insurance carriers 
contingency plans contingency planning efforts have been focused on the most critical business functions and vary significantly based on a system s functionality and how it operates 
manual overrides exist for many functions and in some cases alternative suppliers or delivery channels have been identified 
the contingency strategy for our own proprietary products focuses on additional planned resources to react in the year a plan exists to identify  correct and release year related core and custom problems in the quickest fashion possible 
a rapid response team will be available during peak processing times that will execute this plan 
clients will be apprised of the plan and advised on appropriate data retention 
in the event electrical suppliers are not year compliant and an interruption in electrical services occurs  each facility has a backup generator that will supply necessary electrical service to core processing systems and databases

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do have several offices located outside the united states that conduct business in the local currencies of that country 
we do not use foreign currency exchange contracts or other types of derivative financial investments to hedge local currency cash flows
