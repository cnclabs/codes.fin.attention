through november   the loans contained a provision allowing the bank mandatory repayment upon days written notice after five years  which resulted in the unpaid principal  balances being reflected as a current liability

an unaffiliated maryland dialysis center  competitive with the company  continues to lease space from the company in its building 
the pennsylvania center relocated during and the company constructed its own dialysis facility at the property that commenced treatments in june see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has an equipment financing agreement for kidney dialysis machines for its facilities 
there was additional financing of  during pursuant to this agreement 
there was an outstanding balance of  at december  and  at december  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  the company repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock for approximately  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in february   the company redeemed the minority interest in two of its subsidiaries whose assets were included in the florida dialysis operations sale for a total consideration of  including  cash and one half of the purchaser s securities valued at  with the total value of  for securities received having been guaranteed by the purchaser 
the company opened its fourth center in manahawkin  new jersey and received regulatory approval as a medicare provider during the fourth quarter of and opened its fifth center in chambersburg  pennsylvania during the first quarter of and is developing another dialysis center in new jersey 
capital is needed primarily for the development of outpatient dialysis centers 
the construction of a station facility  typically the size of the company s dialysis facilities  costs in the range of  to  de pending on location  size and related services to be provided  which includes equipment and initial working capital requirements 
acquisition of an existing dialysis facility may range from  to  per patient  and  therefore  is more expensive than construction  although acquisition provides the company with an immediate ongoing operation  which most likely would be generating in come 
development of a dialysis facility to initiate operations takes four to six months and usually months or longer to generate income 
the company has entered into agreements with medical directors  and intends to establish additional facilities in the new jersey and pennsylvania area 
the company  having operated on a larger scale in the past  is seeking to expand its outpatient dialysis treatment facilities and inpatient dialysis care 
such expansion  whether through acquisitions of existing centers or the development of its own dialysis centers requires capital  which was the basis for the company s security offering in and sale of its florida dialysis operations in no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in implementing its growth strategy or that the funds from its securities offering and florida dialysis operations sale will be adequate to finance such expansion 
see item  business business strategy and notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that current levels of working capital  including the proceeds of its securities offering and the sale of its florida dialysis operations  will enable it to successfully meet its liquidity demands for at least the next twelve months as well as expand its dialysis facilities and thereby its patient base 
year readiness the year computer information processing challenge associated with the upcoming millennium change concerns the ability of computerized information systems to properly recognize date sensitive information  with which many companies  public and private  are faced to ensure continued proper operations and reporting of financial condition 
failure to correct and comply with the year change may cause systems that cannot recognize the new date and millenium information to generate erroneous data or to fail to operate 
management is fully aware of the year issues  has made its assessments and has basically evaluated its computerized systems and equipment  and communicated with its major vendors  and has made the operations of the company year compliant 
one of the most significant risks in the company s operations with respect to the upcoming millenium change relates to billing and collection from third party payors  and  in particular  medicare 
the company receives approximately of its revenues from medicare for treatment of dialysis patients and related services 
although recent reports from the federal government have indicated the potential for certain agencies and commissions not to be year compliant by january   hcfa  through whom the medicare program and payments are effected  has indicated it has done and continues to accomplish all it can to insure the medicare esrd program continues operating smoothly and that dialysis providers  like the company  may continue to timely bill electronically for patient services with medicare payments to be made timely 
in fact  in  the company installed a new electronic billing software program that was developed according to medicare s compliance guidelines  which guidelines require not only system but also year compatibility 
the software designer has successfully tested the software for year compliance and the company initiated its electronic medicare billing in january  without any problems 
other third party payors  such as insurance companies  are presently and will continue to be billed with hard copy 
the costs of the software modifications have been minimal  approximately  and the company does not anticipate that any costs involved in any future year compliance will be material or that they will have a material adverse effect on its business 
with respect to non information technology systems  which typically include embedded technology  such as microcontrollers  the major equipment used in patient dialysis treatment is not date sensitive and should not pose any threat of a system breakdown due to the year issue 
most of the company s dialysis equipment is new 
see item  business operations of dialysis facilities and item  properties 
the company retains technicians who test and maintain dialysis operations equipment 
in addition to addressing its own internal software system  the company has communicated with all its suppliers  service providers and other key third parties  including payroll system providers  banks  hospitals and insurance companies with whom it deals to determine the extent of their year compliance  what actions they are taking to assess and address that issue  and whether they will be compliant by the end of to the extent such third parties are materially adversely affected by the year issue and their problem has not been timely corrected  the company s operations could be affected 
the company has received written assurance from many of these third parties indicating that they are year compliant or are working on it and expect to be by the end of  and that the crucial supplies and services that are necessary to the company s operation and patient treatment including drug and chemical supplies  utilities  cable  waste removal  water and sewer services will not be affected by the millenium change 
the company s current bookkeeping  financial records and statements  and accounting are accomplished through certain common officers and personnel and facilities with medicore  its parent 
see item  certain relationships and related transactions 
the system covering these programs was recently installed by medicore s other public subsidiary  techdyne  inc  which utilizes the visual manufacturing system for other purposes as well  including inventory maintenance  manufacturing and for overall operations 
management is evaluating new  year compliant accounting packages  which would provide the company with its own independent system of bookkeeping  accounting and financial records and reduce its dependence on its parent s personnel and facilities 
management anticipates such new  year compliant accounting and bookkeeping system to be ready mid the cost of such new accounting system is estimated in a range of approximately  to  another area that could significantly impact the company s operations in providing dialysis treatment to patients relates to third party providers  specifically  the utility companies providing water  an extremely necessary resource for dialysis treatments  and electricity 
these providers and services are beyond the control of the company  and the company does not have a separate generator for electricity nor other sources for water 
should any of these utilities fail to provide services  such would seriously adversely impact the company  its patients  as well as the company s competitors in such affected areas 
there can be no assurance  however  that the year issues  whether internal and believed to have been addressed  or from third parties  although the company has checked and been assured that its third party payors and suppliers are year compliant or will be prior to the end of  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
other matters the company does not consider its exposure to market risks  principally changes in interest rates  to be significant 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on the company s investments is managed by conservatively investing liquid funds in short term government securities of which the company held approximately  at december  interest rate risk on debt is managed by negotiation of appropriate rates for equipment financing obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with the company s variable rate mortgage obligations which totaled  at december  the company has exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
a decrease in rates on its year end investments in government securities and a increase in rates on its year end mortgage debt would result in a negative impact of approximately  on its result of operations 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or spec ulative purposes and does not currently use interest rate derivatives 
new accounting pronouncements in june   the financial accounting standards board issued finan cial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas 
fas is effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  fas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires  among other things  that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and that those instruments be measured at fair value 
the company is in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of fas will have on its con solidated financial statements 
impact of inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on the company s operations 
a substantial portion of the company s revenue is subject to reimbursement rates established and regulated by the federal government 
these rates do not automatically adjust for inflation 
any rate adjustments relate to legislation and executive and congressional budget demands  and have little to do with the actual cost of doing business 
see operations medicare reimbursement and government regulation under item  business 
therefore  dialysis services revenues cannot be voluntary increased to keep pace with increases in nursing and other patient care costs 
increased operating costs without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates may adversely affect the company s earnings in the future
