midas identifies and qualifies franchisees through a well organized recruitment program in each region of the world in which it operates 
franchisees are qualified based primarily upon a candidate s financial suitability and operational experience  among other criteria 
midas also considers a franchisee s ability to work within the midas franchise system

the following summarizes portions of the franchise and trademark agreement used in the us the us franchise agreement 
term and fees  estimated costs  royalty payments 
the initial term of the us franchise agreement  as well as most midas franchise and trademark agreements throughout the world  is twenty years 
the us franchise agreement may be terminated by the franchisee upon thirty days written notice 
in most instances in the us  midas retains  through real estate agreements between franchisees and midas realty described below  the ability to occupy a site in the event of a termination of the applicable franchise and trademark agreement in order to assure that the site may continue to be operated as a midas shop 
an initial franchise fee is charged upon execution of a franchise and trademark agreement 
in opening a midas shop  a franchisee makes additional expenditures relating to fixtures  machinery and equipment and initial product inventory

realty agreements 
since the mid s  midas has required each us franchisee to enter into an agreement with midas realty giving midas realty the ability to occupy a site in the event of a termination of the related franchise and trademark agreement in order to ensure that the site may continue to be operated as a midas shop if midas chooses 
the agreement with midas realty remains in effect throughout the term of the related franchise and trademark agreement 
when midas realty owns the real estate or has the primary lease on a midas shop  the franchisee is required to lease or sublease the midas shop from midas realty 
if the franchisee owns the real estate  the franchisee is required to provide midas with real estate control through one of two alternative means 
the first alternative provides for the lease by the franchisee to midas realty of the premises  which in turn leases the premises back to the franchisee 
so long as the franchisee continues to be both the landowner and the franchisee of that shop  no rent is exchanged between the franchisee and midas realty 
if the real estate is sold to a third party or if the franchised midas shop is sold to a new franchisee to whom the sublease is assigned  midas realty will then collect rent from the franchisee and pay rent to the landowner 
under the second alternative the franchisee enters into a conditional option to lease with midas realty which grants midas realty the option to lease the premises in the event that the related franchise agreement is terminated 
if the franchisee leases real estate from a third party upon which the midas shop is located  midas requires that the franchisee grant to midas realty a conditional assignment of the lease to take effect upon the termination of the related franchise and trademark agreement

percentage of sales and revenues percentage change vs vs replacement parts sales company operated shop retail sales royalties real estate rental revenues other sales and revenues cost of sales and revenues selling  general and administrative expenses operating income before business transformation costs business transformation costs operating income loss other income expense  net interest expense income loss before taxes income taxes benefit net income loss introduction beginning in and carrying forward into  the company began to experience declines in earnings and returns on assets and equity 
these trends were due to a combination of slow growth  or in some cases declines in sales and revenues from certain business activities  increasing operating expenses and an expanding asset base 
these trends  coupled with an expected substantial increase in the company s long term debt as a result of the spin off of midas as an independent company by whitman corporation  led management to conduct an in depth review of current strategies and potential alternative strategies to reverse these trends 
forthcoming from this strategic review was a business strategy to focus the company s management and financial resources on expanding the north american and european franchise network by adding services and new shops  improving relationships with franchisees  improving the efficiency of the wholesale replacement part distribution system  reducing operating expenses and redeploying assets by franchising company operated shops 
in  the company reached an agreement with magneti marelli  spa a member of the fiat group  to form a strategic alliance to accelerate the development of the midas system in europe and south america 
midas management concluded that magneti marelli had the financial and human resources to accelerate the development of the midas business in europe and south america at a much faster pace than the company 
midas management also concluded that the proceeds from a transaction with magneti marelli could provide the company with additional financial resources which would enable the company to accelerate the execution of its strategy to transform and grow the north american franchise network 
page accordingly  midas sold its interests in europe and south america to magneti marelli for million in october  and entered into a licensing agreement for the midas trademarks and know how as a part of the transaction 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s business strategy was further modified to the current strategy which is to become a focused and efficient operator of a north american franchise and wholesale parts distribution network and a licensor of midas trademarks and know how outside of north america 
the business transformation process resulted in costs that were recorded in both and  which are summarized in the following table 
in millions franchisee incentive payments disposition of company operated shops corporate office relocation integration of canadian administration function 
consolidation of north american distribution system special one time return program changes to us franchisee advertising program us asset write downs to recognize impairments severance and other costs business transformation costs before tax benefits 
income tax benefits business transformation costs  net of tax benefits additional information regarding each of the business transformation costs listed in the above summary is presented in note to the financial statements 
because of changes in the company s business strategy  the type of operational  legal and financial control of the midas shops changed substantially in the geographic location and the method of operation of the shops in operation at december  and  are presented below 
midas retail shops year ended december north america franchised    company operated total north america    international franchised licensed company operated total international worldwide franchised licensed    company operated total worldwide    although the number of shops in operation remained relatively constant over the past year  the number of shops operated by the company declined by shops or and the number of shops operating under a franchise or license agreement increased by shops or almost 
this shift in the type of shop operation reflects the sale of midas europe and the strategy to focus on franchising 
by mid  it is expected that virtually all of the midas shops worldwide will be operated by either franchisees or licensees 
page the approximately  midas shops currently in operation worldwide offer some or all of the following services  exhaust  brake  suspension  air conditioning  batteries and a number of other routine maintenance services 
the company s business strategy is to expand these service offerings in the future 
the business strategy of focusing the company on growing the north american franchisee network is expected to have a significant impact on the future sources of revenue for the company 
the european operations and company operated shops outside of europe accounted for million or almost of the million of the company s sales and revenues for if the sale of the midas business in europe had occurred at the beginning of the year  and all non european company operated shops had been franchised or licensed as of the start of  the company would have reported sales and revenues for in the million range
