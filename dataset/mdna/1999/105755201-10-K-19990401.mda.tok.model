background brazilian political environment the brazilian political environment has been marked by high levels of uncertainty since the country returned to civilian rule in after years of military government 
the death of a president in and the resignation of another president in the midst of impeachment proceedings in  as well as rapid turnover at and immediately below the cabinet level  have adversely affected the implementation of consistent economic and monetary policies  including consistent policies in the areas of government owned enterprises and telecommunications 
measures by the government intended to influence the course of brazil s economy eg actions to control inflation  interest rates or consumption have been frequent and occasionally drastic 
changes in policy  social instability or other political or economic developments  and the brazilian government s responses to such developments  may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
mr 
fernando henrique cardoso was elected president of brazil in october and took office in january for a single four year term 
he has generally sought to continue the economic stabilization and liberalization policies he developed as finance minister from may through april under president itamar franco 
president cardoso is the leader of a coalition of political parties that represents a majority of the federal congress and his party controls the state governments of the states of sao paulo and others 
brazil s constitution was amended in to permit president cardoso to stand for re election to a second four year term 
although president cardoso s policies appear to have broad political support and he was re elected in october for another four year term  his policies have suffered major setbacks in  including the failure of brazil s congress to pass social security reform and various austerity measures on government spending 
there can be no assurance that president cardoso s policies will not be revised in whole or in part at some future date 
furthermore  some important groups remain opposed to significant elements of his program  and the implementation of any policies of economic stabilization or liberalization is subject to significant compromises and accommodations 
economic environment the financial condition and results of operations of the company are dependent on general economic conditions in brazil  and in particular on i economic growth and its impact on demand for fast food services and ii exchange rates between brazilian and foreign currencies 
historically  the brazilian economy has been extremely volatile  and the government has implemented a succession of programs intended to stabilize the economy and provide a basis for sustainable  non inflationary growth 
venbo has been affected by such programs in a variety of ways  particularly when such programs have resulted in contractions in demand or very high real interest rates 
beginning in december  the government introduced the real plan  an economic stabilization program intended to reduce the rate of inflation by reducing certain public expenditures  collecting liabilities owed to the government  increasing tax revenues  continuing to privatize government owned entities and introducing a new currency 
the real was introduced as brazil s currency in july  based on a monetary correction index  the urv  introduced earlier in the year 
since taking office in january  president cardoso has continued to implement the real plan 
under the real plan  the rate of inflation has decreased significantly  and the rate of growth of real gross domestic product has increased substantially 
since mid  brazil has faced continuing deficits in its payment balance and  simultaneously  the market began to doubt the government s capability to reduce public spending 
based on these and other reasons  including massive outflows of foreign capital in the first two weeks of january  brazil devalued its currency 
brazil and the imf have recently reached an agreement whereby brazil would receive  under certain conditions such as minimum level of country reserves and reversal of public spending deficit  a billion bail out package 
the long term effects upon brazil in general and the company in particular of i the real plan and ii the devaluation and success of the bail out package  are uncertain 
effects of inflation and devaluation brazil has experienced extremely high and generally unpredictable rates of inflation and of devaluation of brazilian currency for many years 
since the introduction of the real plan in july  the rate of inflation has decreased considerably 
as measured through by the unidade fiscal de referencia the ufir and by the indice geral de precos mercado the igp m thereafter  the annualized rate of inflation was  for the first six months of  for the last six months of and for the year  with significantly all of s inflation occurring during the first six months of that year 
the annual rate of inflation during was as compared to in and in s inflation is expected to be high due to a devaluation of the real 
although there is no way to predict s inflation rate  experts predict an annual rate of inflation of between and due to brazil s economic recession  the size of the public deficit and the difficulty to sustain external reserves 
the following table sets forth brazilian inflation  as measured by the ufir igp m  and the devaluation of the brazilian currency against the us dollar for the periods shown 
year ended december  inflation ufir igp m devaluation brazilian currency annualized rates see selected historical financial data exchange rates 
the company s results of operations in   and have been affected by inflation  and such financial information should be evaluated in light of the methodology for recognition of the effects of inflation 
see selected financial data 
significant effects include the following 
effects of purchasing power gains and losses on revenues 
inflation produces purchasing power losses on accounts receivable between the date of service and the date of payment by the customer 
these losses are partly offset by purchasing power gains on accounts payable and accrued expenses  value added taxes and other taxes on operating revenues between the date of accrual and the date of payment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 

effects of inflation on financial instruments denominated in brazilian currency 
the company has both assets and liabilities that are financial instruments denominated in brazilian currency 
until july   the indexation of principal was provided for according to the index specified in the relevant instrument subsequent to that time  only interest was impacted by indexation 
as of july   the company s management determined that brazil no longer had a hyperinflationary economy as defined in sfas and ceased indexing the company s consolidated financial statements for constant currency purchasing power 
in the consolidated financial statements of the company  interest income or expense is reported net of the associated inflationary losses or gains  respectively  and accordingly depends on the relationship between the rate of interest and  where applicable  indexation of principal and the rate of inflation as measured by the ufir  which is used to determine inflationary gains and losses 
for example  indebtedness denominated in reais gives rise to interest expense to the extent that the rates of interest plus indexation exceed the rate of inflation  and it may give rise to negative interest expense if the rates of interest plus indexation are less than the rate of inflation 

effects of inflation and devaluation on indebtedness denominated in foreign currency 
at december   the company had r  of indebtedness denominated principally in us dollars 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company does not hedge its obligations under its foreign currency denominated indebtedness 
in the consolidated financial statements of the company  the interest expense attributable to foreign currency denominated indebtedness is reported net of the associated inflationary gain and foreign exchange loss 
when the rate of inflation and the rate of devaluation differ substantially  the effect on reported interest expense can be substantial 
see selected financial data exchange rates and note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the company s financial statements are presented in accordance with us gaap and accordingly recognize certain effects of inflation and restate data from prior periods in constant reais of june  purchasing power 
such restatement has been effected using the integral restatement method correcao integral required by the cvm the brazilian securities commission to be used for financial statements of public corporations 
in periods of inflation  monetary assets generate inflationary loss  and monetary liabilities generate inflationary gain  due to the decline in purchasing power of the currency 
inflationary gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities have been allocated to their corresponding income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
inflationary gains or losses without a corresponding income or expense caption have been allocated to other net operating income expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations since the implementation of real plan in june  the brazilian economy has experienced declining levels of inflation rates  with a cumulative inflation rate for the three year period from july to june  as measured by the igp m a brazilian general price index  of 
the inflation rate since june  and through december  as measured by the igp m  was approximately per annum 
considering the above  and notwithstanding new inflationary pressures now facing brazil  management has made the determination that brazil should no longer be considered a highly inflationary economy from july  onward  pursuant to fasb accordingly  operating results for the periods ended december  and presented in the accompanying financial statements have been indexed and expressed in currency of constant purchasing power of june  by using a monthly index derived from igp m index 
the company believes that the igp m index is an appropriate general price inflation indicator to be used under us gaap 
from july   the company no longer indexed its financial statements for constant currency purchasing power

restaurant sales net restaurant sales for company owned stores were r  r  and r  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
same store sales for the year ended december  declined when compared to the year ended december the approximately decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to the following factors 
the closing of five company owned outlets in the year ended december   the sale of outlets to franchisees and the opening of new outlets  for a total of company owned stores as of december  this reflects the company s strategy to limit company direct operations to highly profitable outlets  and to focus on the growth of franchises  which management anticipates will significantly reduce the level of the company s future capital expenditures 

brazil s economic recession  stemming from the so called asian crisis and exacerbated thereafter by the worsening russian economy  resulted in a significant outflow of foreign investment 
measures taken by the brazilian central bank in december to stem such outflow included materially raising interest rates  which substantially increased the cost of consumer indebtedness  with a corresponding reduction in discretionary consumer spending 

increased competition  resulting in an approximately average price reduction in the sales prices of the company s food and beverage offerings  in may 
economic concerns caused by the then uncertain outcome of the brazilian national election in october adversely affected consumer spending during the months leading up to the election 

significant reductions in store patronage during normally busy luncheon and early evening hours in june and july as a consequence of contemporaneous broadcasts of world cup soccer matches involving the brazilian national team 
franchise income franchise income was r  r  and r  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of and in and  respectively  is primarily due to the expansion of franchised locations  which increased from an average of units in to units in to units in at december   and  the company had  and franchised locations  respectively 
the increase in the number of franchisees resulted in increases in initial fees charged to new franchisees and royalty fees 
franchise average income was partially reduced by the opening of new stores with lower sales levels than those previously in operation 
a number of these outlets are located in smaller cities or were opened as kiosks in location having close proximity to other bob s stores 
through the period from january  to december  the company sold of its restaurants to franchisees in and in 
these stores had either low profitability or  in some cases  operating losses 
the company s historical experience has shown that franchisee administration can enhance the profitability of such stores  primarily as a result of 
lower taxation tax incentives from federal and state governments to small companies 
better knowledge of specific markets and their local customs 
lower operating expenses 
in some situations the company has provided incentives in the form of reduced royalties to franchisees for a period of time 
other income other income was r  r  and r  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and is comprised of income derived from suppliers pursuant to license as well as exclusivity agreements  from marketing fees and initial fees paid by new franchisees 
the increase through the periods is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of franchised outlets  noted above 
cost of restaurant sales cost of restaurant sales expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reduction from to is due to continuous renegotiation of purchase terms and prices with suppliers and seeking alternative sources of products 
the increase of system wide sales enabled the company to reduce the average cost of major products such as meat  french fries and ice cream  by approximately in the first two years of operation 
at the end of and during  this reduction was partially offset by an increase in costs of certain items such as bread and soft drinks primarily caused mainly  by increased taxation on these items 
restaurant payroll and other employee benefits restaurant payroll and other employee benefits expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were  and for the year ended december   and despite annual salary increases mandated by union driven agreements in and in for rio de janeiro employees and in and in for sao paulo employees  implementation of the following procedures in mid and during have resulted in a net reduction of such expenses in 
an ongoing store headcount revision  which result in a reduction in the number of assistant store managers as well as in the average number of store employees from in  to in and to in 
adoption of a new recruiting program allowing for a greater degree of flexibility in manpower usage and lower costs of recruitment and staff replacement 
reductions in employee medical costs  night shift differentials and transportation benefits 
restaurant occupancy costs and other expenses restaurant occupancy costs and other expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase is mainly due to the portion of minimum rent which is linked to the brazilian inflation rate per annum in and per annum in 
in addition  the sale of company owned stores to franchisees  noted above  included stores which prior to their sale were located in company owned properties  changed the correlation between restaurant operating costs and net operating revenues since the newly opened stores were relocated to leased properties 
depreciation and amortization the decrease from to is attributable to the completion of depreciation upon several assets leasehold improvements in june depreciation and amortization expense expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues was approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to is primarily due to increased asset values resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting in conjunction with the acquisition 
other operating expenses other operating expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and for the years ended in  and  respectively 
the slight increase from to was mainly attributable to the effect of annual inflationary adjustments of service contracts  partially offset by negotiated reductions and non renewals of certain of such contracts 
those negotiation and non renewals had a stronger effect during the first year following the acquisition  which caused the greater decrease in expenses between and selling expenses selling expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and for the years ended december   and the decrease is primarily attributable to internal cost efficiencies implemented by the company during general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included approximately r  of non recurrent charges arising primarily from i higher professional fees attributable to financing activities and regulatory filings  ii a write off of obsolete equipment and iii a partial write off of certain deferred charges 
the reduction in administrative expenses is mainly due to 
a total headcount reduction of administrative employees including senior managers and managers 
restructuring of the company s middle management  including the outsourcing of some departments in order to reduce administrative charges 
the termination of an accounting service agreement in september with a total net economy of approximately r  per month 
relocation of the company s executive and principal administrative offices to a company owned facility 
termination of a strategic consulting agreement with hardee s  which had cost the company r  during impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of  the company determined  based upon its evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows that an impairment of its goodwill existed and took a charge of r  interest income and expenses interest income and expenses expressed as a percentage of net operating revenues were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in results from an increase in the company s total indebtedness stemming from borrowings to satisfy the final payment to the company s prior owner in march of approximately r  which was funded on a short term basis by the existing credit facilities 
such indebtedness was converted into long term debt owed to a brazilian financial institution at lower interest rate by the middle of in addition  the increase in interest expenses is also attributable to higher interest rates imposed by the brazilian central bank in an effort to stabilize the real 
seasonality the company s revenues are subject to seasonality as approximately of its sales are generated during the brazilian summer months of december and january when students are on vacation and holiday shopping is widespread 
liquidity and capital resources since march   the company has funded its operating losses of r  and made acquisitions of businesses and capital improvements including store remodeling by using cash remaining at the closing of the acquisition  by borrowing funds from various sources and private placements of securities 
as of december   the company had cash on hand of r  and a working capital deficiency of r  the company s capital requirements are primarily for expansion of its retail operations 
currently  of the company s stores are in leased facilities and of the company s stores are in owned facilities 
for the year ended december  the company s ebitda was r 
during the fiscal year ended december   the company s average cost to open a store approximated r  to r  including leasehold improvements  equipment and beginning inventory  as well as expenses for store design  site selection  lease negotiation  constructions supervision and obtaining permits 
the company currently estimates that capital expenditures for fiscal will approximate r  during  the company intends to focus its efforts on expanding both the number of its franchisees and its franchised outlets  neither of which are expected to involve significant capital expenditures by the company 
see business growth strategy and franchise program 
in  the company had net cash used in operating activities of r  and had net cash used in investing activities of r  the primary use of cash for investing activities was for capital expenditures related to the company s retail store expansion 
management plans to address its immediate and future cash flow needs include focusing on a number of areas including the sale of company owned stores  reduction of expenses  including head count reductions  the expansion of its franchisee base  which would generate additional cash flows from royalties and franchise fees without significant capital expenditure  the introduction of new programs and menu expansion to meet the wants of the consumer 
in order to act on these plans and sustain current operations  the company is dependent upon the continued forbearance of its creditors  as well as additional financing 
there can be no assurance that management s plans will be realized  or that additional financing will be available to the company when needed  or at terms that are desirable 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to receive the forbearance of its creditors  or that it will locate suitable new franchisees  or desirable locations for new franchisees to open stores 
the company s ability to further reduce expenses and head count is directly impacted by its need to maintain an infrastructure to support its current and future chain of locations 
the company s ability to remarket company owned stores to franchisees  and to generate cash flows from such activities  is impacted by the ability to locate suitable buyers with the interest and capital to complete such transactions  and the time to complete such sales 
additionally  the company s ability to achieve its plans is further impacted by the instability of the economic environmental in brazil  which has a direct impact on the desire and ability of consumers to visit fast food outlets 
the company is also dependent upon the continued employment of key personnel 
these factors  among others  raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern
