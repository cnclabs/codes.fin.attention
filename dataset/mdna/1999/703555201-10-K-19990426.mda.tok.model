the credit facility is collateralized by an interest in the company s inventory  equipment  fixtures  cash and an assignment of leases

management believes that cash generated from operations and available borrowings under the company s credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital and capital expenditure needs in the foreseeable future 
year compliance the year yk will pose a unique set of challenges to those industries reliant on information technology 
as a result of methods employed by early programmers  many software applications and operational programs may be unable to distinguish the year from the year if not effectively addressed  this problem could result in the production of inaccurate data  or  in the worst cases  the inability of the systems to continue to function 
the problem also extends to many non software systems  that is operating and control systems that rely on embedded chip systems 
the company and other retailers are vulnerable to the industry s dependence on electronic point of sale  inventory control systems and other system failures such as payroll  accounting and security 
the company must also be aware of the effect of yk failures on the part of its suppliers  landlords and public or private infrastructure service providers  which include electricity  water  gas  transportation and communication 
the company s efforts in addressing the yk issues are directed by senior level management 
these efforts represent a significant commitment of time of the company s information system staff  the efforts of outside consultants and software testing applications 
management periodically reports to the board of directors with respect to the company s yk efforts 
in may  the company initiated the process of preparing its computer systems and applications for the year when the decision to replace the store point of sale equipment was made 
the store point of sale systems were replaced during the third quarter of the yk process also involves upgrading corporate hardware and software components 
management estimates the total cumulative costs will be approximately million  which includes the million already invested in the new point of sale systems 
the company s six phase approach and anticipated timing of each phase are described below 
phase inventory 
the company s hardware and software including business and operational applications and operating systems have already been inventoried 
third party businesses have already been solicited as to their preparation on this issue 
phase assessment 
the yk task force has completed the assessment of the business systems and established a priority for their repair or replacement 
the assessment process for internal non it systems and for key third party businesses has also been completed 
systems that are known to be critical or important are receiving top priority in the remediation phase 
phase strategy 
this phase involves the development of appropriate remedial strategies for both it and non it systems 
these strategies may include repairing  testing and certifying  replacing or abandonment of particular systems 
the strategy phase has been completed for all it and non it systems 
phase remediation 
the remediation phase involves the execution of the strategies chosen 
the it systems remediation is expected to be completed by the summer of the non critical systems corrections should be completed by the fall of phase test and certification 
the company expects all critical and important systems to be tested and certified during the summer of and non critical systems to be tested and certified by late fall of testing for non it systems has been initiated however  due to the company s reliance on many third party vendors  the company cannot estimate precisely when this phase will be completed 
phase contingency planning 
this phase involves addressing operational issues that may arise due to the failure of the company s or third party preparations 
the company is currently assessing such issues as the loss of communication  banking  transportation and infrastructure services 
the company estimates that all these plans will be completed by december based upon its efforts to date  the company believes that the vast majority of both its it and its non it systems will remain up and running after january  accordingly  the company does not currently anticipate that internal systems failure will result in any material adverse effect to its operations or financial condition 
at this time  the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario involves potential disruptions in areas in which the company s operations must rely on third party systems 
nonetheless  the yk problem is pervasive and complex and can potentially affect any system 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that yk compliance can be achieved without additional unanticipated expenditures and uncertainties that might affect future financial results 
inflation the effect of changing prices had minimal impact on sales and cost of sales during the past three years 
occupancy costs and certain selling  general and administrative costs have been affected by inflation during the period 
in general these increases have been modest and reflect current trends 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company considers the market risks of its variable interest rates on borrowings to not be material to its financial condition
