item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview through its medical device subsidiary  invivo research  the company offers a line of patient monitors capable of continuous measurement of multiple vital signs in the medical care environment 
prior to fiscal  the patient monitoring business was primarily focused on products for use in the mri environment 
in the mid s  the company undertook to develop a full featured  competitively priced monitor for general applications 
this effort culminated in the introduction of the millennia monitor in early fiscal the company substantially increased its sales force and marketing efforts in fiscal and to promote the entry into this new market 
this increase was the primary cause of operating expenses growing more rapidly than revenue in those years 
the improved operating results in fiscal and reflect  in part  the ongoing market penetration of the millennia product 
the company s safety and industrial instrumentation business includes monitors used to detect harmful levels of toxic and other gases in the workplace and other environments 
the company s other safety and industrial instrumentation products include a line of oxygen monitoring equipment  equipment that sets and verifies the accuracy of gas monitors  pressure sensors and non contact infrared temperature measuring devices 
results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales 
sales for fiscal increased to  compared with  for fiscal the sales increase for fiscal was primarily due to sales growth at the company s patient monitoring business 
continued strong demand for the company s next generation mri vital signs monitor  the omni trak  was largely responsible for the sales increase 
increased sales of the company s gas detection and oxygen monitoring product lines also positively affected sales in fiscal gross profit 
the gross profit margin increased in fiscal to from for fiscal the increase was largely attributable to the sales growth of our mri vital signs monitoring products  which have higher gross margins than the millennia vital signs monitor and other monitoring products 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased or  over fiscal levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales for fiscal compared with for fiscal the increase in these expenditures in aggregate was largely due to higher sales commission expenses on the higher sales volume at the patient monitoring business 
higher administrative expenses in support of the incremental sales volume at the patient monitoring business also contributed to the increase 
research and experimental expenses were  or of sales for fiscal compared to  or for fiscal a substantial amount of the total research and experimental expenses in fiscal was on behalf of the patient monitoring business as the company continued to develop additional features for its millennia vital signs monitor for specialized market areas 
other income and expense 
interest expense decreased to  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal this decrease was the result of the payoff of the outstanding balances on the company s revolving bank line of credit and term loan with the proceeds from its secondary stock offering in march  provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was compared with for fiscal the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate principally due to the benefit of a foreign sales corporation and utilization of research  experimental and other credits 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  sales 
sales for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal the sales increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to the sales growth at the patient monitoring business as sales of the millennia portable multi parameter vital signs monitor continued to increase from prior year levels 
growth in the company s safety and industrial instrumentation businesses also positively affected sales 
gross profit 
the gross profit margin increased slightly in fiscal to from in fiscal continued improvement in the gross margin of the millennia monitor was primarily due to material cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies 
in addition  higher gross margins at the gas detection and industrial instrumentation businesses offset a decline in the gross margin at the oxygen monitoring business 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased or  over fiscal levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales in fiscal compared with for fiscal the decrease in these expenditures in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales was primarily due to reduced selling  general and administrative expenses at the patient monitoring business 
this reduction occurred as many of the expenses associated with the significant expansion of the direct sales force in fiscal decreased 
research and experimental expenses remained nearly constant in absolute dollars at  or of sales in fiscal as compared to  or of sales in fiscal a substantial amount of the research and experimental expenses was on behalf of the patient monitoring business as the company continued to develop additional features for the millennia vital signs monitor for specialized market areas 
other income and expense 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase in interest expense was the result of higher outstanding balances on the company s revolving bank line of credit along with the increased mortgage on the expanded patient monitoring facility 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal remained stable at 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on its results of operations during any of the last three fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company completed the sale of  additional shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the company netted approximately  prior to the repayment of its outstanding bank borrowings of approximately  working capital at june  therefore increased to  from  at june  net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended june  compared with  provided by operations for the year ended june  this increase was largely the result of the increase in net income offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities  particularly inventories  accounts receivable  accounts payable and income taxes payable 
capital expenditures were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of costs associated with the company s new information systems and sales demonstration equipment at the company s patient safety monitoring business 
in fiscal  the company purchased of the outstanding common stock of invivo research  inc in fiscal  the company entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining of the invivo research  inc shares 
the contingent purchase price for such shares was to be paid in one or more installments 
one fifth of the price vested on january   and and two fifths vested on january  the former invivo research shareholders could make an election each year beginning in to be paid any vested payment 
the amount of any payment was based on the after tax profits of invivo research for the calendar year preceding the year that the payment was made  regardless of when the payment vested  subject to a minimum share price if certain milestones were achieved 
the company was informed in march of that the former invivo research shareholders would elect to be paid on their first installment 
based on the calendar year results for invivo research  payment was made on june   for  in march of  the former invivo research shareholders elected to be paid on the second vested installment which amounted to  the company was informed in march of that the former invivo research shareholders would elect to be paid on their final three installments 
based on calendar results for invivo research  the amount to be paid was  the company had the right to make one third of the payment in the form of its common stock 
on june  the company paid the former shareholders two of the installments in cash totaling  the remaining installment was paid in the form of the company s common stock totaling  shares

on march  the company repaid the outstandings on the line of credit and term loan 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations and proceeds from its recent stock offering will be adequate to meet its anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures throughout fiscal the company will continue to explore opportunities for the possible acquisitions of technologies or businesses  which may require the company to seek additional financing 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the statement is effective for fiscal quarters and fiscal years beginning after june  as the company does not currently have any derivative instruments for hedging activities the company believes that sfas no 
will have no impact on its consolidated financial statements 
year readiness for year many existing computer systems and related software applications use only two digits to identify a year in the date field  without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
such systems and applications could fail or create incorrect or unintended results unless corrected so that they can process data related to the year and thereafter 
the company relies on such computer systems and applications in operating and monitoring most major aspects of our business 
the company has evaluated the impact of the year issue on its business and the related expenses incurred in attempting to remedy such impact 
the year issue could affect the company in at least three different ways o the software or the chips embedded within computers and other systems used in the company s offices and manufacturing facilities could be affected 
o the software or the chips used in the products the company sells could be affected 
o third parties who do business with the company may not be prepared for the year the company determined that regardless of the year issue  replacement of existing office and other systems would provide more efficient operations and added functionality 
the company contracted with outside information consulting companies both to install new hardware and to replace its current mission critical software systems with year compliant software 
all information system upgrades and conversions are completed and fully operational 
the company is currently assessing its electronic office and manufacturing equipment to determine if such equipment is dated sensitive and will require upgrades 
if after this assessment the company determines that some of its equipment needs to be upgraded or replaced  it plans to finish the required work by october the company believes that its currently marketed products are year compliant 
some of its products are not affected because they do not contain a date field in the software 
on some previously marketed products which are not year compliant  the company will make an upgrade available to its customers to ensure year compliance 
the company cannot predict the effect of year problems on its vendors  customers and other entities with which it transacts business  or with whose products its products interact 
the company has undertaken a survey of the year readiness of these third parties and believes its key vendors are compliant 
costs through june   the company incurred approximately  of costs associated with its new information systems  of which approximately  has been capitalized 
of this  approximately  has been spent on replacing old hardware  and approximately  has been spent on replacing old software 
because the company would have replaced these systems even without the year problem  its year expenditures have not deferred other projects that the company otherwise would have undertaken 
risks the company expects to make the changes required to address the year problems for the software and embedded chips in its offices and manufacturing facilities and in the products it makes 
the company presently believes that with the new software and hardware it purchased and with any required modifications to its office and other systems which its assessment shows to be needed  the year issues is not reasonably likely to pose significant problems with respect to the company s operations or products 
however  if unforeseen difficulties arise  such modifications  conversions and replacements are not completed on time  or if or customers or suppliers systems are not modified to become year compliant  the year issue may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company cannot presently assess the likelihood that it will experience significant problems due to the unresolved year problems of third parties with which it does business 
although the company has not been put on notice that any known third party problem will not be timely resolved  it has limited information and no assurance can be made concerning the year readiness of third parties 
if third parties fail to achieve year compliance  the year issue may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the company can timely mitigate its risks related to a third party s failure to resolve its year issues 
if it fails to timely mitigate such risks  that failure may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
contingency plans the company has not attempted to quantify its most likely year worst case scenario nor has it considered any contingency plans in case the installations by its outside information consulting companies are not satisfactory for year compliance  as it believes that the installations will prove sufficient to address the year issue 
risk factors risks relating to the company s business the company is dependent on a concentrated line of products the company s future financial performance will be largely dependent on its patient monitor product line  which includes a limited number of products 
the company expects its recently introduced omni trak mri patient monitor and its millennia portable patient monitor to have a substantial impact on revenue growth 
in the mri monitoring market  the success of its omni trak is heavily dependent on the continued acceptance of mri technology as a diagnostic tool 
in the general patient monitoring market  the company s millennia monitor is heavily dependent on its ability to penetrate an already competitive market 
in addition  the recent consolidation in the medical care provider market has resulted in a number of very large purchasers of medical devices 
these large purchasers typically prefer to establish relationships with medical device manufacturers that have broad and diverse product lines 
the failure of the company s products to continue to gain market acceptance or an increase in the concentration of the medical care provider market could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company faces increased levels of competition the company has encountered and will continue to encounter significant competition in the sale of its products 
the company s general patient monitoring competitors include a number of large multinational corporations 
some of these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than the company can 
in the mri patient monitoring market  the company has enjoyed a significant first to market advantage over its competitors 
however  the company is aware that some of its competitors have introduced products designed to compete with its mri vital signs monitoring products 
in addition  as the market for mri vital signs monitoring products expands it may attract competitors with greater resources 
additionally  competition may increase if new companies enter the company s markets or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
the introduction of competitive products may result in a decrease in the company s market share and in a decrease in the prices at which the company is able to sell its products 
the company s market share could also be adversely affected by increasing concentration in the medical care provider market 
any decrease in the company s market share or decrease in the prices at which the company is able to sell its products could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company s financial results may fluctuate the company s financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period because of a variety of factors  many of which is beyond its control 
these factors include o increased competition o changes in the company s pricing policies and those of its competitors o changes in the company s operating expenses or capital expenditures o timing and market acceptance of new and upgraded product introductions by the company and its competitors o seasonal fluctuations in the demand for the company s products o introduction of alternative technologies by the company and its competitors o effect of potential acquisitions o other general economic factors fluctuations caused by these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company is subject to a significant risk of new laws related to health care changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a significant effect on the company s costs of doing business and the amount of reimbursement the company receives from both government and third party payors 
in addition  economic forces  regulatory influences and political initiatives are subjecting the health care industry to fundamental changes 
health care reform proposals have been formulated by the current administration and by members of congress 
federal  state and local government representatives are likely to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methods 
the company expects ongoing public debate on these issues 
any of these efforts or reforms could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s business is subject to technological change and introduction of new products technological change  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements characterize the markets for the company s products 
many of the company s products and products under development are technologically innovative  and therefore require significant planning  design  development and testing 
these activities require the company to make significant capital commitments and investments 
in addition  industry standards may change on short notice and new products and technologies may render existing products and technologies uncompetitive 
additionally  the products that the company is currently developing  and those that the company develops in the future  may not be technologically feasible or accepted by the marketplace or they may not be completed in an acceptable time frame 
any increased capital investments or loss in sales due to technological change could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company currently is involved in a legal proceeding the company s medical device subsidiary  invivo research  was one of two third party defendants named in a lawsuit in june of by southern nevada surgical center and surgex southern nevada  inc in nevada state district court 
the underlying action in this matter stemmed from an incident involving a surgical patient undergoing a procedure at the southern nevada surgical center 
the patient suffered a serious permanent brain injury 
a lawsuit was filed on behalf of the patient against the surgical center and the anesthesiologist who monitored the patient 
a substantial settlement was made to the patient by the defendants in that action 
southern nevada surgical center snsc and surgex were seeking indemnity and contribution of approximately million from the manufacturer of the anesthetic gas machine and invivo research  which manufactured the vital signs monitor used in this procedure 
snsc and surgex alleged that both the anesthetic gas machine and the vital signs monitor were defective 
on august   the nevada district court granted the company s motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute 
the order granted dismissal of the snsc and surgex contribution claims  without prejudice  based upon nevada law which provides that an action must be brought to trial within five years of the date of the filing of the original action 
in april of  the plaintiff s insurer  cna  filed an action with identical causes in the same nevada state court 
this second action was removed by the company to federal court and is presently pending 
any judgment against the company that exceeds the amount that its insurer is required to pay could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company faces product liability and product recall risks with respect to all of its products  and particularly its medical devices  the company faces the risk of potentially large product liability claims 
the malfunction or misuse of its products could potentially result in serious harm to a patient 
in addition  the company may be required to indemnify its distributors and customers for similar claims made against them 
claims could be made against the company even if its products did not contribute to the injury that was sustained 
frequently  the company s products are used with products developed by other manufacturers 
even if its products are not the cause of the injury  the company may not be able to prove that some other product malfunction or human error caused a claimant s injury 
the company has had product liability claims made against it in the past and may have further claims made against it in the future 
while the company is insured for certain product liability claims  not all claims will be covered and the level of its insurance may not be sufficient to protect us from the full amount of a successful claim 
in addition  the company may not be able to obtain adequate amounts of insurance at an acceptable cost 
claims made against the company that are not insured  or that exceed the amount of the company s coverage  could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
similarly  the company s products are subject to the potential of being recalled by government agencies for actual or potential deficiencies or problems 
any such recall would likely be expensive and would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company faces increased risks of international operations international sales have accounted for over of the company s sales for each of the past three years and will likely increase over time 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the following o fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the demand for products and services the company provides in foreign markets o adverse changes in local economic conditions  such as those recently occurring in asian and south american countries  could depress the demand for the company s products o agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country s legal system o foreign customers may have longer payment cycles o foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax the company s foreign income  impose tariffs  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade o us export licenses may be difficult to obtain o the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is that of currency risk 
during the year ended june   of the company s total sales came from non united states domiciled customers 
the company requires payment in united states us currency 
if these customers currency devalues against the us dollar  the customers could potentially encounter difficulty in making the us dollar denominated payments
