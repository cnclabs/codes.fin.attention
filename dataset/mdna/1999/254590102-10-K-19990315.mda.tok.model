year date conversion the company is in the process of identifying  assessing and developing contingency plans to address problems that may arise as a result of the inability of the company s computers  or those of its material vendors and customers  to properly recognize and manipulate dates in the year beginning with the first two digits instead of in its evaluation process  the company considers a computer to be year compliant if a any valid date  both before and after december  including february   does not cause an interruption in the desired operation  and b i the computer will correctly sort  calculate and compare all dates  and ii if the first two digits of the date are implicit  ie  the date is represented by only digits  eg  for and for  the computer will interpret the dates consistently and with the result that always means  and always means 
the company s evaluation of the year problem includes the assessment of its computer systems and its equipment and other systems that are controlled or monitored by computers or embedded computer chips  and the ability of its critical vendors and customers to ensure timely delivery of goods and services and payment of invoices  respectively 
in march  the company installed a fully integrated computer system that is year compliant 
the software calculates the date incrementally from a fixed past date  using a five byte data field compared to the standard two byte data field 
for example  from the date of march   the software can calculate incrementally  days from that fixed date  approximately until the year each software module has been examined to confirm that it uses the five byte date field in all date sorts  calculations and comparisons 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed a full test of the software by advancing the date past including february  and ran each software module with test data to confirm empirically that the system accommodates the century rollover 
the test confirmed that all mission critical modules are yk compliant 
several modules contained two or eight character date fields that are not used in calculations  and are not adversely effected by the date change 
one module contains a two character date field that is used in calculations and must be fixed 
the company expects to fix all the modules and fully retest the system by june  the company has also undertaken to test the year compatibility of each desktop and portable computer and each piece of equipment containing an embedded computer chip  by confirming empirically that each computer and its associated software and each piece of equipment will function properly with dates occurring both before and after the tests of personal computers is expected to be completed by june  the company s business could be materially affected if various material vendors and customers are not themselves year compliant 
in particular  if the company is unable to obtain necessary supplies  services or critical machine parts  its operations could suffer 
if its major customers are unable to make payments or continue purchases  the company s cash flow could suffer 
the inability of major utilities to supply power or telephone service after the rollover could also adversely affect the company s operations 
in order to assess and address such problems  the company is in the process of surveying all its material vendors and customers to determine their likely state of year compliance at the rollover 
the survey is expected to be completed by june  although the company is currently unaware of any material vendor or customer who will not be year compliant  it has and will continue to develop contingency plans in the event any material vendors or customers are unable in the year to fulfill their supply or payment obligations to the company 
in particular  the company has taken steps to ensure that no significant vendor is a sole source or limited source supplier  by arranging multiple sources for all critical resources  by warehousing or stocking a limited supply of critical materials and parts  and by developing the ability to fabricate critical machine parts in an in house facility 
the company is exploring with its insurer whether present policies provide any coverage for potential business losses and liability to third parties resulting from the company s failure or inability to be year compliant due to factors not under its control  and if not  whether such policies are available 
the company has established a year compliance committee to assess the impact of the year problem on the company s business and to ensure its year compliance 
the committee is co chaired by the vice president for legal affairs and human resource policy and the management information systems manager  and is comprised of representatives from all major departments and all facilities within the company 
management has committed all resources  both financial and personnel  reasonably necessary to achieve year compliance and or implement its contingency plans for events outside its control 
the company does not believe that the costs it has incurred to date or currently expects to incur in future periods are or will be material  in the aggregate  primarily because these costs have been and will be incurred in connection with projects begun before  and or budgeted without regard to  the company s year compliance efforts 
although the company believes it will be year compliant no later than june   there can be no assurance that the company will successfully identify all systems  vendors or customers which are not year compliant  that the company will not have to increase significantly its expenditures relating to any such non compliance  or that its business will not be materially adversely affected by any such non compliance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company finances the purchase of production equipment and other capital expenditures through long term debt and or capital leases 
the stated or implicit interest rates on such obligations are generally fixed 
in those instances where rates are variable  the company will generally fix the rate through an interest rate swap agreement 
accordingly  the company does not believe it is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
the company does not have any sales  purchases  assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and as such is not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk
