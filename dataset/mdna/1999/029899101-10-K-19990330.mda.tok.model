item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation unless specifically noted  the following discussion and analysis provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets 
there are no material differences between the consolidated operations and assets of awr and the operations and assets of scw 
forward looking information certain matters discussed in this report including the documents incorporated herein by reference are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as the company or registrant believes  anticipates  expects or words of similar import 
similarly  statements that describe the company s future plans  objectives  estimates or goals are also forward looking statements 
such statements address future events and conditions concerning capital expenditures  earnings  litigation  rates  water quality and other regulatory matters  adequacy of water supplies  liquidity and capital resources  opportunities related to operations of municipally owned water systems and accounting matters 
actual results in each case could differ materially from those currently anticipated in such statements  by reason of factors such as utility restructuring  including ongoing local  state and federal activities  future economic conditions  including changes in customer demand  future climatic conditions  legislative  regulatory and other circumstances affecting anticipated revenues and costs  and abilities of other companies to remain or become year ready 
results of operations years ended december  and basic earnings per common share in increased by to per share as compared to per share for the comparable period last year 
although wet weather significantly impacted revenues in  lower supply costs and modest increases in other operating expenses partially offset the decline in revenues 
water operating revenues decreased by in to million from the million reported in water sales volumes in were lower than due to extremely wet weather during the first half of the decrease in sales was partially offset by rate increases effective during electric operating revenues of million were higher in as compared to due to the impact of a general rate increase effective january as well as a increase in kilowatt hour sales 
purchased water costs decreased in to million as compared to million in due to a decrease in volumes purchased and refunds received from scw s wholesale water supplier during of approximately million 
refunds of million were received in costs of power purchased for pumping decreased by to million in chiefly as the result of the reduced energy costs from scw s suppliers 
costs of power purchased for resale in decreased by to million from the million recorded in due to reduced costs from scw s energy providers  which partially offset the effects of increased kilowatt hour sales volumes recorded during the year 
groundwater production assessments increased to million in from million in due to the increased amounts of pumped water in scw s resource mix as well as additional assessments associated with increased pumping in scw s metropolitan and orange county customer service areas 
a positive entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects recovery of previously under collected supply costs 
conversely  a negative entry for the provision for supply cost balancing accounts reflects an under collection of previously incurred supply costs 
recovery of previously under collected supply costs was lower in than due to the expiration in january of a surcharge designed to recover those costs 
it is anticipated that new rates  effective january  will increase collection of these under collected costs 
the balancing account mechanism insulates earnings from changes in the unit cost of supply costs which are outside of the immediate control of registrant 
however  the balancing account is not designed to insulate earnings against changes in supply mix  as occurred during the first eight months of other operating expenses increased by from the million recorded in due to employee time charged to this category 
reversals in of costs associated with recovery of water quality expenditures through the cpuc s memorandum account mechanism also contributed to the increase 
there were no such reversals of equal magnitude in administrative and general expenses decreased slightly by to million in from the million recorded in the decrease is due to stability in costs associated with health insurance  post retirement medical benefits  pension and k plan costs and to a reduction of time charge by employees to this category 
in  maintenance expense remained at approximately the million level recorded in due principally to the wet weather conditions during the first part of the year that hampered planned maintenance activity 
depreciation expense in increased by to million reflecting the effects of recording approximately million in net plant additions during  depreciation on which began in in addition  amortization of start up and organizational costs associated with the formation of awr is reflected in there were no similar amortization costs in taxes on income increased by approximately to million in as compared to the million in due to a increase in operating income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate 
property and other taxes decreased by in to million due primarily to reduced franchise tax payments directly attributable to reduced revenues 
other income increased by in due principally to the flow through of tax benefits related to refinancing of long term debt which was partially offset by an increase in reserves against costs associated with scw s non regulated activities 
interest expense increased by to million primarily due to increased short term bank borrowing and the issuance of million in long term debt in march years ended december  and basic earnings per common share in decreased by to per share as compared to per share for the comparable period in  directly attributable to significantly increased supply costs during the first eight months of water operating revenues increased by in to million from the million reported in although water sales volumes were higher in  in scw began recovery of previously incurred supply costs  in accordance with rules of the cpuc 
in  recovery of these costs was completed in several customer service areas and rates were accordingly reduced  partially offsetting rate increases effective during in other customer service areas 
electric operating revenues of million were higher in as compared to due to the impact of a general rate increase effective january as well as a increase in kilowatt hour sales 
purchased water costs remained relatively the same at million in as compared to million in  despite a increase in volumes purchased  due to refunds received from scw s wholesale water supplier during of approximately million  which reduced recorded purchased water costs 
there were no such refunds received during costs of power purchased for pumping decreased by to million in  chiefly as the result of the reduced amounts of water produced from pumped sources in scw s resource mix 
during  scw had several wells out of service due to water quality issues which significantly affected its ability to fully utilize its groundwater resources 
costs of power purchased for resale in decreased by to million from the million recorded in due to reduced costs from scw s energy provider which partially offset the effects of increased kilowatt hour sales volumes recorded during the year 
groundwater production assessments increased to million in from million in due to additional assessments associated with increased pumping in scw s san gabriel valley and san dimas customer service areas 
the positive entry for supply cost balancing accounts for is a result of approval by the cpuc of rate increases sufficient to recover previously under collected purchased supply costs  as well as refunds received during from wholesale suppliers 
the balancing account mechanism insulates earnings from changes in the unit costs of supply costs which are outside of the immediate control of scw 
however  the balancing account is not designed to insulate earnings against changes in supply mix  as occurred during the first eight months of administrative and general expenses increased by to million in from the million recorded in this increase reflects higher labor costs 
in addition  during scw incurred costs for consulting on water quality litigation for which there was no corresponding amount in in  maintenance expense decreased by to million from million recorded in due principally to increased emphasis being placed on scw s meter replacement and capital improvement program which partially offset increased maintenance on scw s water supply sources 
depreciation expense in increased by to million reflecting the effects of recording approximately million in net plant additions during  on which depreciation began in taxes on income decreased by approximately to million in as compared to the million in as a result of lower pre tax income 
other taxes increased by in to million due primarily to increased property taxes resulting from higher valuation assessments in other income increased by in due principally to an increase in billings to the city of folsom for the lease of a portion of scw s water rights in the american river 
interest expense decreased by to million primarily due to reduced short term bank borrowing and the lower borrowing rates experienced during liquidity and capital resources awr funds its operating expenses  dividends on its outstanding common and preferred shares and makes its mandatory sinking fund payments principally through dividends from scw 
in december  awr filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec for issuance  from time to time  of up to million in common shares  preferred shares and or debt securities 
the proceeds will be used primarily for investment in its subsidiaries 
scw funds the majority of its operating expenses  interest payments on its debt and dividends on its outstanding common shares through internal sources 
scw continues to rely on external sources  including short term bank borrowing  contributions in aid of construction  advances for construction and install and convey advances  to fund the majority of its construction expenditures 
because of the seasonal nature of its water and electric operations  scw utilizes its short term borrowing capacity to finance current operating expenses 
the aggregate short term borrowing capacity available to scw under its three bank lines of credit was million as of december  of which a total of million was outstanding 
scw routinely employs short term bank borrowing as an interim financing source prior to executing either a long term debt or equity issue 
scw issued long term debt totaling million in march the funds were used initially to repay short term bank borrowings  after which construction expenditures were funded 
in december  scw redeemed  at a premium  the entire million outstanding of its notes 
these notes were refinanced in january in december  scw filed a registration statement with the sec for issuance  from time to time  of up to million in long term debt with the net proceeds being used to repay short term bank borrowings and fund construction needs 
in january  scw issued million of long term debt pursuant to this registration statement  all of which was used to reduce bank borrowing 
registrant has no derivative financial instruments  financial instruments with significant off balance sheet risks or financial instruments with concentrations of credit risk 
construction program scw s construction program is designed to ensure its customers high quality service 
a program for water pipeline replacement is on going throughout the customer service areas  based on priority of leaks detected  fire protection enhancements and reflection of the underlying replacement schedule 
in addition  general upgrades in scw s water supply facilities are anticipated to be on going 
scw s board of directors has approved anticipated net capital expenditures of million in neither awr nor asus have material capital requirements 
regulatory matters scw is subject to regulation by the cpuc  which has broad powers with respect to service and facilities  rates  classifications of accounts  valuation of properties  the purchase  disposition and mortgaging of properties necessary or useful in rendering public utility service  the issuance of securities  the granting of certificates of convenience and necessity as to the extension of services and facilities and various other matters 
awr and asus are not directly regulated by the cpuc 
the cpuc does  however  regulate certain transaction between scw and its unregulated affiliates 
the customer service areas of scw are grouped into water districts and one electric district for ratemaking purposes 
water rates vary among the ratemaking districts due to differences in operating conditions and costs 
scw monitors operations on a regional basis in each of these districts so that applications for rate changes may be filed  when warranted 
under the cpuc s practices  rates may be increased by three methods general rate case increases grc s  offsets for certain expense increases and advice letter filings related to certain plant additions 
grc s are typically for three year periods  which include step increases for the second and third year 
rates are based on projected expenses and capital costs 
grc s have a typical regulatory lag of one year 
offset rate increases typically have a two to four month regulatory lag 
the following table lists information on estimated annual rate changes during  and supply balancing general cost account and step advice year offset amortization increases letters total amounts are in s new water rates were implemented in three of scw s customer service areas in january  to recover costs associated with capital projects in those areas 
step increases in rates were effective in april in barstow and in may in santa maria 
increased rates for six additional water ratemaking districts and recovery of costs associated with scw s general office functions were effective january  applications to increase water rates were filed for four water ratemaking districts in february the new rates  if authorized in total or in part by the cpuc  would be effective january  scw has filed an application with the cpuc to combine tariff schedules into regional rates for the customer service areas that make up scw s region iii 
a final decision from the cpuc is anticipated by the fourth quarter of hearings were held before the cpuc in november on scw s filing seeking recovery through rates of million in costs associated with its participation in the coastal aqueduct extension of the state water project the project 
in february  the administrative law judge assigned to the application issued his proposed decision which denied recovery of scw s costs in the project 
scw is continuing to pursue alternative forms of recovery of its investment in the project including sale of its interests therein to other participants in the project 
a final order from the cpuc is anticipated in the second quarter of see note of the notes to financial statements in part ii  item environmental matters amendments to federal safe drinking water act on august   amendments the sdwa amendments to the safe drinking water act the sdwa were signed into law 
the sdwa revised the amendments to the sdwa with a new process for selecting and regulating contaminants 
the u 
s 
environmental protection agency epa can only regulate contaminants that may have adverse health effects  are known or likely to occur at levels of public health concern  and the regulation of which will provide a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction 
the epa has published a list of contaminants for possible regulation and must update that list every five years 
in addition  every five years  the epa must select at least five contaminants on that list and determine whether to regulate them 
the new law allows the epa to bypass the selection process and adopt interim regulations for contaminants in order to address urgent health threats 
current regulations  however  remain in place and are not subject to the new standard setting provisions 
the dohs  acting on behalf of the epa  administers the epa s program in california 
the sdwa amendments allow the epa for the first time to base primary drinking water regulations on risk assessment and cost benefit considerations and on minimizing overall risk 
the epa must base regulations on best available  peer reviewed science and data from best available methods 
for proposed regulations that involve the setting of maximum contaminant levels mcl s  the epa must use  and seek public comment on  an analysis of quantifiable and non quantifiable risk reduction benefits and cost for each such mcl 
scw currently tests its wells and water systems according to requirements listed in the sdwa 
water from wells found to contain levels of contaminants above the established mcls is treated before it is delivered to customers 
since the sdwa became effective  scw has experienced increased operating costs for testing to determine the levels  if any  of the constituents in scw s sources of supply and additional expense to lower the level of any contaminants in order to meet the mcl standards 
such costs and the costs of controlling any other contaminants may cause scw to experience additional capital costs as well as increased operating costs 
registrant is currently unable to predict the ultimate impact that the sdwa amendments might have on its financial position or its results of operation 
the cpuc ratemaking process provides scw with the opportunity to recover prudently incurred capital and operating costs associated with water quality 
management believes that such incurred costs will be authorized for recovery by the cpuc 
proposed enhanced surface water treatment rule on july   the epa proposed an enhanced surface water treatment rule eswtr which would require increased surface water treatment to decrease the risk of microbial contamination 
the epa has proposed several versions of the eswtr for promulgation 
the version selected for promulgation will be determined based on data collected by certain water suppliers and forwarded to the epa pursuant to epa s information collection rule  which requires such water suppliers to monitor microbial and other contaminants in their water supplies and to conduct certain tests in respect of such contaminants 
the epa has adopted an interim eswtr applicable only to systems serving greater than  persons 
the long term eswtr  in any of the forms currently proposed  would apply to each of scw s five surface water treatment plants and is expected to be promulgated by november however  because it is impossible to predict the version of the eswtr that will be promulgated  registrant is unable to predict what additional costs  if any  will be incurred to comply with the eswtr 
regulation of disinfection disinfection by products registrant is also subject to the new regulations concerning disinfection disinfection by products dbps  stage i of which regulations were effective in november  with full compliance required by stage i requires reduction of tri halomethane contaminants from micrograms per liter to micrograms per liter 
two of scw s systems are immediately impacted by this rule 
scw implemented modifications to the treatment process in its bay point and cordova systems 
it is anticipated that both systems will be in full compliance by the epa must adopt stage ii rules pertaining to dbps  according to a negotiated schedule by the epa is not allowed to use the new cost benefit analysis provided for in the sdwa amendments for establishing the stage ii rules applicable to dbps but may utilize the regulatory negotiating process provided for in the sdwa amendments to develop the stage ii rule 
the final rule is expected by ground water rule by august  the epa is scheduled to propose regulations requiring disinfection of certain groundwater systems and provide guidance on determining which systems must provide disinfection facilities 
the epa may utilize the cost benefit analysis provided in the sdwa amendments to establish such regulations 
it is anticipated that the regulations will apply to several of scw s systems using groundwater supplies 
while no assurance can be given as to the nature and cost of any additional compliance measures  if any  registrant does not believe that such regulations will impose significant compliance costs  since scw already currently engages in disinfection of its groundwater systems 
regulation of radon and arsenic registrant will be subject to new regulations regarding radon and arsenic 
epa must propose an arsenic rule by january  and adopt a rule one year later 
the epa originally had days after enactment of the sdwa amendments to develop a plan to study ways to reduce arsenic health risk uncertainties and was authorized to enter into cooperative agreements to carry out the study 
it is anticipated that the completed study will be available for review in depending on the mcl eventually established for arsenic  compliance could cause registrant to implement costly well head treatment remedies such as ion exchange or  alternatively  to purchase additional and more expensive water supplies already in compliance  for blending with well sources 
the epa has withdrawn its proposed radon rule and has arranged for the national academy of sciences to conduct a risk assessment and a study of risk reduction benefits associated with various mitigation measures 
the national academy of sciences has completed its study and has agreed with much of epa s original findings but has slightly reduced the ingestion risk initially assumed by epa 
the epa is expected to establish an mcl based on the findings of the national academy of sciences risk assessment report and to set an alternative mcl based on potential mitigation measures for overall radon reduction by august although registrant is unable to predict the standard for radon  registrant itself is currently conducting studies to determine the best treatment for affected wells 
voluntary efforts to exceed surface water treatment standards scw is a voluntary member of the epa s partnership for safe water  a national program designed to further protect the public from diseases caused by cryptosporidium and other microscopic organisms 
as a volunteer in the program  scw commits to exceed current regulations governing surface water treatment to ensure that its surface treatment facilities are performing as efficiently as possible 
fluoridation of water supplies registrant is subject to state of california assembly bill which requires fluoridation of water supplies for public water systems serving more than  service connections 
although the bill requires affected systems to install treatment facilities only when public funds have been made available to cover capital and operating costs  the bill requires the cpuc to authorize cost recovery through rates should public funds for operation of the facilities  once installed  become unavailable in future years 
matters relating to arden cordova system in january   scw was notified that ammonium perchlorate in amounts above the state determined action level had been detected in three of its wells serving its arden cordova system 
aerojet general corporation has  in the past  used ammonium perchlorate in their processing as an oxidizer of rocket fuels 
scw took the three wells detected with ammonium perchlorate out of service at that time 
although neither the epa nor the dohs has established a drinking water standard for ammonium perchlorate  dohs has established an action level of parts per billion ppb which required scw to notify customers in its arden cordova customer service area of detection of ammonium perchlorate in amounts in excess of this action level 
in april   scw found ammonium perchlorate in three additional wells and  at that time  removed those wells from service until it was determined that the levels were below the state determined action level 
those wells were returned to service 
scw periodically monitors of these wells to determine that levels of perchlorate are below the action level currently in effect 
in february  scw was informed that a substance called nitrosodimethylemine ndma had been detected in amounts in excess of the epa reference dosage for health risks in three of its wells in its arden cordova system 
each of the wells has been removed from service 
ndma is an additional by product from the production of rocket fuel and it is believed that such contamination is related to the activities of aerojet general corporation 
aerojet general corporation has reimbursed scw for constructing a pipeline to interconnect with the city of folsom water system to provide an alternative source s of water supply in scw s arden cordova customer service area as well as reimburse scw for costs associated with the drilling and equipping of two new wells 
scw and aerojet general corporation are in negotiations on other matters related to procedures to address cleanup of the contaminated wells  costs associated with the cleanup  costs associated with increased costs of purchased water as compared to pumped sources and costs associated with developing new sources of groundwater supply 
registrant is unable to predict when the negotiations will be completed or the likely outcome of such negotiations 
matters relating to culver city system the compound  methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  has been detected in the charnock basin  located in the city of santa monica and within scw s culver city customer service area 
mtbe is an oxygenate used in reformulated fuels 
at the request of the regional water quality control board  the city of santa monica and the california environmental protection agency  scw removed two of its wells in the culver city system from service in october  to help in efforts to avoid further spread of the mtbe contamination plume 
neither of these wells has been found to be contaminated with mtbe 
scw is purchasing water from the mwd at an increased cost to replace the water supply formerly pumped from the two wells removed from service 
several studies are under way to determine the possible sources and causes of the mtbe contamination 
the federal epa is pursuing an enforcement effort to reach a settlement with the potentially responsible parties on matters relating to the cleanup of the contamination 
registrant is unable to predict the outcome of the epa s enforcement efforts 
pursuant to an agreement with scw  two of the potentially responsible parties have reimbursed scw s legal and consulting costs related to this matter as well as for increased costs incurred by scw in purchasing replacement water 
scw and such parties have negotiated a month to month extension of this agreement which is anticipated to remain effective until the underlying groundwater basin contamination is remediated 
bear valley electric scw has been  in conjunction with the southern california edison unit of edison international  planning to upgrade transmission facilities to kv the kv project in order to meet increased energy and demand requirements 
the kv project is subject to an environmental impact report eir and delays in approval of the eir may impact service in scw s bear valley electric customer service area 
scw has  however  taken other measures  including some measures that will be enacted on an emergency basis  to meet load growth in order mitigate delays in approval of the eir 
water supply during  the company supplied a total of  acre feet of water 
of this amount  approximately came from pumped sources and was purchased from others  principally the mwd 
the remaining amount was supplied by the bureau of reclamation the bureau under a no cost contract 
during  the company produced  acre feet of water  of which came from pumped sources  was purchased and the remainder was supplied by the bureau 
the mwd is a water district organized under the laws of the state of california for the purpose of delivering imported water to areas within its jurisdiction 
the company has connections for the water distribution facilities of mwd and other municipal water agencies 
mwd imports water from two principal sources the colorado river and the state water project swp 
available water supplies from the colorado river and the swp have historically been sufficient to meet most of mwd s requirements and mwd s supplies from these sources are anticipated to remain adequate through however  mwd has taken a number of steps to secure additional storage capacity and increase available water supplies  including effecting transfers of water rights from other sources 
the water year  which ended september  was labeled a wet one by the california department of water resources 
the outlook for water supply in remains favorable 
in those customer services areas of scw which pump groundwater  overall groundwater conditions remain at adequate levels 
however  certain of scw s groundwater supplies have been affected to varying degrees by various forms of contamination which  in some cases  has caused increased reliance on purchased water in its resource mix 
business segments awr currently has two principal business units water service and electric distribution utility operations conducted through its scw subsidiary  and its non regulated activities through its asus subsidiary 
all activities of registrant currently are geographically located within the state of california  except for one contract providing customer service and billing services to a utility located in the state of arizona 
scw is a regulated utility which operates both water and electric systems 
on a stand alone basis  awr has no material assets other than its investments in its subsidiaries 
scw terminated its golden state water company joint venture effective december  year issue registrant continues to evaluate its exposure to the year yk problem that arises from the fact that many existing computer systems may contain date sensitive embedded technology that uses only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
based on the assumption that the first two digits of the date field are always  such systems may misinterpret dates after december  because registrant is dependent upon the proper functioning of these computer systems and other equipment containing date sensitive technology  a failure of these systems could have a material and adverse affect on registrant resulting in business interruption or shutdown  financial loss  regulatory citations and legal liability 
registrant has been actively assessing its yk readiness since early and has inventoried its significant computer hardware and software programs 
since registrant is dependent upon its management information and customer service systems  upgrades to these systems have been a priority 
registrant has  since  been in the process of replacing and or upgrading as necessary its core business information and operating systems with newer technologies  all of which are intended to be yk ready 
all major upgrades to these systems are completed and were operational at year end costs associated with the implementation and upgrade of major management information and customer service software systems  as well as upgrades to mainframe hardware systems  have been approved by the cpuc and are being recovered through rates 
in addition to work being done on its internal systems  registrant has sought compliance certification from external vendors and service providers 
testing on registrant s interface with financial and other institutions with which it does business is being conducted to ensure yk readiness 
in order to more fully address yk readiness of its field equipment  major vendors and service providers  registrant engaged the services of a nationally recognized business consulting firm and has completed its written plan to address the yk issue 
registrant has established a year task force consisting of senior management and operating personnel which will complete the inventory of computer systems and other devices with embedded technology  as well as other considerations potentially not revealed in preliminary internal analyses 
registrant s general process for addressing the yk issue is i to inventory all systems that may have a potential yk impact  ii to determine the materiality of these non yk ready systems  iii to replace and test  correct and test  or prepare for the failure of material items that have been determined to be non yk ready  and iv to prepare contingency plans 
some  less critical systems may not be fully yk ready  but are not anticipated to materially affect registrant s operations 
registrant is significantly dependent on third party suppliers  such as energy and telecommunication companies and wholesale water suppliers 
in order to conduct its business  registrant has initiated due diligence with certain of its major service providers to address their yk readiness 
in the event that such suppliers might be adversely affected by yk  registrant is preparing its contingency plan which will likely include  among other things  increased staffing during critical periods  manual back up for automated systems and the use of electric generators capable of providing power during a black out 
registrant does not have  and may never fully have  sufficient information about the yk exposure or remediation plans of these third parties to adequately predict the risks posed by them to registrant 
if the third parties have yk problems that are not remedied  resulting problems could include loss of utility services and disruption of water supplies 
to date  there have been no significant costs associated with yk readiness that have not been approved by the cpuc for recovery through rates 
registrant estimates that it may incur up to  in costs depending on the results of on going tests  to make critical systems yk ready 
registrant believes that the future costs  which are prudently incurred  will also be allowed for recovery through rates 
the cpuc has notified all utilities under its jurisdiction  including scw  that it will review their yk preparations 
risk factor summary this report written in plain english summarizes certain risks of our business that may affect our future financial results 
we also periodically file with the securities and exchange commission documents that include more information on these risks 
it is important for investors to read these documents 
litigation scw has recently been sued in nine water quality related lawsuits a suit filed on april  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a federal superfund site a suit filed on november  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water  few of our systems are located in the geographical area covered by this suit a suit filed on january  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water in scw s arden cordova service area a suit filed on february  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed on february  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site a suit filed in april alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the delivery of contaminated water in scw s arden cordova service area three suits filed on july  alleging personal injury and property damage as a result of the sale of water from wells located in an area of the san gabriel valley that has been designated a superfund site in march  the cpuc issued an order instituting investigation the oii as a result of these types of suits being filed against water utilities in california 
the cpuc is seeking to determine whether existing standards and policies regarding drinking water quality adequately protect the public health whether water utilities are following existing standards the lawsuits have been stayed pending the outcome of the oii and a hearing before the first district court of appeal on april  we anticipate that the cpuc will issue a decision in the oii on or about june we are unable to predict the nature of the cpuc s final decision or the outcome of the lawsuits 
an adverse outcome in this type of litigation is  however  likely to be material 
the cpuc has authorized a memorandum account for legal expenses incurred by water utilities  including scw  in the water quality lawsuits 
under the memorandum account procedure  scw may recover litigation costs from ratepayers to the extent authorized by the cpuc 
the cpuc has not yet authorized scw to recover any of its litigation costs 
environmental regulation we are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations that will result in increasing capital and operating costs 
these regulations include the amendments to the safe drinking water act that require increased testing and treatment of water to reduce specified contaminants to minimum containment levels interim regulations expected to be adopted before the end of requiring increased surface water treatment to decrease the risk of microbial contamination  these regulations will affect scw s five surface water treatment plants additional regulation of disinfection disinfection byproducts expected to be adopted before the end of  these regulations will potentially affect two of scw s systems additional regulations expected to be adopted before the end of requiring disinfection of certain groundwater systems  these regulations will potentially impact several of scw s systems using groundwater supplies potential regulation of radon and arsenic new california requirements to fluoridate public water systems serving over  customers we may be able to recover costs incurred to comply with these regulations through the ratemaking process for our regulated systems 
we may also be able to recover certain of these costs under our contractual arrangements with municipalities 
in certain circumstances  we may recover costs from parties responsible or potentially responsible for contamination 
rates and regulation scw is subject to regulation by the cpuc 
awr and asus are not directly subject to cpuc regulation 
the cpuc may  however  regulate transactions between scw and awr  including the manner in which overhead costs are allocated between scw and awr and the pricing of services rendered by scw to awr 
scw s revenues depend substantially on the rates that it is permitted to charge its customers 
scw may increase rates in three ways by filing for a general rate increase by filing for recovery of certain expenses by filing an advice letter for certain plant additions  thereby increasing rate base in addition  scw recovers certain supply costs through a balancing account mechanism 
supply costs include the cost of purchased water and power and groundwater production assessments 
the balancing account mechanism is intended to insulate scw s earnings from changes in supply costs that are beyond scw s control 
the balancing account is not  however  designed to insulate scw s earnings against changes in supply mix 
as a result  scw may not recover increased costs due to increased use of purchased water through the balancing account mechanism 
in addition  balancing account adjustments  if authorized by the cpuc  may result in either increases or decreases in revenues attributable to supply costs incurred in prior periods  depending upon whether there has been an undercollection or overcollection of supply costs 
there are also a number of matters pending before the cpuc that may affect our future financial results 
these matters include applications filed by scw to increase rates in four of its rate making jurisdictions  a final decision is not expected until near year end an application filed to consolidate the rate making jurisdictions located in scw s region iii area into a single tariff an application filed by scw for permission to recover certain costs of scw s participation in the coastal aqueduct extension of the state water project  the alj assigned to this matter has issued a proposed decision that denies recovery of our costs for participation in the project  the final order could differ uphold the alj s decision or differ materially from his proposed decision the oii new guidelines under consideration by the cpuc for the acquisition and merger of water utilities and for privatization transactions adequacy of water supplies the adequacy of water supplies varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors  including rainfall the amount of water stored in reservoirs the amount used by our customers and others water quality  and legal limitations on use 
as a result of heavier than normal rainfall in the winter of  most of california s reservoirs are near capacity and the outlook for water supply in the near term is generally favorable 
population growth and increases in the amount of water used have  however  increased limitations on use to prevent overdrafting of groundwater basins 
the import of water from the colorado river  one of our important sources of supply  is expected to decrease in future years due to the requirements of the central arizona project 
we also have in recent years taken wells out of service due to water quality problems 
water shortages affect us in several ways they adversely affect supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water they adversely affect operating costs they may result in an increase in capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supplies and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water we may be able to recover increased operating and construction costs for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process 
we may also be able to recover certain of these costs under the terms of our contractual agreements with municipalities 
in certain circumstances  we may recover these costs from third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
we are currently in negotiations with aerojet general corporation regarding costs associated with the cleanup of the groundwater supply for our arden cordova system and for the increased costs of purchasing water and developing new sources of groundwater supply 
we are also negotiating with two potentially responsible parties on matters relating to the clean up and purchase of replacement water in the charnock basin located in the cities of santa monica and culver city 
these two potentially responsible parties have previously reimbursed us for replacement water and certain legal and consulting expenses 
the charnock basin is in scw s service territory 
water quality scw has detected ammonium perchlorate and nitrosodimethylemine in amounts in excess of certain state or federal limits in wells serving its arden cordova system 
both substances are byproducts from the production of rocket fuel 
scw has taken wells out of service  increased monitoring of other wells and drilled new wells in the area 
in addition  scw is constructing a new pipeline to the city of folsom s water system in order to obtain an alternative source of supply for its arden cordova customers 
aerojet general corporation has reimbursed scw for certain of these costs 
negotiations with aerojet general corporation are continuing with respect to other costs 
the compound methyl tertiary butyl ether has been detected in the charnock basin 
scw has taken two wells out of service in this area and is purchasing more expensive groundwater from the metropolitan water district to replace the water supply formerly obtained from these wells 
scw is negotiating with two of the potentially responsible parties for continuation of recovery of its increased costs 
scw has recently been sued on water quality issues 
in addition  we are subject to increasing regulation relating to water quality matters 
weather our business may be affected by weather in a variety of ways 
for instance water volumes sold decrease during wet weather water volumes sold decrease during cold weather water volumes sold may also decrease during drought conditions if mandatory rationing is imposed we may be required to purchase more expensive water and to use less groundwater during drought conditions kilowatt hour sales of electricity decrease if winters are warmer than normal or summers are cooler than normal maintenance and capital expenditures decrease during periods of inclement weather adverse weather conditions may result in damage to our water and electric systems resulting in increased repair and capital replacement costs  loss of sales and loss of water from broken reservoirs and mains weather patterns in california are inherently uncertain 
it is therefore difficult to predict from year to year the impact of weather on our financial results 
unregulated activities asus was formed for the purpose of  among other things  operating and maintaining municipally owned water systems and providing billing  meter reading and other services for municipalities and special water districts and making investments in subsidiaries and other entities 
these activities present different risks than cpuc regulated activities 
asus does not have extensive experience in engaging in these types of activities and must compete with other private parties with more experience and greater capital resources 
it must also compete with special water districts and other government agencies that may have a lower cost of funds and other competitive advantages afforded governmental entities 
awr s ability to earn a profit on these activities will depend upon a variety of factors  including its ability to obtain contracts in a competitive marketplace its ability to price its services at a level sufficient to enable it to earn a profit its ability to recover the costs of obtaining contracts in a competitive marketplace the cost of developing the privatization market in california its ability to operate in a cost effective matter its ability to negotiate contracts containing favorable terms our unregulated activities are not currently profitable 
as a result  our unregulated activities cannot currently be financed from awr s earnings 
under california law  scw is not permitted to issue securities to finance unregulated activities 
our unregulated activities must therefore be financed directly by awr or its unregulated subsidiaries or from dividends received by awr from scw 
to the extent that awr s activities are financed from dividends from scw  the funds available for the payment of dividends to awr s shareholders will be reduced 
potential year risks we are currently addressing the effect of the year yk issue on our reporting systems and operations 
we are also assessing operational risks related to our suppliers and vendors and developing contingency plans in order to mitigate this risk 
we have not currently experienced significant costs with respect to addressing these issues 
we anticipate completion of our assessment of risks related to our suppliers and vendors and our operational contingency plan by june the primary business risk associated with yk is our ability to continue to treat  transport and distribute water to our customers without interruption 
our operations could be significantly impacted if we are unable to resolve or fail to identify all yk problems prior to january  any of our critical suppliers and vendors  such as suppliers of chemicals for water treatment or electric utilities  are unable to resolve or fail to identify all yk problems affecting our business prior to january  we are unable to mitigate or fail to address all operational risks in our contingency plans capital expenditures we anticipate spending approximately million on capital expenditures during the next months 
we anticipate that approximately to of these funds will come from developers and other external sources 
the price and terms of this funding will depend upon conditions in the capital markets at the time funds are needed 
we anticipate that capital expenditures will continue to increase due to a variety of factors  including the need to replace aging infrastructure the need to comply with increasingly stringent environmental requirements the need to address potential water shortage problems the need to address water quality problems capital expenditures may also increase if awr is successful in its privatization efforts since many municipalities view privatization as a means to finance needed capital improvements 
economic conditions our ability to finance capital expenditures  unregulated activities and other matters will depend upon general economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets 
conditions in the capital markets are currently uncertain 
we are unable to predict to what extent this uncertainty may impact our access to capital or financing costs or our ability to compete in the privatization market 
interest rates have recently been declining 
declining interest rates are generally believed to be favorable for utilities because of their high capital costs 
on the other hand  scw s authorized rate of return may be reduced because of lower interest rates 
as a result  funds available for the payment of dividends may be reduced 
sales may also be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions if business activity and employment are reduced 
condemnation under california law  a governmental agency may acquire public utility property through the power of eminent domain  also know as condemnation 
although we have not had any of our systems condemned during the past three years  the potential for condemnation nevertheless remains
