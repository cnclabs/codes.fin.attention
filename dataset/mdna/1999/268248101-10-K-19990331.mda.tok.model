item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we derive our revenues primarily from one time and annual licenses with corporate  government  and oem customers and channel partners  software maintenance fees from site license agreements with corporate and government customers  one time fees for direct licenses to consumers  and royalties  including initial nonrefundable royalties  from license arrangements with channel partners and oems 
revenues from site license agreements generally consist of a one time license fee based on the number of individual users licensed or an annual distribution license fee based on the extent of the customer s distribution 
for each site license agreement  an annual software maintenance fee is calculated based upon a percentage of the one time or annual license fee 
payment of the maintenance fee permits customers to receive updates and enhancements to the software licensed for the duration of the maintenance agreement 
royalty revenues are earned in one of the following ways as a percentage of net revenues from product unit sales by licensees that incorporate our products  as a fixed per unit royalty  or as a regular periodic fee based on estimated shipments or usage over time 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers outside the united states 
such revenues totaled   and of total net revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect that the international market will continue to account for a significant portion of our total business 
our export revenues are transacted primarily in us dollars 
therefore  we believe that we are not exposed to significant risk with respect to changing currency exchange rates in connection with our business with international customers 
we generally denominate the prices for our corporate and end user products sold internationally in us dollars 
business with overseas end users may be subject to greater currency exchange rate risk in the future 
see certain factors that may affect future operating results 
cost of revenues primarily comprises the amortization of capitalized product development costs and certain assets from acquisitions and license agreements described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  royalty expense for the licensing of technology  fulfillment  and service and support costs 
the level of amortization expense of capitalized product development costs is directly related to the amount of product development costs capitalized in each year and the time frame in which a specific product is made available for general release to customers 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income statement data expressed as a percentage of revenues

net revenues declined in over also as a result of an increase of  in returns  refunds  and allowances 
revenues from product licenses in decreased  or  to  compared to  for the decline was mainly due to the sale of our linguistic assets to lernout and hauspie as noted above as well as a decline in revenue from our dynamic document exchange operating segment 
service revenues in increased  or  to  compared to  for the increase was mainly due to an increase in maintenance support and consulting sold with our product offerings as well as added service revenues from the acquisition of the product data management segment in december revenues from the dynamic document exchange segment declined by approximately from  in to  in the decline was mainly due to lower sales of quick view plus as we exited our retail business and experienced lower volume with corporate customers

sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to  for from  for excluding the sales and marketing expenses associated with the assets sold to lernout hauspie  sales and marketing expenses increased  or  for compared to the increase was primarily the result of costs relating to the reorganization of the sales and marketing departments as well as a charge of  related to an international distributor 
during  we entered into an international distribution agreement that provided the distributor with guaranteed levels of net receipts  as defined by the agreement  of  for each year ended december  and as of december   we believe that the distributor will not be able to achieve defined net receipts in either year 
therefore  the company recorded a charge to sales and marketing expenses of  excluding the sales and marketing expenses associated with the assets sold to lernout hauspie  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues for compared to for the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the aforementioned distributor charge 
product development costs consist primarily of personnel costs and  to a lesser extent  fees paid for outside software development and consulting services 
product development expenses decreased  or  from  for to  for excluding the product development expenses associated with the assets sold to lernout hauspie  product development costs increased by  or  for compared to the increase was primarily due to lower capitalized costs in due to the release of dynabase product at the end of as well as additional development expenses for the acquisitions

we adopted the straight line depreciation method for all equipment placed in service on or after january  the equipment under the straight line method is being depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets  generally three to five years 
we believe that the straight line method of depreciation provides a preferable matching between expected productivity and cost allocation since the equipment s operating capacity and consumption generally remains consistent over time 
the change in depreciation methods was not material to our operating results or our financial position 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues for increased  or  to  compared to  for approximately of revenues in included revenues from the acquisitions of mastersoft  level five research  inc  and henderson software  inc direct  distribution  and retail sales of products such as quick view plus and dynatext significantly contributed to the increase in revenues during as compared to  resulting in direct  distribution  and retail product licenses representing of total revenues 
revenues from product licenses in increased  or  to  compared to  for this increase was mainly due to the growth in quick view plus and dynatext revenue as noted above 
service revenues for increased  or  to  compared to  for the increase was mainly due to an increase in maintenance support and consulting sold with our product offerings 
hewlett packard  lucent technologies  and banque paribas were among the licensees who entered into site license agreements with us for quick view plus during american honda motor company licensed dynatext and siemens nixdorf licensed both dynatext registered trademark and dynaweb registered trademark 
non refundable royalty advances and royalty revenues for decreased as compared to the same period in non refundable royalty advances and royalty revenues were both affected in by weakness in the oem markets served by certain lexical and linguistic products of inso as well as a decline in royalty revenues from microsoft corporation 
revenues from the dynamic document exchange segment increased from  in to  in the increase relates mainly to sales of quick view plus to corporate customers 
revenues from the electronic publishing solutions segment increased from  in to  in the products comprising the eps segment were originally acquired in july gross profit increased  or  from  in to  in gross profit as a percentage of revenues for were compared to for the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to higher revenues from quick view plus  outside in  dynatext  and mastersoft s viewer  which carry lower royalty burdens

the decline in non refundable royalty advances and royalty revenues as discussed above affected our operating expenses as a percent of revenue 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  and bonuses for sales and marketing personnel and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  to  for from  for the increase reflected increased costs for staff additions  emphasis on new markets corporate and consumer  new expenses from acquired companies  and higher commissions due to increased revenues 
during  these expenses also included certain one time charges related to the reorganization of the sales and marketing departments 
sales and marketing expenses were of revenues for compared to for product development costs consist primarily of personnel costs and  to a lesser extent  fees paid for outside software development and consulting services 
product development expenses increased  from  for to  for the increase in product development costs was primarily due to our investments in viewing  conversion and other information sharing  publishing  and distribution products

our total product development costs  including capitalized costs  were  or of revenues  for compared to  or of revenues  for general and administrative expenses increased  to  for compared to  for the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases in personnel and general expenses required to support the growth in our operations 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to for compared to for the acquisitions of mastersoft  level five research  inc  and henderson software  inc  included the purchase of certain technology under research and development  which resulted in charges to our consolidated results of  or per share 
in june  we adopted a plan of restructuring aimed at a continuing focus on strategic products while reducing costs and streamlining the organization 
as part of the restructuring  we substantially reduced our spending on products in slower growing markets and redirected our resources to those products with larger market opportunities 
the plan primarily affected certain lexical and linguistic products 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recorded  of expenses 
the charge included  of severance for employees in development   of estimated lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for the impact of affected leases   for the write off of capitalized software and other assets  and  for the write off of prepaid royalties 
as of december   there were no remaining liabilities accrued

liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided cash of   and  for   and  respectively 
the decreased contribution from operating activities of  from to was primarily due to the overall lower level of earnings in during  we entered into a distribution agreement with an international distributor that guaranteed certain levels of net receipts  as defined by the agreement  for specified geographic areas primarily australia  new zealand  and certain countries in the far east 
as of december   we believe that the distributor will be not able to achieve defined net receipts from the agreement territory 
therefore  we recorded obligations of  relating to the guarantees 
our investing activities used cash of   and  in   and  respectively 
the decrease of  from to was due to the proceeds of  received from lernout hauspie for the sale of our linguistic software assets  a decrease in capitalized product development costs of  and a decline in net purchases of marketable securities of  offset by an increase in acquisition activity of  the acquisitions of paradigm development corporation  sherpa systems corporation  mediabank  and viewport development ab were all paid for using available cash 
the investing activity in also included the payment of  to the former principal stockholder of inso providence 
in december  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of privately held sherpa systems corporation for total consideration paid of  consisting of  of available cash  which has been accrued for at december  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the warrants at the time of the acquisition were valued at per warrant  or  the warrants have a month term and the right to purchase shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in january  we paid  of the remaining proceeds for the sherpa acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  we also caused sherpa to enter into employment and noncompetition agreements with key executives 
we will make aggregate payments of approximately  over the next three years under those agreements 
on february   we announced that we would restate our financial results for the quarters ended march  june and september   respectively 
subsequent to the announcement  we initiated discussions with warrant holders to reprice the warrants or exchange them for cash with the objective of meeting the intention of the original agreement 
the sherpa acquisition also included estimated costs of approximately  for direct transaction costs and costs relating to the elimination of excess and duplicative activities as a result of the merger 
as of december   all of the estimated costs of  were included in accrued acquisition related liabilities on the related balance sheet 
during  payments against the accruals are expected to include severance for elimination of duplicate functions and closure of duplicate and excess operations  cancellation of facility leases and other contracts for closed operations  professional fees consisting principally of appraisal  legal  and accounting fees  and other out of pocket expenses related to the acquisition 
employee terminations are expected to be in the areas of sales  marketing  and administrative functions 
a majority of the payments relating to the accrual are expected to be made during on january   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of privately held ais software sa for approximately  using available cash 
our financing activities provided cash of   and  in   and  respectively 
the increase from to relates to an increase in the proceeds received from stock option exercises and proceeds from repayment of notes receivable underlying stock purchase agreements 
also  in december  we repaid  of indebtedness assumed during the acquisitions of sherpa systems corporation and venture labs  inc in november  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  which provided net proceeds of approximately  on february   we repaid the outstanding promissory notes of  issued in connection with the acquisition of inso chicago 
as of december   we had obligations of  relating to capital leases 
as a result of our february  announcement as mentioned above  certain class action lawsuits were filed against inso and certain of our officers and employees in the us district court in massachusetts claiming violations of the federal securities laws based on alleged misrepresentations regarding inso s revenue and earnings for the first three quarters of fiscal these actions seek unspecified damages 
we believe the claims are subject to meritorious defenses  which we plan to assert during the lawsuit 
we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of these actions at this time  and there can be no assurance that the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
while it is not feasible to predict the total costs  we expect to incur significant professional fees in connection with the investigation of the accounting errors and irregularities that led to our restatement of financial results for the quarters ended march  june  and september  as well as fees with respect to the shareholder litigation filed against us subsequent to our announcement of the restatement 
we are presently evaluating our organizational and operating structure 
the result of this review could result in changes to our operations  the outcome of which cannot be predicted at this time 
as of december   we had working capital of  cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as of december  totaled  which includes restricted marketable securities of  supporting outstanding letters of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that current funds and funds expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations through the foreseeable future 
when acquired on december   sherpa had a line of credit with a bank  which provided for borrowings based on eligible accounts receivable  up to a maximum of  with interest therein at the bank s prime rate 
this line of credit facility had a termination date of february  at december   we had no borrowings under this agreement and have no plans to renew the line of credit 
in november  the board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year to february through january  effective for the twelve month period ending january  through december   we reported results on a calendar year basis 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities 
we do not believe that this standard will have a material impact on our results 
in  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions effective for fiscal years beginning after march  sop defines vendor specific objective evidence of fair value in connection with software revenue recognition 
the adoption of sop is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
acquired in process research and development our acquisitions included certain material purchased in process research and development charges for venture labs inc  sherpa systems corporation  and mediabank totaling  these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges on the respective acquisition dates as the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and therefore had no alternative future uses 
we engaged an independent appraiser to estimate the fair market value of the assets acquired  to serve as a basis for the allocation of the purchase price 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
the values of the purchased in process research and development were based upon future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the resulting projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
the revenue estimates used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in the related technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors 
the projected net cash flows were discounted to their present value using the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise 
the wacc used in the projections ranged from to 
the estimates used in valuing the in process research and development were based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
our assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
any such variances may adversely affect the sales and profitability of future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets recorded at the time of the respective acquisitions may become impaired 
venture labs  inc 
the primary purchased in process technology acquired in the venture labs  inc acquisition were the java filtering and viewing projects 
these were divided into three projects 
doqkit is a software developers kit written in java that permits the incorporation of file viewers and filters into java applications 
doqview server is a java plug in that permits documents to be converted from their formats into html on the fly and on demand 
doqview is a document viewing application that primarily allows users of computers using unix based operating systems to view microsoft office documents without the native windows application 
we estimate that each of these projects was between and complete at the date of the venture labs  inc acquisition 
we currently estimate that the costs to develop the in process technology acquired in the venture labs  inc acquisition will be approximately  in fiscal year sherpa systems corporation the primary purchased in process technology acquired in the sherpa systems corporation acquisition was the sherpaworks version product 
this technology is planned to implement a three tier architecture which will provide out of the box  configurable product data management systems that are easy to use and that support open standards based interfaces 
sherpaworks is expected to provide an open user interface framework that allows application developers to implement an application or user role specific interface 
we estimate that this project was approximately complete at the date of the sherpa acquisition 
additionally  we estimate that  will be required to be expended in fiscal year to complete the remaining development of this product 
mediabank the primary purchased in process technology acquired in the mediabank acquisition was the new digital asset management products  which were divided into two projects 
the first project was a media asset management technology that provides support for standard query language sql databases  such as oracle and microsoft s sql server 
in addition  this project also provides server capabilities that allow users to manage and retrieve assets stored in the asset management systems through a standard web browser 
we estimate that this project was complete at the time of the mediabank acquisition 
the second project provides content management capabilities based on the contents of text embedded in popular text formats which are stored in the database 
in addition  the second project provides support for db  a popular relational database developed by ibm  and ibm s digital library product 
we estimate that this project was complete at the time of the mediabank acquisition 
we currently estimate that the costs to develop the in process technology acquired in the mediabank acquisition will be approximately  in fiscal year acquired in process research and development and in connection with our acquisitions of henderson software  inc  level five research  inc  and adobe systems inc 
s mastersoft business during  we purchased certain technology under research and development totaling  in connection with our acquisitions of electronic book technologies  inc and imagemark software labs  inc during  we purchased certain technology under research and development totaling  these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges on the respective acquisition dates as the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility  and therefore  had no alternative future uses 
we engaged an independent appraiser to estimate the fair market value of the assets acquired  to serve as a basis for the allocation of the purchase price 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchase in process technology into commercially viable products was substantially completed as of december  as such  no significant costs remain 
year many components of computers and the programs that run on them were designed with attention to only the last two digits of the calendar year 
any equipment or program recognizing only two digits may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risk for us from unforeseen problems in our products or our own computer systems and from third parties with whom we transact business worldwide 
failure of year defects in our and or third parties computer systems or year defects in our products could have a material impact on our ability to conduct our business 
in late  we commenced a phased year compliance plan the plan to assess  remediate  test  and implement plans for all applications and products potentially affected by the year issue 
to accelerate overall completion  plan activities are often concurrent rather than serial  but all phases are expected to be completed by mid specifically  the plan addresses the software we sell and all software on which it depends  the hardware  operating systems and software on which we run our business and the third party services on which we also depend 
our costs to date have not been material to our operations and total costs of implementing the plan are not expected to be material to our fiscal year results 
however  there can be no assurances that we will not incur material costs related to the year issue  nor that our y compliance plan will detect all potential year issues 
internal staff are the primary resources working on the plan  although we do not anticipate having to defer any other it projects in our effort to become y compliant 
we expect to fund the cost of completing the plan through our operating cash flows 
inso products in addition  the year issue could affect the products that we license 
all inso products have been tested for year compliance 
additionally  we have completed our assessment of the products  which we license as components of products that we sell 
the product compliance statements are listed on our website  and where necessary  we are in the process of informing customers of the proper migration path to year compliant versions 
our most important products are not considered date dependent and any work to bring the current versions of these products to year compliance has been incorporated into the normal update cycle 
the cost of this effort and the projected completion costs have not been material 
inso internal systems and facilities we have inventoried hardware and software on which we develop our products and run our internal systems 
all inventoried items have been categorized as compliant  compliant with patches  or not compliant 
we have begun addressing the items in the compliant with patches category  schedules are in place to upgrade these items 
in some cases  we are dependent upon vendors completing their patches to meet our mid targeted completion date for correcting these items 
we have scheduled retirement and or replacement of non compliant items 
the cost of this effort and the projected completion costs have not been material 
however  we may experience material unanticipated problems and costs by undetected errors of technology used in our internal it and non it systems 
we have contacted all utility and facilities vendors on which we depend 
these vendors have provided compliance statements certifying that they will be year compliant by the end of we acknowledge that we are vulnerable  as are most organizations  to the inability of these external organizations to achieve year readiness 
contingency plan our technical support group and our professional services group will be made available to resolve any product issues that may arise 
our information systems group is developing a comprehensive checklist to verify internal and external systems 
there can be no assurance that our contingency plans will adequately address all year issues that may arise 
the most reasonable worst case scenario has not been clearly identified 
inso management believes that an effective program to resolve the year issue in a timely manner is in place 
as noted above  we have not completed all phases of the year compliance plan 
based upon current information  we believe that the correction of the year issues should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurances that we will not incur material costs related to the year issue 
certain factors that may affect future operating results in  we received the majority of our revenues from direct and indirect sales efforts aimed at corporations and government agencies 
the marketing and distribution of products to these markets  either by inso or by value added resellers or distributors  required higher sales and marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenues than the oem distribution channel which we used previously  and were higher than comparable industry averages  which reduced our operating margins 
we intend to maintain corporate and government sales activities through continuing direct sales efforts and the marketing of new solutions for enterprise use 
this could burden our level of sales and marketing expenditures relative to revenues  which could lower our operating margins in future periods 
additionally  the recent sales force reorganization leaves us with a number of key positions vacant  especially  in international sales management 
even with an all out recruitment effort  we expect that international sales will be adversely affected during at least the first two quarters of our ability to remain competitive in the computer software industry is dependent on the services of a number of key management and technical personnel  principally software engineers 
personnel costs for technical staff represent a significant portion of our operating expenses  and increased competition and related personnel cost increases for such staff could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
additionally  because of the recent drop in inso s stock price we may need to use larger amounts of cash to compensate our employees  rather than the equity incentives we have relied on in prior periods 
this could result in reduced operating margins as a result of higher personnel costs 
we operate in distinct markets 
the product data management and electronic publishing solutions operating segments derive the majority of their revenues from the market for enterprise software applications and solutions 
this market tends to be dominated by very large entities  such as sap  oracle  and ibm  which have substantially greater resources than we do  and which compete on a worldwide basis with respect to implementation services  local x support  and other factors 
as we develop solutions for license on an enterprise basis  we anticipate that we will be required to increase substantially our investment in such service and support functions  which could have an adverse impact on future operating results 
at the same time  because of our limited size  it is likely that we will enter into relationships or agreements with large service providers and integrators in order to provide our customers with the implementation services and support that they require 
the failure to create such relationships could jeopardize our ability to generate revenues from sales of enterprise software solutions as our operations expand 
we have invested significant development resources in products utilizing standards based publishing formats  such as sgml and xml 
should large numbers of customers and potential customers not ultimately adopt any such standard  it is possible that there may be a limited market for the products we are currently developing  which could have an adverse impact on future revenues and operating results 
we have historically received a significant portion of our revenues from oems that integrate our products with their own products and market them to end users as a single unit 
the business of our oem customers is intensely competitive  while the computer software industry has continued to consolidate 
as a result  the number of potentially significant oem customers for our products has declined and there is increasing competitive pressure for our existing and potential customers to reduce costs 
also  certain markets for our products were particularly adversely affected by competitive pressures during  a trend that is likely to continue in future periods 
at the same time  we have achieved a high degree of market penetration in certain oem markets for our products  making it more difficult to make new sales to oem customers 
these factors could result in decreased revenues from oems in future periods 
we anticipate that we will begin to market in a number of oem products that have been developed using the java programming language  and we have made significant investments in developing java programs 
should our oem customers ultimately choose not to adopt java as a development platform  our ability to derive revenue from our investments in java technology would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  our java products have not been implemented or accepted in the market  and there is the possibility that undetected defects or errors in those products could result in unanticipated support costs and product delays  which could adversely affect future operating results 
it is possible that certain of the major operating system developers  including microsoft  may add features and functionality to such operating systems  including future versions of windows registered trademark and windows nt registered trademark  that may compete with our products or with those of our other oem customers 
the concentration of the market for operating systems makes it difficult or impossible for us or our other oem customers to compete on a price basis because purchasers of operating systems would be required to purchase products as part of the operating system that compete with our products 
in addition  certain oem customers  such as microsoft  may choose to internally develop products that compete with our products in order to reduce their costs 
we have relied on acquisitions to create growth and provide new technologies 
the majority of our revenues in were derived from businesses that were acquired by us during or thereafter  and it is anticipated that all our revenues will come from such acquired businesses in as a result of recent adverse trends in the price of our common stock  it may be more difficult for us to engage in acquisitions in the future  which could slow our revenue growth 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to integrate and manage successfully businesses or assets that we have acquired or may acquire in the future 
if our management is unable to manage such acquisitions effectively  the quality of our products  our ability to identify  hire  and retain key personnel  and the results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we have restated our previously disclosed financial results for the first three quarters of in march  primarily as a result of adjustments to revenues resulting from transactions with foreign distributors 
immediately following the first announcement that we intended to restate our financial results  inso and certain of its officers and employees were sued by purported representatives of a class of the company s current and former stockholders 
we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of these actions at this time  and there can be no assurance that the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
while it is not feasible to predict the total costs  we expect to incur significant professional fees in connection with the investigation that led to our restatement of financial results for the quarters ended march  june  and september  as well as fees with respect to the shareholder litigation filed against us subsequent to our announcement of the restatement 
we have increased the marketing of our products directly to customers outside the united states but did not achieve growth in revenues from foreign customers in the failure to achieve significant growth in foreign sales during could have an adverse impact on our revenue growth and operating results 
the marketing of products directly to customers outside the united states increases the risk to our revenues associated with fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies 
such fluctuations could also result in increased operating expenses associated with foreign operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inso is exposed to the impact of interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
our cash equivalents and available for sale investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair value of our investments 
we manage the exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio and investing in short term investment grade corporate securities  united states agency bonds  and asset backed securities 
in addition  we do not use investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in interest rates 
as of december   the analysis indicated that the change in interest income would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
additionally  the carrying value of our investments approximates the fair value and therefore the impact of a fluctuation in interest rates to the carrying value is not material to our financial position or results of operations 
however  actual interest income and gains and losses in the future may differ materially from our analysis 
we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily in certain european countries  japan and australia  and therefore are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we primarily license our technology in us dollars but operating expenses are denominated in the local currency 
for  we do not believe we had significant exposure associated with movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will evaluate the exposures going forward and will implement the appropriate risk management procedures as deemed necessary 
at december   we had certain forward exchange contracts primarily british pounds sterling  german marks  italian lira  french francs  and swiss francs maturing in january with a notional amount outstanding of approximately  the estimated unrealized gains and losses for these forward exchange contracts were not material to our results of operations or financial position at december  we presently have no plans to renew the forward exchange contracts after the january maturity
