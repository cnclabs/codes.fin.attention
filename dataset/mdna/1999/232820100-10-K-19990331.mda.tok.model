on january   the company completed the sale of its remaining molding compounds product line  which had sales of and  in and  respectively 
approximately one third of the company s and production of building block chemicals was used internally in the manufacture of other company products 
in more than one half of such production was used internally 
such internal usage is not reflected in building block chemicals net sales 
the decrease in internal usage is the result of the sale of the acrylic fibers product line in january sales of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the acrylic fibers product line are included above in net sales of building block chemicals for and in prior years  these sales were recorded as internal transfers 
and includes acrylic fibers sales of and  respectively 
the acrylic fibers product line was sold on january  the company has a interest in each of four unconsolidated associated companies cyro industries  criterion catalyst  mitsui cytec and ac molding compounds and had a interest in the former dyno cytec joint venture through july  the aggregate net sales of unconsolidated associated companies was in  in and in year ended december   compared with year ended december  net sales for were  which were approximately higher in comparison with net sales of  the increase is mainly attributable to sales generated as a result of the acquisitions of fiberite  the oreprep product line and the dyno business 
included in are sales of from the acrylic fibers product line that was divested on january  sales outside of the united states for the full year were of total sales  a decrease of when compared with international sales 
this was primarily a result of the inclusion of fiberite sales  which are principally us based 
sales in the asia pacific region were down for the year 
the decrease was mainly due to the region s financial crisis and to the effect of adverse exchange rate fluctuations 
overall sales to this region were about of total cytec sales 
water and industrial process chemicals net sales decreased or 
sales volumes were up  while selling prices and exchange rates were down and  respectively 
the increase in international sales volumes was partially offset by a decrease in paper and water treating chemical us sales volumes 
performance products net sales increased or 
excluding sales as a result of the purchase of the dyno business acquisition  sales were down or 
the decrease was mainly attributable to polymer additives 
lower prices in the united states and europe and lower volumes in asia were primarily responsible for the polymer additives decrease 
specialty materials net sales increased or 
this was primarily due to sales generated as a result of the fiberite acquisition 
including pro forma fiberite sales in  sales increased or 
the pro forma sales increase was primarily due to higher build rates in the commercial aircraft sector 
the company s largest specialty materials customer has experienced delays and cancellations of commercial aircraft orders as a result of the financial crisis in the asia pacific region 
however  the company expects the decrease in sales to its largest customer to be offset by an increase in sales to other customers and sales generated as a result of the amt acquisition 
building block chemicals net sales decreased or 
selling prices and volumes were down and  respectively 
selling prices for acrylonitrile and methanol continued downward  and are expected to remain at these low levels well into acrylonitrile volumes remain depressed due to a combination of high supply and weak demand  primarily in asia 
the acrylonitrile plant is operating at a reduced rate and will continue production at the lower rate until market conditions improve 
costs for propylene  the key raw material for production of acrylonitrile  are down  substantially offsetting the impact of lower selling prices 
the methanol market remains weak  and on march   the plant was shut down for market related reasons 
manufacturing cost of sales for the full year decreased from of sales to 
included in were the unfavorable effects of restructuring and other charges totaling relating primarily to manufacturing sites at fortier  louisiana  willow island  west virginia  botlek  the netherlands  and linden  new jersey 
excluding the restructuring and other charges in  the manufacturing cost of sales increased in due to a decrease in operating capacity resulting from severe weather conditions primarily at the building block chemicals fortier facility in louisiana  and to adverse exchange rate fluctuations  which affected all segments 
in addition  the startup of the performance products benzotriazole light stabilizer plant increased expenses 
partially offsetting this was a reduction of retiree medical expenses and stock based employee compensation of selling and technical service expenses increased or 
included in are restructuring and other charges of relating to sales force and customer service restructuring and costs associated with the integration of fiberite

after adjusting and for the effects of these items net earnings increased per diluted common share or  and reflects the positive effects of the acquisitions made during the year  the reduced tax rate and the effect of the company s common stock repurchase program 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  net sales for were  which was higher in comparison with net sales of  included in are sales from the divested acrylic fibers and aluminum sulfate product lines and the discontinued technical chemicals product line 
included in are sales of acrylonitrile to the purchaser of the acrylic fibers line and sales of generated as a result of the purchase of fiberite as of september  excluding the above from and results  sales increased 
sales outside of the united states for the full year were  which was flat compared with international sales 
this was primarily a result of the acrylic fibers divestiture and the inclusion in the fourth quarter of fiberite sales  which are principally us based 
excluding fiberite  sales outside of the united states were with the growth primarily in european and latin american regions 
sales in the asia pacific region  excluding the effect of divested businesses  were up for the year  but down slightly in the fourth quarter 
fourth quarter results were partly due to the region s financial crisis and to the effect of unusual weather that caused certain customers mines to be shut down 
overall sales to this region were about of total cytec sales with approximately half of these sales at risk to currency fluctuations 
water and industrial process chemicals net sales increased or 
sales volumes were up  while selling prices and exchange rates were down and  respectively 
sales volume increased in all product lines with mining and water treatment chemicals having the largest increase 
paper chemicals had a sales volume increase with the largest increase in the asia pacific region 
performance products net sales increased or 
sales volumes were up  while selling prices and exchange rates were down and  respectively 
all product lines experienced increased sales volumes with the exception of conap  which had lower sales to distributors 
polymer additives experienced the largest sales volume increase principally as a result of increased sales in asia 
specialty materials net sales increased or 
sales rose principally due to the acquisition of fiberite and the strong performance of aerospace materials products in the commercial aircraft sector 
building block chemicals net sales increased or 
included in were acrylonitrile sales of to the purchaser of the acrylic fibers product line that were treated as internal transfers prior to the divestiture 
excluding these sales  the net increase for the year was 
both acrylonitrile and methanol sales volumes were higher 
the methanol facility was shut down in january due to high natural gas costs and during the second quarter of for mechanical repairs to the reactor 
restructuring charges of were recorded in the company does not charge these costs to its operating segments but accumulates them on a corporate basis 
the breakdown of these costs by segment is as follows specialty chemicals building water industrial performance specialty block process chemicals products materials chemicals total manufacturing cost of sales selling and technical services research and process development administrative and general total manufacturing cost of sales for the full year increased from of sales to 
included in were the unfavorable effects of restructuring and other charges totaling relating primarily to manufacturing sites at fortier  louisiana  willow island  west virginia  botlek  the netherlands  and linden  new jersey 
excluding the total restructuring and other charges of in  the cost of sales improved to 
this was the result of an improved product sales mix  the effect of improving plant efficiency and continuing cost reduction programs 
partially offsetting these were higher costs for raw materials and the adverse impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
selling and technical service expenses increased or 
included in are restructuring and other charges of relating to sales force and customer service restructuring and costs relating to the integration of fiberite 
excluding these charges  selling and technical service expenses increased  reflecting increased sales efforts in international markets and the support of domestic sales growth in the specialty chemical segments 
research and process development expenses for the full year increased or 
included in are restructuring and other charges of of which related to the reduction of corporate research and development overhead and related to the write off of in process research and development acquired from fiberite 
excluding these charges  research and development expenses increased  reflecting continued effort in technical programs in the specialty chemical segments 
administrative and general expenses increased or 
included in are restructuring and other charges of relating to corporate headquarters restructuring and costs for reorganizing the legal entity structure in europe 
excluding these charges  administrative and general expenses increased 
amortization of acquisition intangibles increased due to intangibles associated with the fiberite acquisition 
other income  net  improved included in was a gain related to divested product lines and charges of for reducing the carrying amount of the company s subsidiary conap  inc to net realizable value and expected losses on certain other assets being held for sale 
equity in earnings of associated companies  all of which are owned  represents the company s before tax share of its associates earnings 
such earnings decreased mainly due to a decline in earnings at criterion catalyst resulting from a less favorable product mix  lower selling prices and operating inefficiencies 
interest expense  net  increased as a result of long term debt associated with the acquisition of fiberite 
also included is a charge of for up front costs to fund the acquisition of fiberite 
the income tax provision in includes a favorable reversal of the tax valuation allowance of the effective tax rate for the year also includes the impact of a portion of the restructuring and other charges for which no tax benefit was attributable 
in the rate included a one time benefit related to a noncash transaction in the fourth quarter 
excluding these nonrecurring items for each year  the effective tax rate was in  compared with in this reduction was due to improved tax planning and increased sales by the company s foreign sales corporation

also included in was the favorable reversal of the tax valuation allowance of  or per diluted common share  and an after tax gain from the first quarter of of  or per diluted common share  primarily relating to the acrylic fibers product line divestiture 
excluding these items  the diluted earnings per share for was 
this represents an increase of per diluted common share  compared with the full year  and reflects higher earnings and the effect of the company s common stock repurchase program 
liquidity and financial condition at december   the company s cash balance was  a decrease of from year end net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled for the year ended december   compared with in the same period of significant factors in this increase were higher earnings and the company s decision to prefund of its postretirement benefits liability in  compared with of such prefunding payments in  through contributions to its voluntary employee benefit association veba trust accounts by utilizing some of the proceeds from the sale of the acrylic fibers product line 
payments against restructuring reserves were in  as compared with in at december   the liability to be paid was  essentially all of which is for employee related costs 
the spending is expected to be substantially completed by the end of with the exception of certain long term payouts for employee severance 
environmental remediation spending for the years ended december   and  was  and  respectively 
the company expects similar levels in  though there can be no assurances that the company s annual cash expenditures will not be higher in the future 
while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental suits and claims  it is reasonably possible that there will be a necessity for future provisions for environmental costs which  in management s opinion  will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company  but could be material to the consolidated results of operations of the company in any one accounting period 
the company cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amount 
moreover  environmental liabilities are paid over an extended period  and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any confidence 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements with respect to environmental matters 
the company is also a party to various other claims and routine litigation arising in the normal course of its business 
based on the advice of counsel  management believes that the resolution of such claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but could be material to the consolidated results of operations of the company in any one accounting period 
net cash flows used for investing activities totaled  compared with in included in was funding for the fiberite acquisition of  which was partially offset by proceeds of associated with the sale of the acrylic fibers products line 
included in was funding of for acquisition of the dyno business 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   of were higher than for the corresponding period in due primarily to certain large construction projects in the performance products segment  such as the benzotriazole light stabilizer plant in botlek  the netherlands  and the expansion of the surfactants plant in willow island  west virginia 
capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the range of to the company believes that  based on internal cash generation and current levels of liquid assets  it will be able to fund operating cash requirements and planned capital expenditures in net cash flows used for financing activities totaled  compared with provided by financing activities in long term debt increased primarily due to the purchase of treasury stock and the acquisitions of the oreprep product line and the dyno business 
in the company purchased a total of  shares of treasury stock at a cost of this completed the stock repurchase program authorized in february in   shares were repurchased at a cost of in connection with the company s stock repurchase program  the company sold put options to an institutional investor in a series of private placements exempt from registration under section of the securities act of the put options entitled the holder to sell an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock to the company on certain dates at specified prices  subject to the company s right  in lieu of purchasing such shares  to pay the holder of the put the excess of the strike price over the then market price of the shares in either cash or additional shares of the company s common stock 
the company received premiums of approximately on the sale of such options 
during the year   of the put options expired unexercised  and the company purchased the remaining  shares of the company s common stock subject to the options for an aggregate of the company signed an agreement on april   with american cyanamid company cyanamid  a subsidiary of american home products corporation  to revise certain of the financial covenants contained in its series c cumulative preferred stock

the company on january   signed an agreement with cyanamid providing that cyanamid would irrevocably waive certain financial covenants contained in the series c cumulative preferred stock so that  in addition to restricted payments otherwise permitted under the series c cumulative preferred stock  which at december   were limited to  cytec may make up to in special restricted payments solely for the purpose of repurchasing cytec s common stock 
on january   the company s board of directors approved a program to spend up to to repurchase shares of outstanding common stock

the day facility  which provides for unsecured revolving loans for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  for purposes of making acquisitions  matures on august   and contains a two year term out option 
the interest rate on funds borrowed under the credit facility and the day facility floats based on libor 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the day facility 
the company sold an aggregate of principal amount of senior debt securities in public offerings in the first six months of  consisting of i principal amount of notes due march   ii principal amount of notes due march  and iii principal amount of mopprssm due may  the securities were offered under the company s shelf registration statement that has now been fully utilized 
the company received an aggregate of approximately in proceeds from the sales before deducting expenses associated with the sales 
the proceeds were used to repay of indebtedness under the fiberite acquisition facility  repay of indebtedness under the credit facility and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the fiberite acquisition and in contemplation of the offering of long term debt securities  the company entered into a series of rate lock agreements the rate lock agreements with several banks commencing in september pursuant to the rate lock agreements  the company hedged against the risk of an increase in treasury rates above the rates on the dates it entered into the rate lock agreements on an aggregate of in debt for periods of up to years

during and the company made contributions to its veba trust accounts to fund certain employee and retiree health care benefits 
the balance in the veba trust accounts at december   and was and  respectively 
the impact of inflation on the company is considered insignificant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a risk have been significantly hedged to mitigate the effects of inflation 
other year the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its information technology systems it systems and its process control and other systems that use micro controllers non it systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the year issue results from computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s systems that have time sensitive software features may recognize a date using in the last two places as the year rather than the year if not addressed  this could result in a system failure or miscalculations  and in the case of non it systems that are noncompliant  could have a material adverse impact on the integrity and safety of the company s chemical manufacturing processes 
the company has developed a phased program to address its year issues 
the first phase  which consisted of identifying the company s it and non it systems  has been completed 
the second phase consisted of determining whether those systems were year compliant  primarily based on certifications from the vendors of such systems  and developing cost estimates to remediate noncompliant systems 
the second phase is also complete 
the company s current estimate is that it will incur external costs in the range of to to remediate noncompliant systems  of which has been spent to date  and of which the remaining funds mostly consist of i funds committed but not yet spent  ii the cost of non mission critical systems and equipment  and iii the cost of testing 
this estimate may change materially as the company reviews the results of its work in the first two phases on a plant by plant basis using both internal and external resources and as the company continues to implement required remediation 
the company does not track its internal costs in connection with year issues  but does not believe they are material 
the third phase of the company s program is ongoing and consists of remediating noncompliant systems that are critical to the company s operations 
the company s goal is to largely complete the third phase by the end of the first quarter of the company then plans to test critical systems and to remediate  if appropriate  noncritical systems by the end of the second quarter of the company has not yet developed any contingency plans for addressing any problems in completing implementation of all necessary remediation by the year  but plans to commence development of such plans in the first quarter of the company has begun to address the year status of its material customers and suppliers by seeking verification that their systems and processes are  or by december   will be  year compliant 
these efforts may need to be refined as more information becomes available 
the company also is reviewing the year compliance efforts of the four associated companies in which it has a equity interest 
failure to complete any necessary remediation by the year may have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operations of the company 
failure of third parties  such as customers  suppliers or government agencies to remediate year problems in their it and non it systems which cannot be controlled or corrected by the company or any general economic slowdown due to year problems could also have a material adverse impact on the consolidated operations of the company 
possible consequences as a result of the company  customers  suppliers or government agencies not being fully year compliant include temporary plant closings  delays in the delivery of finished products  delays in the receipt of raw materials and invoice and collection errors 
these consequences could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
as part of its contingency plan  the company plans to address these potential consequences and mitigate the adverse effect any such disruptions may have on the company s operations 
euro conversion 
on january   of the member countries of the european union the participating countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies the legacy currencies and the euro 
the participating countries have agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
as of january   a newly created european central bank has begun to control monetary policy  including money supply and interest rates for the participating countries 
the legacy currencies are scheduled to remain legal tender in the participating countries as denominations of the euro between january   and january  the transition period 
during the transition period  public and private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the participating country s legacy currency on a no compulsion  no prohibition basis 
the company s principal plants in europe are in the netherlands  the united kingdom  norway and germany  and the company has sales offices and generates sales throughout europe 
the netherlands and germany are participating countries  whereas the united kingdom and norway are not currently participating countries 
effective january   the company is in a position to trade in euros 
the company has initiated and is evaluating on an ongoing basis the effects  if any  of the euro conversion upon its business 
factors being considered include  but are not limited to the possible impact of the euro conversion on revenues  expenses and income from continuing operations  the impact on cash management and treasury management functions  the competitive implications of increased price transparency  the ability to adapt information technology to accommodate euro denominated transactions  the market risks with respect to financial instruments  the continuity of material contracts  and the potential tax consequences 
the company does not believe that the initial remeasurement of the euro as the functional currency for those operations within the participating countries will result in any gains or losses since conversion rates to the euro for participating countries have been irrevocably fixed as of january  the company believes that some information systems modifications are required in order for them to be euro compliant 
the company  however  does not currently believe that the euro conversion will have a material operational or financial impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
the company s exposure to market risk from equity price changes was immaterial at december  market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  the company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with company established policies 
the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 
moreover  the company enters into financial instrument transactions either through regulated future exchanges or with major financial institutions  thereby limiting exposure to credit and performance related risks 
foreign exchange rate risk the risk of adverse exchange rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that there is no concentration of foreign currency exposure 
in addition  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   the principal transactions hedged were short term intercompany loans and intercompany trade accounts receivable and payable 
the maturity dates of the foreign exchange contracts are less than six months and strongly correlate to the maturity date of the underlying transaction 
the foreign exchange gains or losses and the offsetting losses or gains of the hedged transaction are marked to market and reflected in net earnings 
at december   the company had net foreign exchange contracts to purchase various currencies  principally british pounds and dutch guilders  for and to sell various currencies  principally dutch guilders and german marks for the differences between fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end and the contract amounts were immaterial 
assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would be a decrease of approximately however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
at december   non derivative financial instruments subject to foreign exchange rate risk consisted primarily of in foreign currency denominated short term debt 
assuming that year end exchange rates were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the increase in the fair value would be approximately commodity price risk occasionally  the company utilizes futures contracts  predominantly involving natural gas  to manage its exposure to price risk associated with the production of ammonia  methanol and other building block chemical products 
the maturity of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity 
the contracts are principally settled through actual delivery of the physical commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that the company pays for the underlying commodity
