direct costs were million  or of revenues  in fiscal as compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal this increase as a percent of revenues is due to the company s increased use of consultant expenses to meet project requirements 
the increase is primarily due to jpj s use of consultants in the period from november to april management believes that jpj will continue to use consultants which will cause direct costs as a percent of revenues to increase in future periods as jpj consultant expenses are reflected for a twelve month period

see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
interest expense was million in both fiscal and non operating income was million in fiscal the company reported no non operating income in fiscal non operating income in is principally due to the gain on a lease termination as a result of the cumulative excess of lease expense over the lease payments made as of the termination dates 
in fiscal  terminated facility leases resulted in a gain of million 
income tax expense was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the effective income tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the effective income tax rate was higher in fiscal principally due to nondeductible penalties in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at april   the company s current assets of million exceeded current liabilities of million resulting in working capital of million 
during the year ended april   the company used million in cash from operating activities  primarily related to the increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of compared to billings on uncompleted contracts and decreases in income taxes and accounts payable that were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid and other assets 
the company used million for investing activities  primarily the cash payment for the purchase of jpj  net of cash acquired  and to a lesser extent  the purchase of equipment and the acquisition of gaih 
on october   the company purchased all the issued and outstanding stock of jpj for million in cash million net of cash acquired  promissory notes bearing interest at seven percent in the aggregate principal amount of million and an aggregate of  shares of common stock to be issued on a delayed delivery basis

the company s growth and operating strategy will require substantial capital and may result in the company incurring additional debt  issuing equity securities or obtaining additional bank financing 
as the management company  the company will be responsible for the financing of working capital growth  capital growth and other cash needs of the managed firms 
see business hlm design operations management and services agreements 
on march   the company increased its revolving line of credit with first charter national bank from million to million 
at april   the company had outstanding borrowings thereunder of million 
the revolving line of credit is secured by  among other things  a security interest in all accounts receivable 
any outstanding balance under this loan bears interest at prime plus one percent 
this loan matures on june  the company believes that for present operations  the existing line of credit and anticipated funds from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s operating needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  in order to continue its expansion program through acquisitions  the company will require additional capital 
if the company is unable to obtain additional capital  its ability to implement its growth strategy will be adversely affected 
the company s operations are professional services and as such are not capital intensive 
however  in order to enhance productivity  the company has increased its purchase of computer hardware and software 
the company currently has no material commitments for purchases of additional equipment 
capital expenditures during fiscal were million 
seasonality the company s operations are not seasonal in nature 
effects of inflation due to the relatively low levels of inflation in fiscal years  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations for those periods 
year compliance many computer systems will not be able to process dates beyond and will need to be modified or replaced prior to the year many of the company s information technology purchases were made after january and management believes the company s internal software and hardware systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
year issues are also addressed as the company s network and internal systems are upgraded in the normal course of business 
as of april   the company s expenditures towards year compliance has been minimal and it does not expect its additional expenditures directly related to year compliance to exceed  management continually reassesses the estimated costs and status of the company s year compliance effort 
the company began conducting verification testing of all its internal information technology and information systems in the testing is a multi phased process which includes  but is not limited to  simulating several key dates and times in the year and performing normal daily activities 
the infrastructure  servers and workstations  as well as primary software systems  have been tested and validated using this process 
the final phase of testing is scheduled to be completed in october while management believes that its hardware and software applications are year compliant  there can be no assurance until the year occurs that all systems will then function adequately 
the company is monitoring all key vendors and suppliers for year compliance by various methods including  but not limited to  gathering information from a detailed survey sent by the company to each key vendor 
most of the company s significant suppliers and vendors have advised the company that they are  or anticipate being  year compliant 
if  however  other software applications of other suppliers or of local exchange carriers  long distance carriers  service providers  competitive access providers  or others on whose services the company depends are not year compliant  a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations could result 
the company is not aware of any significant vendor who may be unable to provide services to the company as a result of year non compliance 
the company currently has a disaster recovery plan in place which will serve as a foundation for its contingency plan in the event some suppliers and vendors are not year compliant 
the full contingency plan is currently being developed and will be complete late in significant materiality of goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets acquired 
the cumulative amount of goodwill at may  was million and at april  was million 
as a percentage of total assets and stockholders equity  goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  represented and  respectively  at may   and and  respectively  at april  generally accepted accounting principles require that goodwill and all other intangible assets be amortized over the period benefited 
we have determined that the period benefited by the goodwill will be no less than years 
accordingly  we are amortizing goodwill over a year period for hlmna and a year period for both jpj and gaih 
earnings reported in periods immediately following an acquisition would be overstated if the company attributed a or year benefit to an intangible asset that should have had a shorter benefit period 
in later years  the company would be burdened by a continuing charge against earnings without the associated benefit to income valued by management in arriving at the price paid for the businesses acquired 
earnings in later years also could be significantly affected if management then determined that the remaining balance of goodwill was impaired 
we periodically compare the carrying value of goodwill with the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operations of the businesses we have acquired in order to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill 
we have concluded that the anticipated future cash flows associated with intangible assets recognized in our acquisitions will continue indefinitely and there is no persuasive evidence that any material portion will dissipate over a period shorter than and years  respectively 
we expect to incur additional goodwill in future acquisitions 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standard board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
which redefines how operating segments are determined and requires disclosure of certain financial and descriptive information about a company s operating segments 
the company operates in one segment which provides architectural  engineering and planning services 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instrument and hedging activities 
this standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
the statement will become effective for the company beginning april however  the company has elected earlier application of all of the provisions of this statement beginning january  the implementation of the provisions of this statement did not have an impact on the company s financial statements for the year ended april  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has limited exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes 
specifically  the company has in place a  line of credit  which bears interest at the prime rate of the lender plus one percent 
at april   the company had borrowings under this line of credit of  and the effective interest rate at that date was 
while changes in the prime rate could affect the cost of funds borrowed in the future  the company believes the effect  if any  of reasonably forseeable near term changes in interest rates on the company s financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows would not be material 
the company has no other material exposure to market risk sensitive instruments
