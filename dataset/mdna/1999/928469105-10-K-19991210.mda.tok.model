this statement constitutes a forward looking statement under the reform act 
the company s liquidity could be adversely impacted and its need for capital could materially change if costs are higher than anticipated  the company were to undertake acquisitions demanding significant capital  operating results differ significantly from recent experience or adverse events affect the company s operations 
year compliance the year problem is the result of computer programs written with two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
a computer program written in that manner would recognize the entry of in a date field as referring to the year and not the year an error of this type could result in various types of miscalculations  systems failures and business process interruption 
this issue is not unique to the company and is sometimes known as yk  year or the millennium bug collectively  yk issues 
the company has examined its products and systems to assess and minimize what problems may be encountered with regard to the yk issues and the company s ability to transact business without interruption 
the company s primary focus on yk issues is to assure the ability to continue to provide safe and effective products to its customers and end users 
a technical review of the company s product lines addressing yk issues has been completed 
none of the company s single use products are affected by yk issues because their components do not include any form of microprocessor or clock 
in order to determine the potential impact of yk issues on the company s products  the company has inquired of its suppliers or subcontractors  as appropriate  to obtain an understanding that products will not be affected by yk issues 
most of these companies have been aware of this problem for several years and have advised that they have been working to prevent disruption in the goods and service they provide to customers 
the company has not developed a formal contingency plan for addressing problems resulting from vendors and suppliers of goods and services who are not year compliant 
however  based upon the company s yk issues compliance investigations  the company believes that as to most of the raw materials  supplies and services used in its business  alternative means of supply would be available to the extent a supplier or vendor was unable to continue to provide such materials  supplies or services due to yk issues 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if the supply of face masks from respironics  inc were interrupted as a result of yk issues including  without limitation  yk issues relating to common carriers in transporting face masks from the place of manufacture in china  no assurance can be given that the company could maintain the required supply of face masks in the quantity and at a cost that would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  including sale of compatible products 
the company will continue its communication with its suppliers including respironics to address adverse consequence of yk issues 
however  no assurance can be given and the company s policy is to maintain a sufficient inventory of face masks to lessen the impact of temporary interruptions 
the company began a process of upgrading its computer software approximately three years ago 
while this effort was not undertaken in order to address yk issues  the need to upgrade the software occurred contemporaneously with an increased awareness of yk issues 
the hardware and software components purchased or licensed by the company in connection with the upgrade of the computer software were analyzed for yk issues compliance 
the company s software upgrade became fully operational during the fourth quarter of calendar year because the upgrade of the computer software was to address increases in volume  number of users and unsupported software  the company has not ascribed any of these computer costs to yk issues compliance  but as capital expenditures made in the ordinary course of business 
several of the company s in house manufacturing lines used to manufacture raw materials into component parts are controlled by equipment incorporating microprocessors 
the company also has certain other operating equipment which incorporate microprocessors 
the company has made inquiry of manufacturers and providers of certain key equipment and device contract companies and is upgrading certain equipment 
the company believes that the costs to upgrade such equipment are not expected to be material to the company and that such other equipment material to the company s operations will not be materially effected by yk issues 
the estimates and conclusions herein with respect to yk issues are forward looking statements under the reform act and are based on management s best estimates of future events 
actual results could differ materially from the company s estimates and conclusions as a result of a number of factors including the availability of resources  the ability to discover and correct the potential yk sensitive issues which could have a serious impact on certain operations  and the ability of the company s vendors  suppliers  providers of goods and services  the utility infrastructure power  transport  telecommunications and customers to bring their systems into yk issues compliance

historically  the international portion of the company s sales has been relatively small and the effect of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on the company s earnings generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as unit sales and operating margins 
however  the international segment is expected to grow both in terms of actual sales and as a percentage of the company s total sales and the company may in the future need to revise or change its approach to managing interest rate and foreign currency transactions

the company s other investments in healthcare companies are subject to the wide variety of business risks to which those companies are subject  including generally all of those to which the company is subject  and the lack of liquidity due to the fact that the investments are in non public companies 
the company s policy is to diversify its debt investments among us government obligations  corporate obligations and federal mortgage obligations and to further diversify such portfolio by utilizing a lattered portfolio of maturities for such instruments 
this portion of the company s portfolio primarily matures over the next years see note to the company s consolidated financial statements
