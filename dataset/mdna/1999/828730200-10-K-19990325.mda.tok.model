this includes nonaccrual loans and certain loans identified by management 
non performing loans are comprised of a nonaccrual loans  b loans that are contractually past due days and c other loans for which terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the subsidiary banks recognize income principally on the accrual basis of accounting 
when loans are classified as nonaccrual  the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued 
loans  excluding credit card loans  are placed on a nonaccrual basis either when there are serious doubts regarding the collectability of principal or interest  or when payment of interest or principal is days or more past due and either i not fully secured or ii not in the process of collection 
if a loan is determined by management to be uncollectable  the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for loan losses 
credit card loans are classified as impaired when payment of interest or principal is days past due 
litigation accounts are placed on nonaccrual until such time as deemed uncollectible 
credit card loans are generally charged off when payment of interest or principal exceeds days past due  but are turned over to the credit card recovery department  to be pursued until such time as they are determined  on a case by case basis  to be uncollectable 
at december   impaired loans were million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
at december   non performing loans were million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these increases can be attributed to an increase in credit card loans in bankruptcy and commercial loans that are days or more past due

it is management s practice to review the allowance on a monthly basis to determine whether additional provisions should be made to the allowance after considering the factors noted above

investments and securities the company s securities portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue 
securities within the portfolio are classified as either held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
held to maturity securities  which include any security for which management has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity  are carried at historical cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
premiums and discounts are amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest income using the constant yield method over the period to maturity 
available for sale securities  which include any security for which management has no immediate plans to sell  but which may be sold in the future  are carried at fair value 
realized gains and losses  based on amortized cost of the specific security  are included in other income 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded  net of related income tax effects  in stockholders equity

held to maturity and available for sale investment securities were million and million  respectively  at december   compared to the held to maturity amount of million and available for sale amount of at december  the company s philosophy regarding investments is conservative  based on investment type and maturity 
investments in the held to maturity portfolio include us treasury securities  us government agencies  mortgage backed securities and municipal securities 
as of december   million  or  of the held to maturity securities were invested in us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies  of which will mature in less than five years 
in the available for sale securities  million  or were in us treasury and us government agency securities  of which will mature in less than five years 
in order to reduce the company s income tax burden  an additional million  or  of the held to maturity securities portfolio  was invested in tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions 
there are no securities of any one issuer exceeding ten percent of the company s stockholders equity at december  the company has approximately million  or  in mortgaged backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio 
the company s general policy is not to invest in derivative type investments  except for collateralized mortgage backed securities for which collection of principal and interest is not subordinated to significant superior rights held by others 
as of december   the held to maturity investment portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of  net realized gains from called or sold available for sale securities for were  compared to net realized gains of  in and  in trading securities  which include any security held primarily for near term sale  are carried at fair value

management anticipates that these sources will provide necessary funding in the foreseeable future 
the company s general policy is to avoid the use of brokered deposits 
long term debt the company s long term debt was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the outstanding balance for december  includes million in long term debt and million of trust preferred securities 
this debt was incurred to fund a portion of the purchase price of the acquisitions completed in the company also has assumed million of fhlb long term advances during acquisitions 
capital at december   the total capital reached million  another milestone in the company s history 
capital represents shareholder ownership in the company the book value of assets in excess of liabilities 
at year end  the company s equity to asset ratio was compared to at year end the federal reserve board s risk based guidelines established a risk adjusted ratio  relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures  such as loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
these guidelines place a strong emphasis on tangible stockholders equity as the core element of the capital base  with appropriate recognition of other components of capital 
at december   the tier capital ratio was  while the company s total risk based capital ratio was  both of which exceed the capital minimums established in the risk based capital requirements 
the company s risk based capital ratios at december  and are presented below

at december   undivided profits of the company s subsidiaries were approximately million  of which approximately million was available for the payment of dividends to the company without regulatory approval 
in addition to dividends  other sources of liquidity for the company are the sale of equity securities and the borrowing of funds 
banking subsidiaries generally speaking  the company s banking subsidiaries rely upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash used in investing activities 
typical of most banking companies  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities  such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the banks primary investing activities include loan originations and purchases of investment securities  offset by loan payoffs and investment maturities 
liquidity represents an institution s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors and borrowers  by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds 
a major responsibility of management is to maximize net interest income within prudent liquidity constraints 
internal corporate guidelines have been established to constantly measure liquid assets  as well as relevant ratios concerning earning asset levels and purchased funds 
the management and board of directors of each bank subsidiary monitors these same indicators and makes adjustments as needed 
at year end  each subsidiary bank was within established guidelines and total corporate liquidity remains strong 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  trading and available for sale securities and mortgage loans held for sale were of total assets  as compared to at december  market risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity management continually reviews the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
among the factors considered during its evaluations are changes in the mix of earning assets  growth of earning assets  interest rate spreads and repricing periods 
management forecasts and models the impact of various interest rate fluctuations would have on net interest income 
one such model measures the interest rate sensitivity gap  which presents  at a particular point in time  the matching of interest rate sensitive assets with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the following schedule presents the ratios of cumulative rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities

many computer systems  software  and embedded computer chips may be unable to distinguish between and if not corrected  this problem could create system errors and failure resulting in the disruption of normal business operations 
in  as part of its strategic plan to provide quality customer service  introduce new products  and improve operating efficiencies  the company began converting all of its software and hardware systems to state of the art technology 
as a byproduct of this effort  the year issue was addressed 
state of readiness the company has identified the following three key phases for addressing the year issues analysis  testing  and remediation 
the company has completed the year analysis by identification of mission critical systems  vendors  large borrowers and large depositors requiring assessment and testing 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to test its software systems for year compliance 
at december   the company s internal missions critical testing was approximately complete 
management believes the completion of internal mission critical testing will be completed by march  the testing with vendors  payment system providers and third party suppliers will be completed by june  the replacement of non compliant systems was completed at december  the company expects to substantially complete all phases by june   in accordance with guidelines established by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec 
costs during the year ended december   the company expensed  for software testing and hardware replacement related to the year issues 
the company is utilizing internal personnel to complete all work associated with the year project 
therefore  management believes completion of the year modifications and subsequent testing will not have a material effect on the company s future consolidated results of operations or financial position 
risks although the company s year readiness is directed at reducing it exposure  there can be no assurance that these efforts will fully mitigate the effect of year issues 
in the event the company fails to identify or correct a material year problem  there could be disruptions in normal business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
additionally  the company is subject to credit risk to the extent borrowers fail to adequately address year issues and to liquidity risk to the extent of deposit withdrawals and to the extent its lenders are unable to provide the company with funds due to year issues 
although it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of these risks at this time  in future years  there may be increases in problem loans  credit losses  and liquidity problems  as well as the risk of litigation and potential losses from litigation related to the foregoing 
contingency plans the company has existing disaster recovery plans that address its response to disruptions to business due to natural disasters  civil unrest  utility outages or other occurrences 
the company is in the process of modifying the disaster recovery plans to specifically address year issues 
the company intends to complete these contingency plans by april  during the remainder of  the contingency plans will be tested and validated
