the company sold and or discontinued its investment in each of these operations prior to august  proceeds from the sale of these operations totaled approximately million in net cash and notes receivable of approximately million  which resulted in a net gain on the disposal of million  net of tax 
the results of these operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
revenues of these discontinued operations totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
general the company is the largest supplier of fabricated piping systems in the united states and one of the leading providers of integrated piping systems and services for new construction  site expansion and retrofit projects in the world 
the company was founded in and has expanded rapidly through both internal growth and a series of strategic acquisitions 
most of shaw s operations are conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries  although shaw owns a interest in shaw nass  a joint venture for pipe fabrication in bahrain 
the company provides products and services to customers in the power generation  chemical processing  crude oil refining  petrochemical processing  oil and gas exploration and production and other industries  including pulp and paper  food processing and pharmaceuticals 
the company serves its customers on a worldwide basis and has established a leading market position in the united states as well as select international markets in south america  europe  asia and australia 
as discussed below  financial performance is impacted by the broader economic trends affecting shaw s customers 
all of the major industries in which the company operates are cyclical 
because the company s customers participate in a broad portfolio of industries  its experience has been that downturns in one sector may be mitigated by opportunities in others 
the domestic power generation market currently represents the company s most significant growth opportunity 
despite a softening in the international power generation market  operating results in the fourth quarter of fiscal showed significant additional activity primarily attributable to combined cycle gas turbines being built by general electric 
because the outlook for power generation investments is strong the energy information agency estimates that trillion will be spent globally between and  the company believes that it is well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities 
while its chemical processing and crude oil refining customers have experienced limited growth in recent years  the company continues to experience relatively steady activity in those sectors as its customers complete retrofit and expansion work required to produce new products  modernize aging facilities and meet increasingly stringent environmental requirements 
the petrochemical processing sector accounted for a declining percentage of revenues in as that sector experienced a significant downturn over the past several years 
the company does not expect increased activity in this sector in the near term 
finally  the company entered the oil and gas exploration and production sector in july and expects its activity in this sector to increase after oil and gas companies increase capital spending based on recent increases in the price of oil and gas 
due to increased demand for its services  the company s backlog has increased from million as of august  to million as of august  approximately of this backlog is attributable to the power generation sector  to the chemical processing sector  to the crude oil refining sector  to the oil and gas exploration and production sector and for other industries 
the backlog is largely a reflection of the broader economic trends being experienced by the company s customers and is important in anticipating operational needs 
backlog is not a measure defined in generally accepted accounting principles and the company s backlog may not be comparable to backlog of other companies 
while shaw believes backlog information may be helpful in understanding its business  it is not necessarily indicative of future earnings 
see business forward looking statements and associated risks and business backlog and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investment considerations 
results of operations the following table presents certain income and expense items as a percentage of sales for the years ended august   and year ended august  sales cost of sales gross profit general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations before earnings losses from unconsolidated entity earnings losses from unconsolidated entity income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of tax operating results net gain on disposals net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these variances are discussed below 
the company s sales to customers in the following geographic regions approximated the following amounts and percentages geographic region fiscal fiscal in millions in millions united states far east pacific rim europe south america middle east other revenues from domestic projects increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal increases were experienced in all domestic industry sectors except petrochemical processing 
revenues from international projects decreased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the decline in international sales was primarily attributable to decreases in activity in the power generation sector in the far east pacific region  in the crude oil refining sector in south america and the middle east and in the chemical processing sector in south america 
the company s sales to customers in the following industries approximated the following amounts and percentages industry sector fiscal fiscal in millions in millions power generation chemical processing crude oil refining petrochemical processing oil and gas exploration and production other although total revenues from power generation projects declined in fiscal compared to fiscal  revenues from domestic power generation projects increased nearly for fiscal compared to fiscal due to new domestic power generation projects  including the start up of a previously announced million  five year contract for general electric in august in fiscal  the company experienced a decline in international power generation project revenues  particularly in the far east pacific rim market due to general economic conditions 
revenues associated with international power generation projects declined in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from the chemical processing industry increased in fiscal over the prior year due to increased domestic activity offset in part by decreased international activity 
the decrease in international chemical processing revenues was due primarily to weak activity in the south american region as a result of general economic conditions 
revenues from the crude oil refining industry for fiscal increased over the prior year due to increases in domestic project activity exceeding declines in international project activity 
domestically  activity was positively impacted by a large construction project for a refinery in norco  louisiana that accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal the company experienced a decrease in revenues from international crude oil refining primarily due to weak activity in south america resulting from general economic conditions and recent political events  particularly in venezuela and the middle east 
revenues from the petrochemical processing industry decreased significantly in both the domestic and international markets during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease in revenues from petrochemical processing was primarily attributable to weak global demand 
revenues from the oil and gas exploration and production industry increased in fiscal over fiscal due to the results of a subsidiary that was acquired in july and were partially offset by reductions in oil and gas project work performed by other subsidiaries 
most of revenues from this sector are domestic 
gross profit margin for fiscal increased to from for the prior year 
the gross profit margin was positively impacted by increased revenues from higher margin projects in the domestic power generation  chemical processing and crude oil refining industries 
the overall increase in demand for domestic power generation related projects has had a favorable impact on margins for those projects 
the company anticipates that margins on domestic power generation projects should remain stable provided that the current level of demand remains steady 
shaw has historically realized lower overall margins on erection and construction services because the company generally assumes responsibility for providing all materials and subcontractor costs on these projects 
these costs are typically passed through to the customer with minimal profit recognized 
during fiscal  the company entered into a contract for the expansion of a refinery in norco  louisiana which excluded materials and subcontractor costs from the scope of services 
the company does not expect to continue to enter into erection and construction contracts which exclude a significant amount of customer furnished material or subcontractor costs in the future 
the increase in the gross profit margin was partially offset by continued lower margins on the company s manufactured products due to pricing pressures from foreign imports and lower margins from its foreign operations due to reduced activity in foreign power generation and petrochemical processing industries 
during the second half of fiscal  the company began to experience easing of pricing pressures for foreign imports 
as previously discussed  shaw does not expect to see short term improvements in its various foreign operating locations and anticipates margins will remain unchanged in its foreign operating locations 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal the increase primarily related to growth of erection and construction services and the integration of shaw bagwell  inc  the company s oil and gas services subsidiary  and shaw lancas  ca  the company s venezuelan construction subsidiary  into its business for all of fiscal the company believes that general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will trend downward toward historical levels as revenues from shaw bagwell  inc and shaw lancas  ca increase  but the company cannot be assured that this will occur 
for fiscal  interest expense was million  up million from million in the previous year 
interest expense varies in relation to the balances in  and variable interest rates under  the company s principal revolving line of credit facility  which has generally been used to provide working capital and fund fixed asset purchases and subsidiary acquisitions 
additionally  during fiscal  the company used its line of credit facility to purchase treasury stock totaling million 
the company s effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was due to the reduced amount of foreign export sales and a reduced amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the united states federal rate 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues increased for fiscal to million from million for fiscal gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal approximately million of the increase in revenues related to sales of subsidiaries that the company acquired during fiscal the company s sales to customers in the following geographic regions approximated the following amounts and percentages geographic region fiscal fiscal in millions in millions united states far east pacific rim europe south america middle east other revenues from domestic projects increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal revenues in fiscal from all geographic areas increased over fiscal levels primarily due to continued expansion through acquisitions 
the increase in revenues from europe in fiscal  compared to the prior year  was primarily due to the acquisition of the company s united kingdom operations pipework engineering and development and prospect in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company began streamlining its united kingdom operations 
the company s sales to customers in the following industry sectors approximated the following amounts and percentages industry sector fiscal fiscal in millions in millions power generation chemical processing crude oil refining petrochemical processing oil and gas exploration and production other sales for the petrochemical processing and oil and gas exploration and production sectors are not segregated and are included in the other sectors in the above chart 
revenues from the power generation sector in fiscal increased over the prior year primarily due to increased revenues from the international power generation market 
revenues from the international power generation market increased primarily as a result of the acquisitions of pipework engineering and development and prospect 
domestic power generation revenues also increased primarily due to the expansion of construction services performed by the company s subsidiaries that were acquired in february and march of revenues from the chemical processing sector increased slightly over fiscal as a result of increased activity in both the domestic and international markets 
revenues from the crude oil refining sector for fiscal increased over fiscal due to increased activity in the international markets 
revenues from the petrochemical processing and oil and gas exploration and production sectors were not segregated during fiscal  therefore  explanations of variances are not available 
the decline in other sector revenues in fiscal is the result of a decline in revenues from the company s pipe fabrication and bending operations in due to the substantial completion of a large mining contract in fiscal gross profit margins in fiscal decreased to from for fiscal due primarily to the following factors o a higher volume of pipe erection  maintenance and related construction services work in fiscal  which typically produces a lower gross profit margin  o reduced gross profit margins on the company s manufactured products due to pricing pressure from foreign imports in fiscal  and o lower profit margins realized from the company s united kingdom operations since the acquisition of pipework engineering and development and prospect 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal approximately million of the increase relates to general and administrative expenses of newly acquired subsidiaries  including those owned for only part of fiscal the remaining increase related to increased corporate overhead costs due to the general expansion of its operations 
however  as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million  up from million in fiscal  primarily due to increased borrowings to expand the company s business and to complete the acquisitions of prospect  cojafex  pipework engineering and development and lancas in the company s effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the decrease in the fiscal rates from fiscal was primarily due to additional tax savings from higher foreign export sales and foreign sourced income taxed at lower rates partially offset by lower state income tax incentives and refunds 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations was million for fiscal  compared to net cash used in operations of million for fiscal for fiscal  net cash was favorably impacted primarily by net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  deferred income taxes of million  a decrease in receivables of million and an increase in accrued liabilities of million 
offsetting these positive factors were increases of million in inventories and million in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and decreases of million in accounts payable and million in advanced billings and billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
the decrease in receivables was primarily attributable to increased collection efforts 
the increase in inventory was due to the recent purchase of a large quantity of materials from foreign markets at favorable prices and a higher amount of work in progress inventory at year end due to the increased volume of work on hand  particularly in the company s fabrication facilities 
accounts payables and accrued liabilities changed due to normal operating activities and the timing of receipts and payment of invoices from vendors 
changes in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings  advanced billings and billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts relate to the changes in contractual terms negotiated with customers each year 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  the company purchased million of property and equipment  including million for a new corporate facility in baton rouge  louisiana  million of construction equipment and million of other property and equipment 
during fiscal  the company also embarked on its first significant project financing participation 
in connection with construction and maintenance work on a refinery project in norco  louisiana  shaw acquired million of senior secured notes due december  and shares of preferred stock 
the notes are secured by a first priority security interest in some of the refinery s assets 
through december   the company expects to receive additional notes in lieu of interest 
the investment in the notes was million as of august  this investment represents a one time investment  although the company may from time to time pursue similar investments on a selective basis 
this type of investment will generally be limited in size to the profit expected to be received from the projects and will carry a return that the company believes will reflect the risk inherent in its investment 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million 
in fiscal  in addition to million of purchases of property and equipment  the company invested million  net of cash received  in the pipework engineering and development  prospect  lancas  cojafex and bagwell acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for fiscal  compared to million provided in fiscal net borrowings from the company s revolving lines of credit totaled million in fiscal the company s revolving line of credit has been generally used to provide working capital and fund fixed asset and subsidiary acquisitions 
during fiscal  the company also used its revolving line of credit facility to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock for million including brokerage commissions through open market and block transactions in accordance with a plan adopted by its board of directors 
in september the company s board of directors voted to terminate its stock repurchase plan 
cash was also provided by million of new debt and a million increase in short term liabilities while funds of million were used to repay outstanding debt 
in fiscal  million of cash was provided from the issuance of new debt  primarily million of senior secured notes funded in may the proceeds from the senior secured notes were used primarily to pay down the company s revolving line of credit facility  which had reached a balance of million 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  primarily from the million of new debt  net repayments on the revolving lines of credit of million and the repayment of debt and leases of million 
in september  the maturity date of the company s primary revolving line of credit facility was extended to may  the amendment also modified the interest rate spread not to exceed  at the company s election  over the london interbank offering rate or over the prime rate 
the facility permits the company to borrow up to million in principal amount subject to satisfaction of the conditions to borrowing set forth in the facility 
the facility contains covenants that are customary for revolving loan agreements of this nature 
the credit facility and senior secured notes are equally ranked and are secured by domestic subsidiary accounts receivable  inventory  intangible assets and bank deposits  as well as by the pledge of the capital stock of some of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
the company believes that its current financing arrangements are sufficient to support its operations for the next twelve months 
year compliance the year or yk issue is the result of computerized systems being written to store and process the year portion of dates using two digits rather than four 
date sensitive systems may fail  or produce erroneous results because the year may be interpreted as the year during  the company began implementation of a program to identify  evaluate and address its yk risks to ensure that its information technology systems and non information technology systems are able to process dates from and after january  without critical systems failure 
in addition to evaluating its own systems  the company assessed the yk risks associated with its significant customers and suppliers 
in general  the company s program for identifying  evaluating and addressing its yk risks for all of its systems involved preliminary assessments by its personnel and detail audits and assessments by consultants 
the company completed this phase in the fourth quarter of fiscal total outside costs of approximately  consisting primarily of consultant expenses  were incurred and expensed in fiscal during this evaluation and assessment process 
the company incurred no outside costs in fiscal the company segmented the analysis of its systems into local  national and international categories 
shaw divided each category into major business areas consisting of systems  products  facilities  and suppliers 
the company divided these business areas into smaller categories for data collection and evaluation  such as computers  network equipment  production equipment  manufacturing equipment  alarm systems and phone systems 
the company entered the data into a repository that was created to track evaluation and remediation efforts 
the following is an example of the methodology and results gathered during the company s year program systems shaw identified its proprietary and off the shelf systems during the inventory phases of its yk program 
the company s proprietary software has been remediated and tested for year problems 
year compliant software has been installed on all production systems 
a testing methodology used for these proprietary systems  in an identical but separate environment  was established to evaluate operational functionality and current  future and crossover dates between the years and the company upgraded other business critical off the shelf applications according to the directions of manufacturers to meet year compliance specifications 
products after an inventory and evaluation  shaw believes that the majority of its products are generally not vulnerable to year problems 
design modifications are being implemented to cojafex bending machines  the company s only significant products with imbedded technology  to assure yk compliance of future machines 
the company believes that  while certain reporting functions may be impacted  the production functionality of cojafex machines previously sold will not be adversely affected by yk problems 
facilities the company has evaluated its facilities for yk purposes  including phone systems  hvac  alarm systems  fire systems  elevators and electrical power 
the company evaluated these items because of their potential impact on business operations if they were to fail 
to date  shaw has not discovered that any of its business facilities are materially noncompliant with its yk requirements 
suppliers shaw believes the most likely yk problem that it may experience would be a temporary disruption in certain materials and services provided to it by third parties 
these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company 
shaw has attempted to identify and classify business suppliers based on relevant priority factors and has contacted numerous suppliers and potential suppliers regarding their yk compliance 
shaw believes that it will be able to replace non compliant vendors  however  certain types of raw materials are available from only one or a few specialized suppliers 
to date  the company believes that it has contacted all suppliers material to its operations about their compliance efforts and status 
the company has not discovered any problems that it believes will materially adversely affect it  but the company cannot be assured that problems of this nature will not arise 
current assessment the company will continue its yk contingency planning and compliance monitoring through january based upon the outcome of its assessments and the information derived from its significant customers and suppliers  the company is currently developing contingency plans to address certain risks 
however  the company cannot be assured that it will not be materially adversely affected by yk problems 
shaw also believes that the remaining cost to modify or replace its non compliant systems should not exceed  bringing its total expected yk expenditures paid to outside sources to a maximum of  shaw has incurred approximately  in yk related expenses to date 
the company cannot be assured  however  that such costs will not escalate and materially and negatively impact it 
subsequent event on october   the company filed a registration statement on form s registration no 
with the securities and exchange commission for an offering of million shares of common stock 
managing underwriters for the offering are merrill lynch co  jefferies company  inc  morgan keegan company  inc and rbc dominion securities corporation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information was issued 
sfas requires the company to report financial and descriptive information about its operating segments in its financial statements 
the required disclosures are made for the first time in its fiscal financial statements 
in early  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will require costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
any unamortized costs on the date of adoption of the new standard will be written off and reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
as of august   shaw had total deferred organizational costs of approximately  the company intends to adopt this new requirement in fiscal during fiscal  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in a derivative s fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
which defers the effective date  on september  the company has not yet quantified the impact on its financial statements that may result from adoption of sfas no 
 however  it does not use derivative instruments or hedging activities extensively in its business 
risk factors investing in the company s common stock will provide an investor with an equity ownership interest in the company 
shareholders will be subject to risks inherent in the company s business 
the performance of shaw s shares will reflect the performance of the company s business relative to  among other things  general economic and industry conditions  market conditions and competition 
the value of the investment in the company may increase or decline and could result in a loss 
an investor should carefully consider the following factors as well as other information contained in this form k before deciding to invest in shares of the company s common stock 
this form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risk factors described below and the other factors described elsewhere in this form k 
see business forward looking statements and associated risks 
demand for the company s products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to changes in the economy 
the demand for shaw s products and services depends primarily on the existence of erection and retrofit projects  particularly in the power generation  chemical processing  crude oil refining and petrochemical processing industries 
these industries historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the economy 
the company s results of operations have varied and may continue to vary depending on the demand for future projects from these industries 
for example  demand in the petrochemical processing sector has declined significantly in recent periods 
the dollar amount of the company s backlog  as stated at any given time  is not necessarily indicative of the company s future earnings 
shaw cannot assure you that the revenues projected in the company s backlog will be realized 
to the extent that shaw experiences significant terminations or adjustments in the scope of its projects as reflected in its backlog contracts  the company could be materially adversely affected 
the company defines its backlog as a working backlog  which includes projects for which shaw has received a commitment from its customers 
this commitment takes the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order or a specific indication of the amount of time or material shaw needs to make available for a customer s anticipated project 
in certain instances  the engagement is for a particular product or project for which shaw estimates anticipated revenue  often based on engineering and design specifications that have not been finalized and may be revised over time 
the company s backlog for maintenance work is derived from maintenance contracts and the company s customers historic maintenance requirements 
approximately million  or  of the company s backlog at august  is attributable to a contract with general electric that requires shaw to fabricate of the pipe necessary to install the combined cycle gas turbines to be built by general electric domestically through approximately of this backlog is for power generation projects for which general electric has been engaged and is in various stages of design  engineering and construction  and for which shaw has received a work release or has been notified that a work release is pending 
the balance is for work for which general electric has requested that shaw reserve capacity 
the company cannot be assured that all of these projects will be constructed or that they will be completed in the company s currently anticipated time frame 
on occasion  customers will cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond the company s control 
in the event of project cancellation  shaw may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically has no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in the company s backlog 
in addition  projects may remain in the company s backlog for extended periods of time 
if shaw were to experience significant cancellations or delays of projects in its backlog  the company s financial condition would be significantly adversely affected 
the company s results of operations depend on the company s ability to obtain future contracts 
in the case of large scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain  it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when shaw will receive a contract award 
the uncertainty of the company s contract award timing can present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs 
in some cases  shaw maintains and bears the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than called for under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs under expected contract awards 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  shaw would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on it 
projects in the power generation  chemical processing  crude oil refining and petrochemical processing industries frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process 
because a significant portion of the company s sales is generated from large projects  the company s results of operations can fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
while shaw s revenues are derived from a concentrated customer base  its significant customers vary between years 
the loss of any one or more of the company s key customers could have a material adverse impact on it 
political and economic conditions in countries in which shaw operates could adversely affect the company 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s sales were attributable to projects in international markets 
shaw expects international sales and operations to continue to contribute materially to the company s growth and earnings for the foreseeable future 
international contracts  operations and expansion expose the company to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including o uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which shaw makes capital investments  operates and sells products and services  o the lack of well developed legal systems in some countries in which shaw operates and sells products and services  which could make it difficult for it to enforce the company s contractual rights  o expropriation of property  o restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  and o political risks  including risks of loss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection 
the risks associated with operating internationally are reflected in the recent decrease in the company s international sales from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the economic downturn in the far east pacific rim  resulting in fewer power generation projects  and general economic conditions and political events in south america  causing a reduction in sales to the petrochemical processing sector 
foreign exchange risks may affect the company s ability to realize a profit from certain projects 
while shaw attempts to denominate its contracts in united states dollars  from time to time the company enters into contracts denominated in a foreign currency without escalation provisions 
this practice subjects the company to foreign exchange risks 
foreign exchange controls may also adversely affect the company 
for instance  prior to the lifting of foreign exchange controls in venezuela in november  foreign exchange controls adversely affected the company s ability to repatriate profits from the company s venezuelan subsidiary or otherwise convert local currency into united states dollars 
shaw generally does not obtain insurance for or hedge against foreign exchange risks 
in addition  the company s ability to obtain international contracts is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies 
the nature of shaw s contracts could adversely affect the company 
shaw enters into fixed price or lump sum contracts on a significant number of the company s domestic contracts and substantially all of its international projects 
the company s profit for these projects could decrease  or shaw could experience losses  if the company is unable to secure fixed pricing commitments from its suppliers at the time the contracts are entered into or if shaw experiences cost increases for material or labor during the performance of the contracts 
shaw enters into contractual agreements with customers for some construction services to be performed based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
in some instances  the terms of these contracts provide for the customer s review of the accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in proposed reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the customer 
shaw s dependence on a few specialized suppliers for some of its materials could adversely affect the company 
the company s principal raw materials are carbon steel  stainless steel and other alloy piping  which shaw obtains from a number of domestic and foreign primary steel producers 
to the extent that shaw cannot acquire raw materials  the company s ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be jeopardized 
in addition  if a manufacturer is unable to deliver the materials according to the negotiated terms  shaw may be required to purchase the materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the materials were needed 
the company s projects expose it to potential product liability  warranty claims and liability claims arising from its construction projects 
the company s products are typically installed in large industrial facilities in which system failure can be disastrous 
any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits at locations where the company s products are installed could result in significant product liability or warranty claims against it 
in addition  under some of the company s contracts  shaw must use new metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for its customers 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against the company for significant replacement or reworking costs 
the increasing number of erection and construction projects shaw is performing exposes it to additional risks including cost overruns  equipment failures  personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems 
in addition  once the company s construction is complete  shaw may face claims with respect to the performance of these facilities 
problems integrating acquisitions and managing growth could adversely affect the company 
shaw has experienced substantial growth through internal expansion and acquisitions and plans to pursue select acquisitions in the future 
because the company pursues acquisitions around the world and may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously  shaw may encounter unforeseen expenses  complications and delays  including difficulties in staffing and providing operational and management oversight 
as shaw expands its operations through acquisitions  the company may encounter difficulties integrating acquisitions and successfully managing its growth 
the company cannot give assurance that its current management  personnel and other corporate infrastructure will be adequate to manage its growth or that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support its expanding operations 
to the extent shaw encounters problems in integrating acquisitions and managing its growth  the company could be materially adversely affected 
the company is currently operating at or near full capacity in all of its operating facilities 
the company s production needs will likely exceed its current capacity in the future 
to satisfy the company s production needs  shaw plans to purchase or build additional plants 
the company cannot give assurance that it will complete the acquisition or construction of these plants on a timely basis or at the company s budgeted costs 
the company s competitors may have greater resources and experience than shaw does 
in pipe engineering and fabrication  shaw experiences significant competition from competitors in both international and domestic markets 
in the united states  there are a number of smaller pipe fabricators 
internationally  the company s principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
some of the company s competitors  primarily in the international sector  have greater financial and other resources than shaw does 
in the company s erection  maintenance and related construction services  shaw has numerous regional  national and international competitors  many of which have greater financial and other resources than shaw does 
moreover  shaw is a recent entrant into this business  and many of its competitors also possess substantially greater experience  market knowledge and customer relationships than shaw does 
environmental factors and changes in laws and regulations could increase the company s costs and liabilities 
the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning o emissions into the air  o discharges into waterways  o generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of waste materials  and o health and safety 
these laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for certain pollutants or waste materials and require the company to obtain a permit and comply with various other requirements 
governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on the company  or revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits  for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
in addition  under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  as amended and comparable state laws  shaw may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous substances 
cercla and these comparable state laws typically impose liability without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release  and liability has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis of allocation 
the company s foreign operations are also subject to various requirements governing environmental protection 
the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which shaw are subject are constantly changing  and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on the company in the future 
shaw has not conducted environmental audits of all of its properties 
shaw cannot give any assurance that its operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations will not significantly adversely affect the company 
work stoppages and other labor problems could adversely affect the company 
some of the company s employees in the united states are represented by a union 
shaw experienced a strike  without material impact on production  by union members in february relating to the termination of collective bargaining agreements covering its facilities in walker and prairieville  louisiana 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of the company s facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
from time to time shaw has also experienced attempts to unionize the company s non union shops 
while these efforts have achieved limited success to date  shaw cannot give any assurance that it will not experience additional union activity in the future 
protection of the company s induction pipe bending and software technology is limited and the company s competitors may develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology 
the company s induction pipe bending technology and capabilities impact its ability to compete successfully 
this technology and the company s proprietary software are not currently patented 
while shaw may have some legal protections  litigation brought by the company in this regard could be time consuming and expensive and could prove unsuccessful 
likewise  although shaw protects some proprietary materials and processes through non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  shaw cannot give any assurance that these agreements will not be breached 
finally  there is nothing to prevent the company s competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology 
the company s success depends on key members of its management  including jm bernhard  jr 
the company s success is dependent upon the continued services of j 
m 
bernhard  jr  shaw s founder  chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other key officers 
the loss of mr 
bernhard or other key officers could adversely affect the company 
the company s articles of incorporation and by laws and louisiana law contain provisions that concentrate voting power in management and could discourage a takeover 
at september   the company s officers and directors beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock but  due to the voting provisions described below  controlled in excess of of the voting power 
consequently  these persons  in particular mr 
bernhard  will be able to exercise significant influence over corporate actions and the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote  including the election of directors 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that each share of common stock that has been held by the same person for at least four consecutive years is entitled to five votes on each matter to be voted upon at shareholders meetings  and all shares held for less than four years are entitled to one vote per share for each matter 
this charter provision concentrates control in current management and could o increase the difficulty of removing the incumbent board of directors or management  o diminish the likelihood that a potential buyer would make an offer for the common stock  and o impede a transaction favorable to the interests of some shareholders 
each new purchaser of shares of common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock at all shareholders meetings until the shares have been continuously owned for a period of four years 
after the shares have been continuously owned by the same person for a period of four years  the holder will be entitled to five votes for each share on all matters submitted to shareholders 
in addition  certain provisions of the company s articles of incorporation and by laws  and louisiana law may tend to deter potential unsolicited offers or other efforts to obtain control of us that are not approved by the company s board of directors 
the provisions may deprive the company s shareholders of opportunities to sell shares of common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices 
the company s issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect shareholder rights of a holder of common stock 
the company s board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of the company s shareholders 
in the event that shaw issues preferred stock in the future that has preference over the common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon the company s liquidation  dissolution or winding up  rights as holders of common stock could be adversely affected 
the company s computer systems and those of third parties may not be year compliant  which may cause system failures and disruptions in operations 
the inability of some computer programs and embedded computer chips to distinguish between the year and the year poses a serious threat of business disruption to any organization that utilizes computer technology and computer chip technology in its business systems or equipment 
if the company s information systems fail or if suppliers on which shaw depends for essential goods and services experience information system failures  the company could be materially adversely affected 
the company could face substantial claims by customers  as well as loss of revenues  due to o service interruptions  o inability to fulfill contractual obligations  o inability to account for transactions  and o increased expenses associated with litigation  harm to persons or to property  stabilization of operations following system failures  and the execution of contingency plans 
in addition o shaw depends on third parties  including customers  suppliers and service providers  who may fail to address adequately their year problems  and o shaw relies on automated plant systems  computerized billing procedures and other embedded chip technologies that could necessitate expensive corrective actions 
any or all of these consequences  should they materialize  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
for a more detailed discussion on the state of the company s year readiness  the costs shaw anticipates incurring to become year ready and the company s year contingency plans  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year compliance
