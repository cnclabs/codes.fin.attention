net financial income increased by  to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   an increase of

as of december   fundtech s working capital was  cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits were  and  at december  and  respectively 
fundtech utilized net cash from operations amounting to  for the year ended december  and utilized  for the year ended december  in april  fundtech acquired the checkfree businesses for approximately  in cash  including expenses 
fundtech believes that cash on hand and cash flow from operations  together with the proceeds from this offering  will provide adequate financial resources to finance fundtech s current operations and the planned expansion of its operations for the foreseeable future 
however  in the event that fundtech were to make one or more acquisitions for consideration consisting  in whole or in part of cash  fundtech might be required to seek external debt or equity financing for such acquisition or acquisitions or to fund subsequent operations 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  market risk the dollar cost of fundtech s operations in israel is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is or is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
inflation in israel will have a negative effect on the profitability to fundtech of contracts under which fundtech is to receive payment in dollars or dollar linked nis while incurring expenses in nis linked to the israeli cpi  unless such inflation is offset by a devaluation of the nis 
in and  the rate of inflation in israel was and  respectively  and the devaluation of the nis against the dollar was and  respectively 
this imbalance was reversed during and when the rate of inflation was and  respectively  and the rate of devaluation was and  respectively  resulting in increasing the dollar cost of operating in israel 
however  there can be no assurance that the reversal will continue  that the recent devaluations will not be followed by an increased rate of inflation or that fundtech will not be materially adversely affected in the future if inflation in israel exceeds the devaluation of the nis against the dollar or if the timing of any such devaluation lags behind increases in inflation in israel 
a devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar would have the effect of decreasing the dollar value of any asset of fundtech which consists of nis or receivables payable in nis unless such receivables are linked to the dollar 
such a devaluation would also have the effect of reducing the dollar amount of any expenses or liabilities of fundtech which are payable in nis unless such expenses or payables are linked to the dollar 
conversely  any increase in the value of the nis in relation to the dollar would have the effect of increasing the dollar value of any unlinked nis assets of fundtech and the dollar amounts of any unlinked nis liabilities and expenses of fundtech 
because exchange rates between the nis and the dollar fluctuate continuously albeit with a historically declining trend in the value of the nis  exchange rate fluctuations and especially larger periodic devaluations will have an impact on fundtech s profitability and period to period comparisons of fundtech s results 
such impact is recorded in fundtech s financial statements as financial income or expense 
to date  fundtech has not engaged in currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on fundtech s results of operations 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to identify a given year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may interpret the date code as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in other normal business activities 
we maintain a significant number of computer software programs and operating systems across our entire organization  including various administrative and billing functions  all of which are potentially subject to year problems 
fundtech s year compliance program is divided into two sections software programs licensed to fundtech s customers and internal information technology systems 
phases common to both sections include preparing inventory of all software and hardware items affected by the year issue  assessing the year compliance of identified items  repairing or replacing items that are determined not to be year compliant  testing items  and creating contingency plans 
the software product section of fundtech s compliance program includes all fundtech software products licensed by fundtech s customers 
as of march  substantially all of fundtech s software products had been assessed for year compliance 
the software repair and testing phases began in june the assessment phase will be repeated periodically through january to verify that any changes made to fundtech s existing software do not bring any of fundtech s software components out of year compliance 
the repair and testing steps will be repeated as necessary depending on the outcome of the periodic assessments 
both phases are dependent on the availability of year compliant versions of software from some external vendors 
if fundtech s testing uncovers any material year compliance issues in any widely used versions of our software  it may be necessary for fundtech to upgrade all affected customers to a newer version of fundtech s software which is year compliant 
the infrastructure section of our compliance program consists of hardware and software used by fundtech s staff in the course of operating its business 
we estimate that as of march  this phase was complete 
the repair replacement phase and testing phase are both expected to be completed by june  although both phases are dependent on the availability of year compliant versions of certain software and hardware 
in its review process  fundtech confirmed that a substantial majority of all of its customers  the disruption of whose operations could have a material adverse impact on fundtech s operations  are subject to regulations promulgated by the federal reserve mandating year compliance 
fundtech expects that substantially all such customers will comply with such regulations prior to january  fundtech expects that its employees will perform all significant work for the year project described above 
fundtech does not anticipate hiring any additional employees  nor does fundtech anticipate incurring any significant consulting expenses for the year project 
the cost of software tools and consulting expenses used for detection of year compliance problems and repair of affected software is not currently expected to exceed  contingency planning has not yet begun for either section  but fundtech expects preliminary contingency plans to be completed by june compliance with year requirements may disrupt fundtech s ability to continue developing and marketing its electronic payments and funds transfers and cash and treasury management solutions 
fundtech may also incur certain unexpected expenditures in connection with year compliance 
while uncertainty exists concerning such expenditures  fundtech does not believe that year compliance will result in a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
even if fundtech s products and services are year compliant  the electronic funds transfer products and services used by funds transferring parties not using fundtech s products may not be year compliant  thereby disrupting the ability of fundtech s customers to use fundtech s products for funds transfer transactions with these parties 
furthermore  if funds transfers were unable to be processed by fundtech s customers because of year compliance problems  there can be no assurance that third parties will not commence litigation against fundtech for such funds transfer failure
