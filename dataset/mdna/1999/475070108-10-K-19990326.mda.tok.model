earnings per share assuming dilution increased and 
operating income per share increased and in and operating earnings by business segment reportable segments are determined in a manner consistent with the way management organizes for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance 
invested assets backing insurance liabilities are assigned to segments in relation to policyholder funds and reserves 
net deferred acquisition costs incurred or purchased  reinsurance receivables and communications assets are assigned to segments based on specific identification 
assets are also assigned to back capital allocated to each segment in relation to jp s philosophy for managing business risks  reflecting appropriate conservatism 
a more detailed discussion of operating results by segment follows 
operating income by reportable segment life insurance products annuity and investment products communications corporate and other operating income available to common stockholders net realized investment gains net income available to common stockholders segment assets life insurance products    annuity and investment products    communications corporate and other    total assets    life insurance products the life insurance products life insurance segment offers a wide array of individual and group insurance policies through a career agency force  independent agents recruited through independent marketing organizations and a regional marketing network  home service agents  financial institutions  workplace marketing representatives  and a targeted marketing division 
individual life insurance products include traditional life and health products  as well as universal life ul and variable universal life vul  together referred to as ul type products 
the operating cycle for life insurance products is long term in nature  therefore  actuarial assumptions are important to financial reporting for these policies 
traditional products require the policyholder to pay scheduled premiums over the life of the coverage 
traditional premium receipts are recognized as revenues and profits are expected to emerge in relation thereto 
interest sensitive product premiums may vary over the life of the policy at the discretion of the policyholder and are not recognized as revenues 
rather  revenues and operating income on these products arise from mortality  expense and surrender charges to policyholder fund balances policy charges 
additionally  jp earns interest spreads and investment advisory fees on policyholder fund balances 
operating income for both traditional and ul type products also includes earnings on assigned capital 
group insurance products include life and disability products sold through employers  primarily in the southeastern us it also includes a block of medical policies which are being underwritten by a national managed care company as policy renewal dates arise over the next twelve months  on an as rated basis 
this will result in invested capital formerly assigned to these medical policies being reinvested in other life insurance products or other reportable segments during and  as the company exits the group medical business 
operating results were premiums and other considerations   net investment income total revenues     policy benefits  expenses total benefits and expenses    operating income before income taxes provision for income taxes operating income life insurance recorded increases in operating income of in and in in  individual products contributed a increase while group products improved due to aggressive rate increases and expense management

revenues include traditional insurance premiums  policy charges and investment income 
individual revenues increased in and in due to growth in core businesses from acquisitions and internal growth 
to a large degree  increases in individual revenues are driven by growth in average policyholder fund balances  which increased in and in group revenues declined in and in  because the medical rate increases implemented resulted in non renewals by certain customers 
life insurance traditional insurance premiums declined in due to group medical products and increased in individual traditional premiums improved in and in due in large part to the acquisition of jp financial 
group traditional premiums declined in and in including equivalent premiums on self insured health policies  group premiums were down and 
policy charges improved in and in  in relation to growth in ul type products  especially as a result of the jp financial acquisition 
investment income on assets assigned to the life insurance segment improved and in and  following the growth in segment assets 
total portfolio yields have declined as a result of lower investment rates and credit spreads on new investment opportunities 
the portfolio yield on traditional assets declined basis points in versus basis points in due to effective management of asset liability risks  the average investment spread calculated as the difference between portfolio yields earned on invested assets less interest credited to policyholder funds  assuming the same level of invested assets on ul products decreased basis points in to and remained unchanged in at 
in addition to being impacted by portfolio yields and crediting rates  interest spreads may vary over time due to competitive strategies and changes in product design 
policy benefits declined in  primarily due to group medical products  and increased in  primarily due to the jp financial acquisition 
traditional policy benefits improved to of premiums in versus and in and the improvement is attributable to aggressive rate actions taken to restore the profitability of group medical policies  which also resulted in the decline in premiums and premium equivalents 
as a result of these actions  the group medical incurred loss ratio improved to in versus and in and policy benefits on ul type products improved to of average policyholder funds in versus in and the improvement is due  in approximately equal measure  to favorable mortality and lower credited rates on policyholder accounts 
expenses including the net deferral and amortization of policy acquisition costs increased and in and due to acquisitions 
expenses on individual traditional products were  and of premiums in  and for ul type products  expenses as a percentage of policyholder funds and separate accounts  were  and in  and the improvement in s maintenance expenses is a result of integration savings from the jp financial acquisition 
the increase in is due to the addition of equity based variable products 
for group policies  expenses declined in and increased in the decline was due to management actions to maintain profitability  and due to lower commissions  as revenues declined 
as a percentage of premiums and equivalents  expenses increased to in versus and in and  due to severance benefits and lease cancellation costs associated with the non renewal of health policies 
average life insurance assets grew in  primarily due to ownership of jp financial for all of  sales of ul type products  and growth in existing policyholder funds  from interest credited and equity returns 
average assets grew from internal growth and acquisitions 
the return on average life insurance assets was  and in  and the improvement in relates to the profitable growth of ul type assets and the return to profitability of group health policies 
the decline in is due to diminished group health results and the addition of jp financial equity based variable products

the increases in revenues are primarily related to increases in average policyholder fund balances including separate accounts which grew in and in the increases in policyholder fund balances results from interest credited and new receipts less benefits paid and withdrawals 
the decline in fixed annuity receipts during s low interest rate environment occurred as fixed rate products were perceived less favorably than other fixed interest investments  and as potential customers chose variable annuities on the strength of united states equity markets 
fixed annuity benefits and surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances were  and in  and annuity surrenders may increase in relation to the portion of the business that can be withdrawn by policyholders without incurring a surrender charge 
other income includes concession income earned by jpsc and increased substantially in and  subsequent to jpsc s acquisition as a part of the jp financial acquisition 
policy benefits as a percentage of average policyholder fund balances were  and in  and these declines as well as the declines in premiums are primarily attributable to a reclassification for of certain single premium annuity products as interest sensitive rather than as traditional products 
this reclassification had no effect on operating income 
during and  and of premiums associated with such products were reported as revenues  with similar amounts included in policy benefits 
interest credited represented  and of average policyholder fund balances in  and effective spreads  which represent the yield on the investment portfolio less interest credited to policyholders  adjusted for net deferral of bonus interest and assuming the same level of assets  remained relatively constant at  and for  and this occurred in spite of a decline in portfolio yields to in versus in and in  due to effective asset liability management 
insurance expenses as a percentage of average policyholder fund balances including separate accounts were  and for  and in  expenses were negatively impacted by a one time expense for the relocation of annuity administrative functions to the greensboro home office 
the growth in aip expenses in and was primarily due to broker dealer operations  similar to the increases in other income 
broker dealer expenses  which include commission expense  as a percentage of concession income were  and for  and the percentage for is not comparable because it precedes the jp financial acquisition 
average aip assets increased in in  average assets increased  due largely to the jp financial acquisition 
aip posted returns on average assets of in  in and in the increase is primarily due to earnings of jpsc which were and in and  as well as effective expense management

combined revenues for radio and television grew and in and  respectively 
radio experienced strong revenue growth in  resulting from programming changes made in and increased demand for local advertising 
two of the television stations are cbs affiliates and benefited from robust winter olympic related advertising during first quarter however  television revenues declined for much of as national agency sales continued to be sluggish  consistent with a nationwide trend 
revenue from sports operations decreased during the decline is primarily a result of first quarter factors  including a non recurring sporting event held in the first quarter of and a decrease in collegiate related basketball sales in revenues declined during as a result of non recurring olympic revenues realized in and declines in advertising revenues

total trading securities and debt and equity securities available for sale at december  and were  and investments jp s strategy for managing the insurance investment portfolio is to dependably meet pricing assumptions while achieving the highest possible after tax returns over the long term 
cash flows are invested primarily in fixed income securities 
the nature and quality of the various types of investments held by insurance subsidiaries must comply with state regulatory requirements 
the company has a formal investment policy that governs overall quality and diversification 
jp held the following carrying amounts of investments december  december  publicly issued bonds   privately placed bonds   commercial mortgage loans   common stock policy loans   preferred stock real estate cash and other invested assets total   the strategy of identifying market sectors and niches that provide investment opportunities to meet the portfolios growth  quality and yield requirements is expected to continue to result in increasing percentages of private placements and commercial mortgage loans 
jp s investment policy statement policy requires an average quality fixed income portfolio excluding mortgage loans of a or higher 
currently  the average quality is a  excluding mortgage loans 
the policy also imposes limits on the amount of lower quality investments and requires diversification by issuer and asset type 
the company monitors higher risk investments for compliance with the policy and for proper valuation 
securities that experience other than temporary declines in value are adjusted to net realizable values through a charge to earnings 
commercial mortgage loans in foreclosure are carried at the net present value of expected future cash flows 
the company has established a reserve to account for impaired mortgage loans which was and as of december  and carrying amounts of investments categorized as higher risk assets were december  december  bonds near or in default bonds below investment grade mortgage loans days delinquent or in foreclosure mortgage loans restructured foreclosed properties sub total  higher risk assets all other investments   total cash and investments   the policy permits the use of derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps in conjunction with specific direct investments 
the company s actual use of derivative financial instruments has been limited  using them to manage well defined interest rate risks 
interest rate swaps with a notional value of  and were open as of december   and termination of these arrangements under year end interest rates would result in a gain of the periodic cash settlements under these arrangements are reflected as an adjustment to investment income 
collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  which are included in debt securities available for sale  as of december were federal agency issued cmo s   corporate private labeled cmo s   total   the company s investment strategy with respect to cmo s focuses on actively traded  less volatile issues that produce relatively stable cash flows 
the majority of cmo holdings are sequential tranches of federal agency issuers 
the cmo portfolio has been constructed with underlying mortgage collateral characteristics and structure in order to lower cash flow volatility over a range of interest rate levels 
year issue like most if not all companies  jp faces certain risks associated with the coming of the year the year issue relates to the way computer systems and programs define calendar dates 
by using only two digit dates  they could fail or make miscalculations due to the inability to distinguish between dates in the s and in the s 
also  many systems and equipment that are not typically thought of as computer related referred to as non it contain embedded hardware or software that must handle dates and may not properly perform with dates after the company began work on the year compliance issue in the scope of the project includes ensuring the compliance of all applications  operating systems and hardware on mainframe  pc and lan platforms  addressing issues related to non it embedded software and equipment  and addressing the compliance of key vendors and service providers to the company business partners 
the project has four phases assessment of systems and equipment affected by the year issue  definition of strategies to address affected systems and equipment  remediation of affected systems and equipment  and certification that each is year compliant 
to certify that all it systems internally developed or purchased are year compliant  each system is tested using a standard testing methodology which includes regression testing  millennium testing  millennium leap year testing and cross over year testing 
certification testing is performed on each system as soon as remediation is completed 
the target for completion of all phases and categories is september  the company has completed the assessment and strategy phases for mainframe applications  operating systems and hardware and is executing the remediation and certification phases 
the company s new business and policyholder administration systems and the general ledger are on the mainframe 
the company has determined that approximately of all mainframe systems are compliant 
the company does not deem a system to be compliant until the completion of remediation and certification to confirm that its performance will not be affected by dates extending after with respect to significant policyholder systems  all required remediation has been completed on all systems 
the majority of these systems  including all systems which support products the company is currently marketing  have been certified as year compliant 
completion of certification of remaining systems for some closed blocks of business is expected by april other non policyholder mainframe systems have either been certified or are on schedule 
for pc and lan systems  the company has completed the strategy phases and is executing the assessment  remediation and certification phases concurrently and intends to complete these phases during the third quarter of for the majority of the company s non it related systems and equipment  the company has been advised by vendors that the systems and equipment are currently year compliant 
written documentation regarding compliance is being obtained 
where feasible  certification testing will be conducted for systems and equipment that are material to operations 
some systems and equipment  such as electrical power supply  are not feasible for the company to certify 
completion for non it systems and equipment is scheduled for september the most significant category of key business partners is financial institutions 
their critical functions include safeguarding and managing investment portfolios  processing of the company s operating bank accounts  and sales distribution 
all of the company s business partner financial institutions that have responded to the company s inquiries have indicated they are on schedule for year compliance 
the company continues to follow up with business partner financial institutions that have not yet responded 
other partner categories include insurance agents and marketing organizations  and suppliers of communication services  utilities  materials and supplies 
the company has conducted surveys of all its software and hardware vendors  and certification is underway 
in addition to financial institutions  other critical business partners have been identified and surveys initiated 
results of these surveys are being analyzed in the first quarter of and appropriate testing or other due diligence will be conducted in the second and third quarters of the company has not had an independent review of its year risks or estimates 
however  experts have been engaged to assist in developing estimates and to complete remediation work on specific portions of the project 
since inception of the project  the company has incurred external costs of and internal costs of the current estimate  based on actual experience to date  of total project expense is  with remaining external costs of and internal costs of costs are included in various budgets and expensed as incurred 
expected total costs are less than earlier estimates due in part to refinements in estimates as more projects near completion 
in addition  remediation certification costs on projects completed to date have been lower than originally estimated 
total costs were there has not been a material adverse impact on the company s operations as a result of it projects being deferred due to resource constraints caused by the year project 
the company has investments in publicly and privately placed securities and loans 
the company may be exposed to credit risk to the extent that related borrowers are materially adversely impacted by the year issue 
portfolio diversification reduces the overall risk 
the company is in compliance with the naic securities valuation office s due diligence guidelines for analyzing these risks 
although the company expects to certify that its critical policyholder systems are compliant by the end of april  there is no guarantee that these results will be achieved 
specific factors that give rise to this uncertainty include a possible loss of technical resources to perform the work not yet encountered  failure to identify all susceptible systems  non compliance by third parties whose systems and operations impact the company  and other similar uncertainties 
specifically  from year problems  the company could experience an interruption in its ability to collect and process premiums  process claim payments  safeguard and manage its invested assets and operating cash accounts  accurately maintain policyholder information  accurately maintain accounting records  issue new policies and or perform adequate customer service 
jpcc could experience an inability to broadcast commercial spots and invoice them  or to receive tv network programming 
while the company believes the occurrence of such a situation is unlikely  a possible worst case scenario might include one or more of the company s significant policyholder systems or broadcasting inventory management systems being non compliant 
such an event could result in a material disruption to the company s or jpcc s operations 
should the worst case scenario occur except in jpcc  it could  depending on its duration  have a material impact on the company s results of operations and liquidity and ultimately on its financial position 
although the company is on schedule to complete certification of all internal systems and non it equipment well in advance of january   the company recognizes the need to plan for unanticipated problems resulting from failure of internal systems or equipment or from failures by the company s business partners  providers  suppliers or other critical third parties 
the company has begun work on contingency plans for all mission critical functions 
market risk exposures since jp s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
continued favorable economic conditions in the us contributed to a decline in year us treasury rates of basis points in versus a basis point decline in these forces contributed to an increase in unrealized gains on securities available for sale of and in and further  in  various forces in the fixed income markets resulted in a compression of risk premiums over treasury securities that can be earned on new investments 
in  risk premiums widened significantly in the third and fourth quarters 
in a falling interest rate environment  the risk of prepayment on some fixed income securities increases  causing funds to be reinvested at lower yields 
the company limits this risk by concentrating the fixed income portfolio on non callable securities  through careful selection of cmo s that are structured to minimize cash flow volatility and by purchasing securities that provide for make whole type prepayment fees 
falling interest rates can also impact demand for the company s products  as bank certificates of deposit with no surrender charges and higher average returns from equity markets may become more attractive to new and existing customers 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  competitive pressures may make it difficult for the company to sustain spreads between rates credited on interest sensitive products and portfolio earnings rates  thereby prompting withdrawals by policyholders 
the company manages this risk by adjusting interest crediting rates  at least on an annual basis  with due regard to the yield of its investment portfolio and pricing assumptions and by prudently managing interest rate risk of assets and liabilities 
as is typical in the industry  the company s life and annuity products contain minimum rate guarantees regarding interest credited 
for interest sensitive life products the minimum rates range from approximately to  with an approximate weighted average of 
for annuity products  the minimum rates range from to  with the greatest concentration in the to range 
the company employs various methodologies to manage its exposure to interest rate risks 
the asset liability management process focuses primarily on the management of interest rate risk of the company s insurance operations 
jp monitors the duration of insurance liabilities compared to the duration of assets backing the insurance lines  giving measurement to the optionality of cash flows 
the company s goal in such analysis is to prudently balance profitability and risk for each insurance product category  and for the company as a whole 
at december  and  and of policy liabilities related to interest sensitive portfolios 
the company also considers the timing of cash flows arising from market risk sensitive instruments other than trading and insurance portfolios under varying interest rate scenarios as well as the related impact on reported earnings under those varying scenarios 
market risk sensitive instruments other than trading include debt and equity securities available for sale and held to maturity  mortgage loans  policy loans  investment commitments  annuities in the accumulation phase and periodic payment annuities  commercial paper borrowings  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps  and debt and exchangeable securities 
the following table shows the estimated impact that various hypothetical interest rate scenarios would be expected to have on the company s earnings for a calendar year  based on the assumptions contained in the company s model 
the change in these estimates as of year end versus year end was due primarily to differences in the yield curve and in the sensitivities they introduced to the company s model 
incremental income loss change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points these estimates were derived by modeling estimated cash flows of the company s market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios 
changes in interest rates illustrated above assume parallel shifts in the yield curve graded pro rata over four quarters 
incremental income or loss is net of taxes at 
estimated cash flows produced in the model assume reinvestments representative of jp s current investment strategy and calls prepayments include scheduled maturities as well as those expected to occur when issuers can benefit financially based on the difference between prepayment penalties and new money rates under each scenario 
assumed lapse rates among insurance portfolios give consideration to relationships expected between crediting rates and market interest rates  as well as the level of surrender charges inherent in individual contracts 
the illustrated incremental income or loss also includes the expected impact on amortization of dac and voba 
the model is based on the company s existing business in force as of december  and does not consider new sales of life and annuity products or the potential impact as discussed above of interest rate fluctuations on sales

external trends and forward looking information jp operates largely in the u 
s 
financial services market  which is subject to general economic conditions in the us during and  the us economy exhibited continued favorable trends including low inflation with minimal risk of price increases  moderate business growth and increases in productivity through technological innovation 
however  this environment has resulted in a scarcity of quality investments at favorable yields  in part due to abundant liquidity among corporate borrowers 
also  a robust domestic economy creates pressure on wages for skilled workers 
there are certain secular forces driving economic results including aging of baby boomers  an increase in the supply of investable funds  increased global competition and increasing use of technology 
these forces impact jp in various ways such as demand for its products especially savings oriented products  competition for new investments  mergers and consolidations within the financial services sector and costs inherent in administering complex financial products 
jp has grown at a rate faster than the overall industry because of acquisitions  and its strong financial position  superior claims paying ratings  and efforts to increase distribution sources 
medical trends medical inflation and utilization of medical services affect the profitability of health products offered through the individual and group distribution systems 
in the event that premium rates are not adequately adjusted in anticipation of medical trends  profitability of health insurance products is adversely affected 
jp has elected to non renew its group medical coverages beginning april  but will continue to offer individual and group disability insurance 
environmental liabilities jp is exposed to environmental regulation and litigation as a result of ownership of investment real estate and communications subsidiaries 
actual loss experience has been minimal and exposure to environmental losses is considered by the company to be insignificant 
regulatory and legal environment the us insurance industry has experienced an increasing number of mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of business lines 
these activities have been driven by a need to reduce costs of distribution and by the need to increase economies of scale in the face of growing competition from larger foreign  domestic and mutual insurers  and from non traditional players such as banks  securities brokers and mutual funds 
consolidation is expected to continue and may be heightened by federal legislation 
hr or some variant will likely be passed in congress  perhaps in  and would allow banks  insurance companies and investment banks to affiliate 
the clinton administration has recently recommended billion in new corporate taxes as part of its proposal for next year s budget  and has targeted a substantial share of the new tax burden at the life insurance industry 
several of the administration s proposals which could impact jp include an increase in the dac tax on annuities and life insurance eg life insurance companies are required to defer certain expenses  by formula  attributable to premium revenues from the sale of these products 
a proposal to require recapture of policyholder surplus accounts as taxable income over ten years 
a proposal to place an additional tax on companies that borrow for any purpose if those companies also own life insurance  including key employee insurance 
if adopted  item would result in an increase in current tax liabilities but would not impact earnings except for lost investment income on accelerated tax payments 
item would result in approximately million of additional tax expense over ten years 
item would limit the attractiveness of life insurance policies for corporate policyholders 
jp believes that life insurers already pay higher effective tax rates than the average for corporate america as a whole 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of the administration s proposals at this time 
prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap may vary between states and between companies 
the naic has completed the process of codifying sap codification to promote standardization of methods  and is encouraging each state to adopt codification as soon as possible  with a proposed implementation date of january  related statutory accounting changes are not expected to significantly impact the company s statutory capital requirements  although they are expected to reduce levels of statutory capital industry wide 
assessments by state guaranty associations are made to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated insurance companies 
assessments may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in most states 
the company has accrued for expected assessments net of estimated future premium tax deductions 
in recent years  the life insurance industry has experienced increased litigation in which large jury awards including punitive damages have occurred
