item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands  except property and per share amounts overview gables is a real estate investment trust a reit focused within the multifamily industry in the sunbelt region of the united states 
gables operating performance relies predominantly on net operating income from its apartment communities 
gables net operating income is influenced by operating expenses and rental revenues  which are affected by the supply and demand dynamics within gables markets 
gables performance is also affected by the general availability and cost of capital and by its ability to develop and to acquire additional apartment communities with returns in excess of its blended cost of equity and debt capital 
the company s objective is to increase shareowner value by being a profitable owner and operator of class aa a multifamily apartment communities in the sunbelt region 
to achieve its objective  gables employs a number of business strategies 
first  gables adheres to a strategy of owning and operating class aa a apartment communities which should maintain high levels of occupancy and rental rates 
gables believes that such communities  when supplemented with high quality services and amenities  attract the affluent renter by choice  who is willing to pay a premium for conscientious service and high quality communities 
accordingly  gables communities possess innovative architectural designs and numerous amenities and services that gables believes are desirable by its target customers 
second  gables seeks to grow cash flow from operating communities through innovative  proactive property management that focuses on resident satisfaction and retention  increases in property rents and occupancy levels  and the control of operating expenses through improved economies of scale 
third  gables develops and acquires high quality apartment communities in in fill locations and master planned communities near major employment centers in the sunbelt with the objective of achieving critical mass in the most desirable submarkets 
finally  due to the cyclical nature of the real estate markets  gables has adopted an investment strategy based on strong local presence and expertise  which it believes will allow for growth through acquisition and development as warranted by underlying market fundamentals and will help ensure favorable initial and long term returns 
gables believes the successful execution of these operating and investment strategies will result in operating cash flow growth 
gables believes it is well positioned to continue achieving its objective because of its long established presence as a fully integrated real estate management  development  construction and acquisition company in its markets 
gables believes that its established  local market presence creates a competitive advantage in generating increased cash flow from i property operations during different economic cycles and ii new investment opportunities that involve site selection  market information and requests for entitlements and zoning petitions 
gables markets are geographically independent  rely on diverse economic foundations and have experienced above average job growth 
portfolio wide occupancy levels have remained high and portfolio wide rental rates have continued to increase during each of the last several years 
gables expects portfolio wide rental expenses to increase at a rate slightly ahead of inflation  but less than the increase in property revenues  for the coming twelve months 
in certain situations  management s evaluation of the growth prospects for a specific asset may result in a determination to dispose of the asset 
in this event  management would intend to sell the asset and utilize the net proceeds from any such sale to invest in new assets which are expected to have better growth prospects  reduce indebtedness or  in certain circumstances with appropriate approval from the board of trustees  repurchase outstanding common shares 
gables maintains staffing levels sufficient to meet the existing construction  acquisition  and leasing activities 
if market conditions warrant  management would anticipate adjusting staffing levels to mitigate a negative impact on results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto

management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share amounts gables dividends through the fourth quarter of have been paid from cash provided by operating activities 
gables anticipates that dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis from cash provided by operating activities 
gables has met and expects to continue to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations 
gables net cash provided by operations has been adequate and gables believes that it will continue to be adequate to meet both operating requirements and payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
the budgeted expenditures for improvements and renovations to the communities  in addition to monthly principal amortization payments  are also expected to be funded from net cash provided by operations 
gables anticipates construction and development activities and land purchases will be initially funded primarily through borrowings under its credit facilities described below 
gables expects to meet certain of its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  repayment of short term financing of construction and development activities and possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of debt securities or equity securities  private equity investments in the form of joint ventures  or through the disposition of assets which  in management s evaluation  may no longer meet gables investment requirements 
million credit facility in march   gables closed a million unsecured revolving credit facility 
in may   the million commitment level was increased to million and the maturity date was extended to may  with two one year extension options 
gables availability under the facility is limited to the lesser of the total million commitment or the borrowing base 
the borrowing base available under the facility is based on the value of gables unencumbered real estate assets as compared to the amount of gables unsecured indebtedness 
as of december   gables had million in borrowings outstanding under the facility and  therefore  had million of remaining capacity on the million available commitment 
borrowings currently bear interest at libor plus 
additionally  a competitive bid option feature is in place for up to of the total commitment 
million credit facility in november   gables closed an unsecured revolving credit facility that currently provides for up to million in borrowings 
this facility has an initial term of one year and has unlimited one year extension options 
gables has exercised two of its one year extension options resulting in a maturity date for the facility of october  borrowings currently bear interest under this facility at libor plus 
as of december   gables had no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
restrictive covenants certain of gables debt agreements contain customary representations  covenants and events of default  including covenants which restrict the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions in excess of stated amounts  which in turn restricts the discretion of the company to declare and pay dividends 
in general  during any fiscal year the operating partnership may only distribute up to of the operating partnership s consolidated income available for distribution as defined in the related agreement exclusive of distributions of capital gains for such year 
the applicable debt agreements contain exceptions to these limitations to allow the operating partnership to make any distributions necessary to allow the company to maintain its status as a reit 
gables does not anticipate that this provision will adversely effect the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions or the company to declare dividends  as currently anticipated 
shelf registration statement on december   gables filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to add an additional million of equity capacity and an additional million of debt capacity 
gables believes it is prudent to maintain shelf registration capacity in order to facilitate future capital raising activities 
management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share amounts property sale on march   gables sold an apartment community located in atlanta comprising apartment homes for million 
the net proceeds were initially used to paydown outstanding borrowings under gables credit facilities 
common share repurchase program on march   gables announced a common share repurchase program pursuant to which gables is authorized to purchase up to million of its outstanding common shares 
gables plans to repurchase shares from time to time in open market and privately negotiated transactions  depending on market prices and other conditions  using proceeds from sales of selected assets 
joint venture with jp morgan on march   gables entered into a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of jp morgan investment  inc jp morgan 
the business purpose of the venture is to develop  own and operate seven multifamily apartment communities located in four of gables nine markets  which are expected to comprise  apartment homes 
as of december   gables i had commenced construction of four of the communities  ii owned the land for the future development of two of the communities and iii owned the acquisition right for the land for the future development of one of the communities 
the capital budget for the development of the seven communities is approximately million and is anticipated to be funded with debt and equity 
the equity component will be funded by jp morgan and by gables 
gables portion of the equity will be funded through a contribution of cash and property 
gables will serve as the managing member of the venture and will have responsibility for all day to day operating issues 
gables will also serve as the general contractor during construction and as the property manager 
inflation substantially all of gables leases at its communities are for a term of one year or less  which may enable gables to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases in times of rising prices 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to lessen the impact of cost increases arising from inflation 
book value of assets and shareholders equity the application of historical cost accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap for gables upreit structure results in an understatement of total assets and shareholders equity compared to the amounts that would be recorded via the application of purchase accounting in accordance with gaap had gables not been organized as an upreit 
management believes it is imperative to understand this difference when evaluating the book value of assets and shareholders equity 
the understatement of basis related to this difference in organizational structure at december  is  exclusive of the effect of depreciation 
accordingly  on a pro forma basis  the real estate assets before accumulated depreciation  total assets and total shareholders equity plus minority interest and series z preferred shares at liquidation value as of december  would be   and  respectively  if such  value were reflected 
certain factors affecting future operating results this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  assume and other similar expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which are in some cases beyond the control of gables and may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of gables to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share amounts factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following gables may abandon or fail to secure development opportunities  construction costs of a community may exceed original estimates  construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and reduced rental revenues  occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by local economic and market conditions which are beyond management s control  financing may not be available  or may not be available on favorable terms  gables cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  and existing indebtedness may mature in an unfavorable credit environment  preventing such indebtedness from being refinanced  or  if financed  causing such refinancing to occur on terms that are not as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to consolidated financial statements 
year compliance the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act of the year issue occurs when business application software or embedded microcontrollers use two digits to specify the year  rather than four 
therefore  on january   unless corrections are made  most computers with time sensitive software programs will recognize the year as and may assume that the year is 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations which could result in disruptions of normal business operations 
the year issue can also affect embedded microcontrollers in non computer equipment such as elevators  hvac and security systems 
gables is in the process of assessing the impact of the year issue on its computer systems hardware  software and other equipment with embedded microcontrollers non it 
gables year project is divided into four phases  as described below phase inventory assessment identify all equipment that could potentially be affected by the year issue 
equipment is divided into three categories hardware  software and non it 
phase contact vendors and third party service providers contact the vendors and third party service providers that maintain and or support the equipment identified in phase i to obtain a year compliance certification 
phase determine scope of non compliance based on vendor response and in house testing  assemble a list of items that will not be compliant and prioritize the items to be either replaced or retrofitted 
phase implementation  identification of alternative solutions and testing replace or retrofit items that are not year compliant  identify and implement alternative solutions to items that cannot be replaced or retrofitted  and perform testing thereof 
gables progress is described by category in the following table actual or expected category status phase completion date hardware complete software complete non it working on phase gables costs of addressing the year issue have not been  and are not expected to be  material and will relate primarily to costs of upgrading older equipment  in addition to personnel resource allocation 
however  no estimates can be made as to the potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third party service providers and vendors to prepare for the year issue 
gables has included banks and utilities in its vendor survey  as their services are considered to be mission critical to its business function 
as with other vendors  gables is attempting to attain compliance certification from these vendors to assure that there will be no business interruption to its customers 
management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share amounts on january  based on vendor response and in house testing  gables will develop specific contingency plans  if necessary 
in addition  gables will design a general contingency plan to be implemented in the event of unanticipated equipment and systems failures 
however  there can be no assurance that such plan will be adequate or that failures or delays by third parties in achieving year compliance will not result in material business interruptions  loss of revenues or other adverse effects 
the discussion above regarding gables year project contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
gables assessment of the impact of the year issue may prove to be inaccurate due to a number of factors which cannot be determined with certainty  including the receipt of inaccurate compliance certifications from third party vendors  inaccurate testing or assessments by gables personnel of its equipment or systems  and inaccurate projections by gables of the cost of remediation and or replacement of affected equipment and systems 
a failure by gables to adequately remediate or replace affected equipment or systems due to the factors cited above or for other reasons  a material increase in the actual cost of such remediation or replacement  or a failure by a third party vendor to remediate year problems in systems that are vital to the operation of gables properties or financial systems  could cause a material disruption to its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
management s discussion and analysis amounts in thousands  except property and per share amounts supplemental discussion funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations gables considers funds from operations ffo to be a useful performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
gables believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report 
gables computes ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo as defined by nareit represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of assets or debt restructuring  plus certain non cash items  primarily real estate depreciation  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  extraordinary or unusual items  along with significant non recurring events that materially distort the comparative measure of ffo are typically disregarded in its calculation 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  gables ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the nareit definition 
adjusted funds from operations affo is defined as ffo less recurring  non revenue enhancing  capital expenditures 
ffo and affo should not be considered as alternatives to net income as indicators of gables operating performance or as alternatives to cash flows as measures of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all of gables cash needs including principal amortization  capital expenditures  and distributions to shareholders and unitholders 
additionally  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reference is made to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of gables cash needs and cash flows 
a reconciliation of ffo and affo follows years ended december  net income available to common shareholders   extraordinary loss  net of minority interest minority interest of common unitholders in operating   partnership loss on treasury locks a   amortization of loss on extension of used treasury locks gain on sale of real estate assets  real estate asset depreciation wholly owned real estate assets   joint venture real estate assets total   funds from operations basic   amortization of discount on long term liability b funds from operations diluted   capital expenditures for operating apartment communities carpet   roofing exterior painting appliances other additions and improvements   total   adjusted funds from operations diluted   average common shares and units outstanding basic   average common shares and units outstanding diluted   a this item is disregarded in the calculation of ffo as it represents a significant non recurring event that materially distorts the comparative measurement of gables performance over time 
while gables may utilize derivative financial instruments  such as rate locks  to hedge interest rate exposure by modifying the interest rate characteristics of prospective financing transactions  it believes the events and circumstances that resulted in these losses are non recurring in nature

such units are excluded from basic shares and units outstanding  but are included in the calculation of diluted shares and units outstanding
