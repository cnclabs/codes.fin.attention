the company can elect to redeem these shares anytime after march  the redemption rights of the shareholders and the related restrictions are effectively the same as for the series b preferred shares 
the proceeds of these offerings were used to pay down variable rate debt  to fund acquisition and new development activity and to retire million of secured notes payable to an insurance company 
the early extinguishment of the million of secured notes in february of that were scheduled to mature in august of resulted in an extraordinary loss of million

the company has three interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million which fix interest rates on variable rate debt at and expire through total debt outstanding increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily to fund acquisitions and new development 
continued growth through acquisitions and new development will eventually necessitate the need for additional capital 
the company will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider its available alternatives  including both public and private placements 
during  the company s million unsecured revolving credit facility was amended to improve the pricing and  effectively  extend the term of the commitment

in the second quarter of  the company filed a million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which includes million from the company s prior shelf registration which allows for the issuance of debt  equity securities or warrants 
at december   amounts available under the shelf registration totaled million  however  this amount was reduced by million due to the issuance of series c preferred shares subsequent to year end 
the company intends to amend the shelf registration in early to increase the amount available by million 
during  the company sold its investment in us government agency guaranteed pass through certificates for million  resulting in a gain of less than 
million 
the proceeds from the sale were used primarily to retire overnight repurchase agreements  which were collateralized by these marketable debt securities 
market risk the company uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance its capital requirements 
these transactions expose the company to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk 
during  the company entered into and settled three forward treasury lock agreements with a total notional amount of million as a hedge against potential changes in interest rates of prospective issuances of fixed rate debt 
amounts paid or received upon settlement of these contracts are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the fixed rate debt 
at year end  the company had a deferred loss of million which will be amortized over the life of the next million of fixed rate debt issues 
at december   the company had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps 
in the event that interest rates were to increase basis points  the fair value of fixed rate debt would decrease by million and net income  funds from operations and future cash flows would decrease 
million based upon the debt outstanding at december  following the issuance of the series c preferred shares in january of and the related retirement of the variable rate medium term notes  all variable rate debt other than that covered by the interest rate swaps was eliminated 
funds from operations funds from operations is an alternate measure of the performance of an equity reit since such measure does not recognize depreciation and amortization of real estate assets as operating expenses 
management believes that reductions for these charges are not meaningful in evaluating income producing real estate  which historically has not depreciated 
the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  less gains and losses on sales of properties 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations increased to million in  as compared to million in and million in these increases relate primarily to the impact of the company s acquisitions and new developments and  to a lesser degree  the activity at its existing properties 
for further information on changes between years  see results of operations below 
results of operations rental revenues increased  or million  from million in to million in and by  or million  from million in these increases are primarily the result of the company s acquisition and new development programs 
occupancy of the company s shopping centers and total portfolio increased to at december  from at the end of the company s industrial portfolio occupancy was at december  and the company completed renewals or leases comprising million square feet at an average rental rate increase of 
net of the amortized portion of capital costs for tenant improvements  the increase averaged 
interest income totaled million in  million in and million in this decrease in income is primarily the result of the company selling million of its marketable debt securities during the first quarter of offset by interest earned on the investment of excess cash balances resulting from the company s preferred share offerings 
equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures and partnerships totaled 
million in  million in and million in the decrease in is due to the company s purchase at december  of its joint venture partner s interest in four shopping centers 
direct costs and expenses of operating the company s properties ie  operating and ad valorem tax expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these increases are primarily due to property acquired and developed during these periods 
overall  direct operating costs and expenses as a percentage of rental revenues were in and in and depreciation and amortization have increased to million in from million in and million in  also as a result of the properties acquired and developed during these periods 
general and administrative expense have increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in results primarily from the company s adoption of a new emerging issues task force consensus decision which provides that internal costs of identifying and acquiring operating property incurred subsequent to march  should be expensed 
the company realized an increase in expense of million in due to the adoption of this standard 
gross interest costs  before capitalization of interest to development projects  increased by million from million in to million in this increase in interest cost was due mainly to the increase in the average debt outstanding from million for to million for the weighted average interest rate decreased from in to in interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  increased million from the amount of interest capitalized increased to million in from 
million in due to an increase in the amount of development activity during the year 
included in interest expense during was 
million related to repurchase agreements which were collateralized by the company s investment in marketable debt securities which were sold during the first quarter of comparing to  gross interest costs increased from million in to million in this was due to an increase in the average debt outstanding from million in to million in the weighted average interest rate decreased slightly between the two periods from in to in interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  increased million from due to an increase in the amount of development activity during the year 
the gain on sale of 
million in was due primarily to the sale of its joint venture interest in an apartment project located in san antonio  texas and the sale of excess land associated with the company s investment in the development of a retail center in denver  colorado 
the gain on sale of million in was primarily due to the condemnation of a portion of a shopping center by the state of texas 
the company leased back the portion of the shopping center purchased by the state  and continues to operate the center 
effects of inflation the rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in the company has structured its leases  however  in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby the company receives rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows the company to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon the company s operating results 
new accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities was issued 
this statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure the instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends upon its intended use 
the company will adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal year the company is still evaluating the effects of adopting this statement 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to be amended to allow the system to distinguish st century dates from the th century dates 
the use of software and computer systems that are not year compliant could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with year requirements 
the company has completed a review of its software and hardware and determined that all mission critical systems are year compliant 
non mission critical software and hardware have also been reviewed and the company has identified certain personal computers  local area networks and file servers which are scheduled for upgrades or replacement as part of the company s ongoing maintenance of its information system technology 
the company has also completed a review of year issues not related to information technology including  but not limited to  the use of imbedded chips or internal clocks in machinery or equipment 
as the company owns primarily single story industrial buildings and neighborhood retail centers without enclosed common areas  the use of this technology is very limited and  accordingly  the company believes that it is year compliant 
the company has no incremental costs in addressing these year issues 
the company has communicated with its major tenants  financial institutions and utility companies to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to third parties failures to resolve their year issues 
based on the representations received from these third parties  the company does not believe this represents a material risk to the company 
nevertheless  the company has no guarantee that such third party systems will operate as represented 
in the event significant systems of one of these third parties fails  the operating results and financial condition of the company could be adversely effected 
based on the company s assessment of the readiness of its own systems and those of significant third parties  it has not deemed it necessary to develop a formal contingency plan 
in the event additional information comes to the company s attention which would change its current assessment  it will consider the need for a contingency plan at that time 
forward looking statements this annual report includes certain forward looking statements reflecting the company s expectations in the near term that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  however  many factors may materially affect the actual results  including demand for our properties  changes in rental and occupancy rates  changes in property operating costs  interest rate fluctuations  and changes in local and general economic conditions 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company s expectations will be realized
