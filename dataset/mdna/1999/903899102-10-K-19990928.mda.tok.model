newly issued accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet either as an asset or liability measured at its fair value  and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
this statement is to be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet determined the impact of adopting sfas no 
on its financial statements 
however  given the current level of the company s derivative and hedging activities  the impact is not expected to be material 
year compliance 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using only two digits as opposed to four to represent the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize as the year rather than the year this could potentially result in a system failure or an error in calculation 
this year issue is believed to affect all companies and organizations  including the company 
the company is taking a number of steps in an effort to assess its readiness for year issues  including reviewing all business systems  testing equipment  surveying key material suppliers  and completing the remediation plan 
during fiscal  the company s review and assessment determined that its us accounting system was not year compliant 
as part of its ongoing project to improve the flow of management information and control of operations  the company implemented and began using an enterprise wide software system as of july  the company now believes that its systems are fully year compliant 
the total costs of this project  including hardware  software  consulting and implementation costs  amounted to approximately  most of these costs were capitalized 
in addition to internal year activities  the company is in contact with its key suppliers and vendors to assess their state of readiness and compliance 
the company has issued documentation to key vendors and suppliers and is receiving assurances from these companies that all new equipment purchased is year compliant  and that the supply of materials necessary to the continued smooth operation of the company will not be materially affected by any year issues 
however  it is difficult to predict with certainty what the impact on the company may be as a result of any year problems at its vendors and suppliers 
the company believes that the cost of completing the assessment and remediation plan will not be material and that the risks to the company with respect to year issues are manageable 
management is continuing to examine the year issues as they potentially impact the company and is finalizing contingency plans as necessary 
us army contract 
on april   the company announced that it had been awarded a million sole source contract to provide primary disposable batteries to the us army 
the contract was awarded by the us army communications and electronics command cecom in ft
