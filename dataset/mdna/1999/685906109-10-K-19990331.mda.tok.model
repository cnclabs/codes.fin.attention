further information on the company  our lead product and our pipeline is contained in the business section of this form k 
overview of organogenesis inc 
organogenesis designs  develops and manufactures medical therapeutics containing living cells and or natural connective tissue 
the company was formed to advance and apply the emerging field of tissue engineering to major medical needs 
our product development focus includes living tissue replacements  cell based organ assist devices and other tissue engineered products 
our lead product  apligraf on may   our lead product  apligraf living skin construct  was approved for marketing in the us 
apligraf is the only mass manufactured product containing living human cells to be approved for marketing through the fda pma process 
novartis pharmaceuticals corporation launched apligraf in the us in june novartis pharma ag has global apligraf marketing rights and also markets apligraf in canada 
novartis marketing strategy is to first establish apligraf as the new standard of care for venous leg ulcers 
the next potential large market for apligraf is expected to be diabetic ulcers 
patient enrollment in the apligraf diabetic ulcer pivotal trial was completed in november  we plan to submit a pma supplement to the fda within the next twelve months 
an apligraf study in burns has been completed  data from this study was presented in february two studies in skin surgery have been completed and their data has been or is expected to be published 
a multicenter  controlled apligraf pivotal trial studying the cosmetic outcome of wounds due to skin cancer removal is underway 
we also plan to initiate a study in pressure sores 
a study is underway for epidermolysis bullosa through an investigator sponsored investigational device exemption 
our pipeline our pipeline includes vitrix soft tissue replacement product  a bioartificial liver and a vascular graft  as well as the graftpatch and engineered collagen fibril technology out licensing opportunities 
we have an active and expanding business development program related to our products and technologies 
results of operations with the approval and launch of apligraf  we began a new era of operations 
we are seeing  as expected  a gradual ramp up in sales 
we expect production costs to exceed product sales for the near term due to start up expenses and the high costs associated with low volume production 
however  we expect production volume to increase 
revenue total revenues for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
these amounts consist of r d support and milestone payments    product sales  royalties  and other income    interest income    the year over year increase in product sales  royalties and other income is mainly due to sale of product to novartis  including product to support the canadian and us launches of apligraf 
apligraf commercial sales for the fourth quarter increased from the third quarter 
we expect apligraf commercial sales to continue to increase 
novartis expects to launch apligraf in selected european countries in r d support payments are recognized when earned 
the year over year changes in interest income are primarily due to the difference in funds available for investment 
expenses research and development expenses our r d expenses consist of costs associated with research  development  clinical  quality systems and operations 
r d expenses increased to  for from  in and  in the increase in was primarily due to clinical trials activity  including the apligraf diabetic ulcer pivotal trial and non recurring expenses related to fda approval  progressing preclinical programs  including the vitrix soft tissue replacement product  and investing in manufacturing operations  including personnel additions 
the increase in was primarily due to personnel additions  mainly in operations and clinical research  expansion of facilities  resulting in higher non cash depreciation charges and increased occupancy costs  and other activities supporting our research and development programs  including the apligraf diabetic ulcer pivotal trial and the engineered collagen fibrils and bioartificial liver research programs 
we expect to continue to expand apligraf manufacturing operations and to advance our pipeline during the next months 
the majority of our funding continues to be used for r d and operating activities 
general and administrative expenses our g a expenses include the costs of our corporate  investor public relations  finance  information technology and human resource functions 
g a expenses increased to  for from  in and  in the increase is primarily due to adding support staff and higher consulting and professional services  partially relating to regulatory related activities that are nonrecurring 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the use of outside services 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs 
additionally  in may  we incurred a one time  non cash compensation charge of  relating to the extension of the term of a stock option held by an officer 
we continue to manage g a expenses at a relatively steady to decreasing percent of total expenditures and expect the growth in g a expenses to increase at a slower rate 

chart appears here 
net income we incurred a net loss of  or 
per share basic and diluted for  compared to a net loss of  including the  non cash charge  or 
per share basic and diluted for and a net loss of  or 
per share basic and diluted for we may incur additional losses as expenditures continue to increase due to expansion of operations and research programs 
capital resources and liquidity funds used in operations at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in the aggregate amount of  and working capital of  compared to  and  respectively  at december  cash equivalents consist of money market funds  which are highly liquid and have original maturities of less than three months 
investments consist of securities that have an a or a rating or better with a maximum maturity of two years 
cash used in operating activities was  in and  in  primarily for financing our ongoing research  development and manufacturing operations 
capital spending capital expenditures were  and  during and  respectively  primarily related to further build out of the current facilities to support apligraf manufacturing and the acquisition of laboratory equipment for expanded research and development programs 
we will continue to utilize funds during to expand our current facility in the areas of apligraf manufacturing  quality systems labs and packaging 
we also plan to add a second facility in the future to enable further expansion 
novartis support the collaborative agreement with novartis provides us with up to  in equity investments  research support and milestone payments  of which  was received during   in and  in the remaining payments are based upon achievement of specified events 
under the agreement  we supply novartis global requirements for apligraf and receive revenue consisting of a per unit manufacturing payment and royalties on product sales 
taxes at december   we had federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  these losses and tax credits are available to reduce federal and state taxable income and income taxes  respectively  in future years  if any 
however  the realizability of deferred tax assets is not assured as it depends upon future taxable income 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against these assets 
we are required to recognize all or a portion of net deferred tax assets  with corresponding increases to net income  when we believe  given the weight of all available evidence  that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and other credits will be realized 
however  there can be no assurance that we will ever realize any future cash flows or benefits from these losses and tax credits 
ownership changes may result in future limitations on the utilization of net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
financing from inception  we have financed our operations substantially through private and public placements of equity securities  as well as receipt of research support and contract revenues  interest income from investments  sale of products and receipt of royalties 
during  financing activities provided additional cash and working capital from the sale of shares of series c convertible preferred stock that generated net proceeds of approximately  equity investments totaling  from novartis  and the exercise of stock options of  partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock totaling  the repurchased stock will provide us with treasury shares for general corporate purposes 
financing activities provided cash of approximately  during from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
at december   we had approximately shares of series c convertible preferred stock outstanding 
in the event that any series c preferred stock are outstanding on the mandatory conversion date of march   we have the option of redeeming any such outstanding series c preferred stock by paying cash equal to the product of the number of series c preferred stock outstanding multiplied by the stated value of  per share  issuing common stock equal to of the stated value divided by the average of the closing bid prices for the consecutive trading days prior to the mandatory conversion date  or any combination of these methods 
on march   we closed a financing of  through the private placement of five year convertible debentures and  warrants to purchase common stock 
we may raise up to approximately  additional under this placement 
the debentures are convertible at a fixed price of per share at any time on or after march  interest on the debentures accrues at annually  payable in cash  common stock at the average trading price for the twenty trading days preceding the due date or any combination thereof  at our option  semi annually on september and march or on the date any of the principal outstanding under the notes has been converted into common stock 
at our option  at any time on or after march   the debentures may be prepaid by conversion of the principal into common stock at the conversion price of  cash or any combination thereof and payment of any accrued interest as described above  provided that the average per share market value for the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of prepayment equals or exceeds per share 
the notes mature on march  and are payable in cash 
the warrants grant the right to purchase one share of common stock at the exercise price of for each in face value of the convertible notes at any time before march  we expect to register the warrants and underlying common stock for conversion of the debentures  payment of interest and exercise of the warrants 
liquidity and other risk factors based upon our current plans  we believe that the convertible debt financing completed subsequent to december   together with existing working capital and future funds from novartis  including product and royalty revenue  will be sufficient to finance operations into however  this statement is forward looking and changes may occur that would significantly decrease available cash before such time 
factors that may change our cash requirements include 
time required to obtain regulatory approvals of products in different countries  if needed  and subsequent timing of product launches  
commercial acceptance and reimbursement when product launches occur  
progress of research and development programs  resources devoted to outside research collaborations or projects  self funded projects  proprietary manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  and 
acquisition of a second manufacturing plant 
any of these events could adversely impact our capital resources  requiring us to raise additional funds 
additional funds may not be available when required on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  we would need to delay  scale back or eliminate certain research and development programs or license to third parties certain products or technologies that we would otherwise undertake ourselves  resulting in a potential material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
year the year issue yk refers to potential problems with computer systems or any equipment with computer chips or software that use dates where the year has been stored as just two digits e 
g  for 
on january   any clock or date recording mechanism incorporating date sensitive software which uses two digits to represent the year may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to manufacture product or process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar business activities 
state of readiness in order to address this situation  we conducted an assessment to identify and determine the yk readiness of our systems 
this assessment program focused on three main functional areas  including 
information technology which addresses data  phone and administrative systems  
embedded chip technology which addresses manufacturing systems  laboratory instruments and plant maintenance systems with programmable logic controllers with date functions  and 
material suppliers  vendors and other third parties that address areas that are critical to the manufacturing process  distribution of product or other business processes 
the task of assessment from a yk readiness perspective is complete 
some of our systems are yk compliant  whereas other systems have been identified as not being yk compliant and remedial action is underway 
remedial plans have been developed for the remaining software and systems to bring them into yk compliance in time to minimize any detrimental effects on operations 
in addition to the assessment of systems  key vendors  suppliers and other third parties were identified and a survey form was sent to each of these business entities to determine if their systems are yk compliant 
we are monitoring responses as they are received 
yk issues with our vendors  suppliers or other third parties could delay the shipment and receipt of critical supplies  potentially impacting production and operations 
we are proactively addressing the yk issue with vendors  suppliers and other third parties to minimize risk from these external factors 
cost of year compliance and contingency plans while our yk project is not yet complete  we currently estimate that costs associated with the yk issue will be no more than  which includes the use of internal resources 
working capital will be used to fund these costs 
to date  costs consist primarily of payroll costs for existing employees  including the information technology group  which are not separately tracked  as well as certain software upgrade and training costs 
however  certain aspects of the yk assessment are still ongoing 
if we or key third parties such as suppliers and customers are not yk ready  there could be an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that with the implementation of the yk program the risk of significant interruptions of normal operations is reduced 
we are developing a contingency plan to address a situation in which yk problems do cause an interruption in normal business activities 
once developed  contingency plans and related cost estimates will be continually refined as additional information becomes available 
accounting pronouncements in march of  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires computer software costs associated with internal use software to be charged to operations as incurred until certain capitalization criteria are met 
sop is effective beginning january  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material effect on consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning december  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on consolidated financial position or results of operations
