million

cash provided by operations also included million from an income tax refund and related interest  of which million was applied as required to the redemption of the corporation s series a redeemable preferred stock 
these increases were partially offset by additional capital requirements for three significant construction joint ventures in the heavy civil construction group 
cash provided or used from operating activities from period to period is affected to a large extent by the mix  timing  state of completion and commercial terms of engineering and construction contracts which is reflected in changes in net operating assets and liabilities 
the corporation anticipates that the execution of existing backlog can be managed through future operating cash flows and available cash and cash equivalents without need for additional capital resources 
net cash used for investing activities in of million included net million of property and equipment acquisitions  the net purchase of million of securities available for sale in connection with the corporation s self insured risk management program and million primarily for the purchase of a ready mix concrete business offset by million in cash proceeds from the sale of a non core business

as discussed in note acquisition of westinghouse businesses  the corporation intends to fund its share of the purchase price for certain businesses presently owned and operated by cbs corporation and its share of the working capital requirements of such businesses using existing financing facilities  additional financing facilities for which the corporation has received commitments or an offering of senior unsecured notes  together with cash on hand and cash from other operations 
the terms of such additional borrowings have not yet been finalized 
the corporation may  from time to time  pursue opportunities to complement existing operations through business combinations and participation in ventures  which may require additional financing and utilization of the corporation s capital resources 
the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs written and electronic circuitry that use two digits rather than four to define calendar years 
these programs may fail to properly differentiate between calendar years in the twenty first century and calendar years in the twentieth century eg  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year 
if not corrected  the year issue could result in complete system failures or miscalculations causing significant disruption of normal business activities 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations  including the corporation 
the corporation employs a number of information technology it systems in its operations including  without limitation  computer networking systems  financial systems and other similar systems 
throughout its operations  the corporation also employs numerous non it devices such as building security and safety devices and other devices containing embedded electronic circuits 
both it systems and non it devices are subject to potential failure or error due to the year issue 
the corporation has developed and implemented a strategic plan the year project to achieve year readiness 
the year project s activities are intended to remediate the year issue in all major categories of systems and electronic devices in use by the corporation  including it systems  non it devices and supply chain relationships so that the corporation may continue its operations without interruption or with minimal disruption 
it also includes communication with critical third parties such as clients  vendors  subcontractors and other business partners to determine the expected degree of year compliance of those parties  and to monitor their progress towards year readiness 
the year project includes the following phases awareness  inventory  assessment  remediation  testing validation and return to production 
progress reports on the year project are presented regularly to the corporation s senior management and periodically to the audit committee of the board of directors 
because of the scope of its operations  the corporation believes it is impractical to seek to eliminate all potential year problems before they arise 
as a result  the corporation expects that its year assessments and corrections will include ongoing remedial efforts into the year the corporation is using a risk based analysis of ii its operations to identify those items that are critical to the corporation and at risk 
critical items are being identified through the inventory phase of the year project 
the corporation is in various inventory  assessment and remediation phases with regard to its state of readiness related to non it devices containing embedded circuitry and issues related to third parties with whom the corporation has material relationships 
the corporation is in various states of the inventory  assessment  remediation and testing validation phases with regard to its it systems 
as part of the year project regarding it systems  the corporation continues implementing new or upgraded year compliant systems for financial information  human resources and payroll 
these systems are expected to be completed in july  the corporation is corresponding with its major clients and joint venture and other business partners  and with all vendors and subcontractors that have been determined  through practical risk assessment techniques  to be critical to the corporation  in order to determine the year readiness or progress of those entities and to assess any related risks 
as part of the year project  the corporation is exploring alternative solutions and developing contingency plans to address the possibility that the corporation and third parties with whom it has material relationships will not be fully year ready on a timely basis 
such plans have not yet been fully developed  and the corporation will continue to develop them as necessary to address each area of year risk 
completion of the year project  including the development of contingency plans  is expected by september  the corporation s year project utilizes both internal and external resources 
the total cost of the corporation s activities to achieve year readiness is currently estimated at approximately million 
as of november   the direct costs incurred by the corporation to remediate year issues were approximately million 
although the corporation believes that its year readiness efforts are designed to appropriately identify and address those year issues that are within the corporation s control  there can be no assurance that the corporation s efforts will be fully effective 
the newness and complexity of the issues presented and the corporation s dependence on the technical skills and preparedness of third parties are among the factors that could cause the corporation s efforts to be less than fully effective 
moreover  year issues present many risks that are simply beyond the corporation s control  such as the potential effects of year issues on the economy in general and on the corporation s business partners  vendors  subcontractors and customers in particular 
while the corporation believes that the impact of any individual year failure will most likely be localized and limited to specific facilities or operations  the corporation is not yet able to assess the likelihood of significant business interruptions occurring in one or more of its operations around the world 
such interruptions could prevent the corporation  at least temporarily  from delivering contractual services 
furthermore  it has been widely reported that significant litigation is expected to occur related to business interruptions caused by year failures 
it is uncertain whether  or to what extent  the corporation will be affected by such litigation 
the failure of the corporation  its clients including us government agencies  vendors  joint venture partners or others upon whom the corporation relies to achieve year readiness could adversely affect the corporation s business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the foregoing disclosure is based upon the corporation s current expectations  estimates and projections  which could ultimately be found to be inaccurate 
because of uncertainties and circumstances beyond the corporation s control  the actual effects of year issues on the corporation may be different than the foregoing assessment 
see note regarding forward looking information 
environmental contingency from july to june  a subsidiary of the corporation performed certain contract mining services at the ii summitville mine near del norte  colorado 
the epa has notified the corporation and approximately other parties that each is a potentially responsible party prp with regard to hazardous substances generated or disposed of at the summitville mine superfund site site 
the epa has not commenced any litigation or other proceedings against the corporation 
the corporation has had only preliminary discussions with the epa but has been informally advised that the epa does not consider the corporation eligible for a de minimis settlement the basis for settlement by several prps considered to have contributed less than volume and toxicity of the hazardous substances at the site 
according to a report published in august  the epa estimated that the total remediation costs incurred and to be incurred at the site will be million 
the corporation is not a party to any agreement regarding an allocation of responsibility  and the epa has not made an allocation of responsibility among the prps 
the corporation s share  if any  of the aggregate environmental liability associated with the site is not presently determinable and depends upon  among other things  the manner in which liability may be allocated to or among the corporation or other prps associated with the site  the efficacy of any defenses that the corporation or such other prps may have to any assertion of liability  the willingness and ability of such other prps to discharge such liability as may be allocated to them and the outcome of any negotiations or settlement discussions between the corporation and the epa and or such other prps 
accordingly  no remediation costs have been accrued at november  management believes that the ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial position and could materially and adversely effect its results of operations and cash flows in one or more periods
