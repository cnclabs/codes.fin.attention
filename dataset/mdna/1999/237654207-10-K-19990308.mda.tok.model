the company s clients consist primarily of large business and governmental organizations 
although the company believes that demand for year consulting services will continue after the year  this demand is likely to diminish significantly 
therefore  the company is pursuing opportunities in the computer consulting market that are not related to the year problem and has developed strategies and services to take advantage of those opportunities 
the company intends to use the knowledge obtained in providing its year consulting services to address other computer consulting needs of its clients 
in november  the company acquired pyramid information services  inc pyramid  a los angeles  california based company that provides computer mainframe outsourcing services  including data processing  operations and systems support  network and production control  and management services

as the company expands its service offerings to include more applications and infrastructure outsourcing  quality assurance and testing  and applications integration gross margin may be impacted due to the different gross margin of each activity

it is not expected that the adoption of these accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on the company s operating results or financial condition 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to identify the applicable year 
any of the company s computer equipment  software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may mistakenly identify a date field using as the year  rather than the year state of readiness the company provides year consulting services to fortune companies and government agencies and is employing the same methods and processes to complete its own internal year project that it provides to its customers 
the company has established a year task force  comprised of members representing the different business operations of the company  to assess and remediate the impact of the year on its it and non it systems  material third party relationships  and service and product offerings 
as identified by the task force  the year issues facing data dimensions that may have a material impact on its ability to continue its business practices as usual through the change of the century include internal business systems  internet and intranet service  telecommunications  power  and the compliance and readiness of the company s third party suppliers  vendors  and customers 
the task force has divided the company s year project into three major phases assessment and planning  implementation  and verification and contingency planning 
the company is completing the assessment and planning phase of the project 
to date  this has not revealed any information which indicates that the magnitude of the company s year problem is material 
during the implementation phase of the project  the company will replace obsolete systems and update or repair the hardware  applications and data so they are year compliant 
during the verification and contingency planning phase of the project  the company will perform acceptance testing and review the results to determine that the updated applications are ready to return to production as well as remove any unused and outdated hardware and software  and migrate the various systems to production status 
based on information compiled to date  the company expects to substantially complete its compliance project  as outlined above  by mid in addition to its own compliance efforts  the company is conducting an assessment of the third parties with which it has material relationships to determine if they are year compliant 
the company has contacted its key vendors and suppliers by the distribution of questionnaires 
to date  the company has not received sufficient responses to make a definitive statement  however  the responses received indicate that these key vendors and suppliers are addressing their year issues 
prior to the start of the company s year project  implementation of a new enterprise wide integrated accounting package to provide for the financial needs of the organization was completed 
this software has been warranted by the vendor to be year compliant 
similarly  the operating system used by data dimensions information services  inc  the company s subsidiary which outsources mainframe computer processing services  also has been warranted by the vendor to be year compliant 
finally  the company has replaced its phone and voicemail systems with new  year compliant systems to better provide for the expanding communication needs of the organization 
costs to address year issues the total estimated cost of the project is approximately million 
these costs consist primarily of the cost of labor needed to complete the company s readiness and compliance project 
the approximate labor cost during was  with the remainder to be incurred in the decision by the company to acquire new accounting and phone software and equipment  and the timing thereof  arose in the ordinary course of the growth of the company  and is not considered a cost associated with the year issue 
risks of year issues the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
if such failures occur  the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected and the company may be required to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems not addressed by the company s compliance efforts 
additionally  if any of the company s material suppliers or vendors are not fully year compliant  it is possible that a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions in the company s operations or potential problems with its product and service offerings could result 
contingency plans part of the company s year project includes the preparation of contingency plans 
the company anticipates completion of its contingency plans by mid outlook issues and uncertainties the company does not provide forecasts of future financial performance 
while the company s management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results the company has experienced and may experience in the future fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
several factors may influence revenues  including the number and requirements of client engagements  employee productivity rates  the company s ability to retain key personnel  the ability of the company to develop  introduce and successfully market new and enhanced products and services  and general economic conditions which may affect clients decisions about the extent and timing of investments in their information systems 
unanticipated termination of a significant project or client decision not to proceed to further project stages could result in decreased revenues  lower employee productivity rates and lower profits 
additionally  varying factors affecting gross margins include the number and project phase of services provided during a particular period  employee productivity  staffing mix  and salary and other compensation related costs necessary to attract and retain qualified personnel 
retention and recruitment of technical personnel the company s business is labor intensive and depends to a significant extent on its ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled professionals 
qualified technical professionals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  the information services industry has experienced high employee turnover rates  which have increased in recent periods 
the manner and extent to which companies respond to recruiting and retention pressures will likely result in increases in the amounts and types of compensation being offered to employees 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel or in retaining existing and future employees 
dependence on knowledge consulting business the company s knowledge consulting business has accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent of revenues in  and  respectively 
as a result  the company s future operating results depend to a significant extent on the continued growth and profitability of that business 
the knowledge consulting business has derived a significant portion of its revenue from a limited number of large clients 
the volume of work performed for specific clients varies from period to period  and a major client in one year may not be a major client in a subsequent period 
there can be no assurance that in the future one or more of the company s larger clients will not terminate a contract  reduce the scope of a large project or elect not to proceed to a stage of a project as anticipated by the company 
the cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of large projects could have a material effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on major clients the company has depended  and likely will continue to depend  on a limited number of large clients to generate a significant portion of its revenue 
in the ten largest clients accounted for approximately percent of the company s revenue and the company expects one client to generate more than percent of revenue in the dependence on a few clients exposes the company to potentially significant financial consequences if one or more of these clients elect to terminate their contract  reduce the scope of a large project  or elect not to proceed to a project stage in accordance with the company s expectations 
any such action by one or more of these clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial performance 
risks associated with year business and new products and services the company expects to derive a significant portion of its revenue from year services through at least there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in increasing its year business or that the revenue growth rate in future years will approach the levels attained in prior years or  to the extent that such business increases  that the company will be able to meet the demand for such services on a timely basis 
furthermore  while a substantial majority of the company s current business is for year projects  the company expects this demand to begin to decrease as the implementation and testing of conversion projects are completed 
the company is incorporating strategies to leverage its knowledge of client systems into additional engagements involving other than year solutions 
the company s ability to successfully develop new services and products depends on a number of factors  including its ability to identify and effectively integrate such services and products into the company s existing organizational structure 
by devoting significant resources to its year business  the company s ability to develop and market new services and products could be adversely affected 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in generating additional business from its year clients for other services or that the financial performance of any new offerings will meet expectations 
competition the markets for the company s services and products are highly competitive and characterized by rapid change and uncertainty due to new and emerging technologies 
the market for consulting services is fragmented  regionalized and no company holds a dominant position 
as a result  in addition to competing with larger national and international service providers  the company also competes with large regional providers 
also  in many instances the company finds itself competing with the internal information systems resources of its clients and prospective clients 
competition is expected to continue and intensify as the market for information technology services and products develop 
there can be no assurance that other companies will not develop services and products that will be more successful than those of the company 
company management believes that distinguishing competitive factors in the industry include  among others  strong client relationships  quality of services and products  price  project management capability  and technical and business expertise 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully with its current and future competitors 
volatility of stock price the company s common stock has been subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations in the past 
additionally  the stock market has experienced significant price fluctuations  particularly among technology companies  which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of specific companies 
any announcement with respect to any unfavorable variance in revenues or net income from levels generally expected by securities analysts or investors would have an immediate and significant effect on the trading price of the common stock 
in addition  factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new services or products by the company  its competitors or other third parties  rumors of such innovations or new services or products  changing market conditions in the industry  changes in estimates by securities analysts  announcements of unusual events  or general economic conditions may have a significant impact on the market price of the stock
