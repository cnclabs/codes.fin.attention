form k for the year ended december  international sales and operations 
sales of products and the provision of services to end users outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenues in the company anticipates that international sales and services will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company may be subject to certain risks  including risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import or export including export of high technology products or otherwise resulting from trade or foreign policy and risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations 
additional risks include potentially adverse tax consequences  tariffs  quotas and other barriers  potential difficulties involving the company s strategic alliances and managing foreign sales agents or representatives and potential difficulties in accounts receivable collection 
the company currently sells products and provides services to customers in emerging market economies such as russia  ukraine  bulgaria  and the czech republic  as well as to customers in countries whose economies have suffered in the recent asian financial crisis 
the company has taken steps designed to reduce the additional risks associated with doing business in these countries  but the company believes that such risks may still exist and include  among others  general political and economic instability  lack of currency convertibility  as well as uncertainty with respect to the efficacy of applicable legal systems 
there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  the company s ability to expand its business into certain emerging international markets is dependent  in part  on the ability of its customers to obtain financing 
revenues in the nuclear power industry 
although  the company has reduced its reliance on the development of large application systems having multi year delivery schedules  such as full scope nuclear power plant simulation projects  the company will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from customers in the nuclear power industry  particularly the international nuclear power industry  for the foreseeable future 
the company s ability to supply nuclear power plant simulators and related products and services is dependent on the continued operation of nuclear power plants and  to a lesser extent  on the construction of new nuclear power plants 
a wide range of factors affects the continued operation and construction of nuclear power plants  including the political and regulatory environment  the availability and cost of alternative means of power generation  the occurrence of future nuclear incidents  general economic conditions and the ability of customers to obtain adequate financing 
revenues in the chemicals industry 
the company derives a portion of its revenues from companies in the chemicals industry 
accordingly  the company s future performance is dependent to a certain extent upon the demand for the company s products by customers in the chemical industry 
the company s revenues may be subject to period to period fluctuations as a consequence of industry cycles  as well as general domestic and foreign economic conditions and other factors affecting spending by companies in the company s target process industries 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
product development and technological change 
the company believes that its success will depend in large part on its ability to maintain and enhance its current product line  develop new products  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer needs 
the company s product development activities are aimed at the development and expansion of its library of software modeling tools  the improvement of its display systems and workstation technologies  and the advancement and upgrading of its simulation and process control technologies 
the life cycles for software modeling tools  display system software  process control and simulation technologies are variable and largely determined by competitive pressures 
consequently  the company will need to continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance and expand its capabilities in these areas and to maintain its competitive advantage 
the company s products are offered in markets affected by technological change and emerging standards which are influenced by customer preferences 
the company has expended significant resources in developing versions of its core products which operate in the increasingly popular windows nt r environment  however  there can be no assurance of customer acceptance of these windows nt r based products or that these products will be competitive with products offered by the company s competitors 
although the company believes that no significant trends to migrate to other operating platforms currently affect the markets for the company s products  there can be no assurance that customers will not require compatibility with such other operating platforms in the future

form k for the year ended december  intellectual property rights 
although the company believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements and reliable product maintenance are important to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position  the company s business depends  in part  on its intellectual property rights in its proprietary technology and information 
the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  copyright  patent and trademark law  contractual arrangements and technical means to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants  joint venture and alliance partners  customers and other third parties that are granted access to its proprietary information  and generally limits access to and distribution of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company has protected or will be able to protect its proprietary technology and information adequately  that the unauthorized disclosure or use of the company s proprietary information will be prevented  that others have not or will not develop similar technology or information independently  or  to the extent the company owns patents  that others have not or will not be able to design around those patents 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which the company s products are sold do not protect the company s products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
competition 
the company s businesses operate in highly competitive environments with both domestic and foreign competitors  many of whom have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
the principal factors affecting competition include price  technological proficiency  ease of system configuration  product reliability  applications expertise  engineering support  local presence and financial stability 
the company believes that competition in the simulation and process automation fields may further intensify in the future as a result of advances in technology  consolidations and or strategic alliances among competitors  increased costs required to develop new technology and the increasing importance of software content in systems and products 
the company believes that its technology leadership  experience  ability to provide a wide variety of solutions  product support and related services  open architecture and international alliances will allow it to compete effectively in these markets 
as the company s business has a significant international component  changes in the value of the dollar could adversely affect the company s ability to compete internationally

form k for the year ended december  year legal climate  generally 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects of failure of computer programs and embedded systems to adequately function through and after the year millenium change 
the company is currently implementing a testing and compliance program to ascertain whether and to what extent the company may need to update certain of its software products to become year ready 
the company does not intend to test or modify all prior versions of its software products  test the behavior of current products when used on non year ready computer systems  test custom applications developed by or for customers  or test certain current software products that the company plans to replace with either new software products or year ready releases by the end of certain of the company s software products are currently year ready  however  the company has not yet completed testing on many of the other software products that it intends to test 
there can be no assurance that the company will complete in a timely manner the testing of such software products or the development of any updates necessary to render such software products year ready 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter year problems arising from recently acquired technologies or any other technologies that the company may acquire in the future 
moreover  the ability of the company s software products to comply with year requirements depends in part upon the availability of year ready versions of operating systems and software applications used by or with the company s products 
there can be no assurance that year problems will not cause the company to incur material expenses in responding to such problems  result in third party claims against the company or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has reviewed certain internal information systems to assess year compliance 
the company expects that its internal system development plans will address the year issue and will correct mission critical systems 
the company believes that the cost of any modifications will not be material 
however  the company s ability to implement its information systems plan and to make the necessary modifications or replacements may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside the control of the company  including the availability and cost of trained personnel and the ability of such personnel to acquire year ready systems and otherwise to locate and correct all relevant computer codes 
the company is also conducting an assessment of certain other systems that may affect its operations in order to more fully identify and plan for any year risks 
if there are unidentified dependencies on such systems to operate the business  or if any required modifications are not completed on a timely basis or are more costly to implement than currently anticipated  the company s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
reliance on key technical and executive personnel 
the company s operations are dependent on the efforts of its technical personnel and its senior management 
thus  recruiting and retaining capable personnel  particularly engineers  computer scientists and other personnel with expertise in computer software and hardware  are critical to the future performance of the company 
competition for qualified technical and management personnel is substantial  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to continue to operate profitably 
legal liability 
the company s business could expose it to third party claims with respect to product  environmental and other similar liabilities 
although the company has sought to protect itself from these potential liabilities through a variety of legal and contractual provisions as well as through liability insurance  the effectiveness of such protections has not been fully tested 
the failure or malfunction of one of the company s systems or devices could create potential liability for substantial monetary damages and environmental cleanup costs 
such damages or claims could exceed the applicable coverage of the company s insurance 
although management has no knowledge of material liability claims against the company to date  such potential future claims could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
certain of the company s products and services are used by the nuclear power industry  although the company believes that it does not have significant liability exposure associated with such use as nearly all such products and services relate to training  and although the company s contracts for such products and services typically contain provisions designed to protect the company from potential liabilities associated with such use  there can be no assurance that the company would not be materially adversely affected by claims or actions which may potentially arise

the company has never declared or paid a cash dividend on its common stock 
the company currently intends to retain future earnings to finance the growth and development of its business  and therefore does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the company believes factors such as quarterly fluctuations in results of operations and announcements of new products by the company or by its competitors may cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate  perhaps significantly 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the shares of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the company s common stock has also experienced a relatively low trading volume  making it further susceptible to extreme price fluctuations 
these factors may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock

the year problem concerns the inability of information systems to properly recognize and process date sensitive information beyond january  the company has established a compliance program intended to bring its software and systems into year compliance in time to minimize any significant detrimental effects on operations 
this program covers company s own products and installed base  significant vendors and customers  and financial and administrative systems 
the company s program recognizes that date sensitive systems may fail at different points in time depending on their function 
systems having forward looking planning and production functions may fail earlier and require corrective actions sooner to allow for reasonable testing 
other applications may fail only during the transition to year the company plans to utilize internal personnel  contractors and vendors to identify year noncompliance problems  modify code and test the modifications 
in some cases  non compliant software and hardware will be replaced 
current product offerings 
the company believes that it has identified substantially all potential year problems with the current versions of the software products it develops and markets 
however  management also believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting the company s software products have been identified or corrected due to complexity of these products and the fact that these products interact with other third party vendor products and integrate on computer systems which are not under the company s control 
the company s program includes the testing and  if necessary  the modification of new versions of its products to ensure year readiness 
previous versions and installed base 
older versions of the company s software will require modification to work properly through and after the year the company offers year evaluation services to its customers having older systems to determine the scope of work required to correct any problems 
the company s program also includes the development of patches for certain previous versions of the company s products  which may be purchased by customers 
however  there can be no assurance that such patches would correct all year problems in such previous versions  and there can be no assurance that evaluation services and patches will be purchased and implemented by the company s customers 
suppliers 
the company has initiated communications with third party suppliers of the major computer system components  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company to identify and  to the extent possible  to resolve issues involving the year problem 
however  the company has limited or no control over the actions of these third party suppliers 
thus  while the company expects that it will be able to resolve any significant year problems with these systems  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will resolve any or all year problems with these systems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the business of the company or any of its customers

the company also relies on various administrative and financial applications eg  order processing and collection systems that require correction to properly handle year dates 
in the event one of these systems is not adequately corrected  the company s ability to capture  schedule and fulfill customer demands could be impaired 
likewise  if a collection processing system were to fail  the company may not be able to properly apply payments to customer balances or correctly determine cash balances 
the company plans to update its primary accounting system in the spring of and centrally contolled administrative applications are being aessed and tested 
various non centrally controlled systems are also utilized by the company s businesses 
the impact of a failure of these systems would be limited to the business using the affected system  and then only to the extent that manual or other alternate processes were not able to meet processing requirements 
such an occurrence is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the company 
significant customers 
the company is also dependent upon its customers for sales and cash flow 
year interruptions in the company s customers operations could result in reduced sales  increased inventory or receivable levels and cash flow reductions 
while these events are possible  the company anticipates that its customer base is broad enough to minimize the affects of such interruptions 
the company plans  however  to monitor the status of the company s customers as a means of determining risks and alternatives 
costs 
the company estimates that the aggregate costs to address the year issue will not exceed approximately million in the company believes that most of the customer related costs associated with the year issue would have occurred as part of its normal operations 
the company does not track these costs separately  and prior to  the company did not separately budget for costs related to the year issue 
of the amount to be expended in  the company believes that approximately  primarily related to upgrades to internal systems  is incremental to normal operating costs 
while the company believes its efforts will provide reasonable assurance that material disruptions to its internal systems and installed products will not occur  the potential for interruption still exists 
the company s policy is to expense as incurred information system maintenance costs and to capitalize the cost of new software and hardware and amortize or depreciate it over the assets useful lives 
there can be no assurance that the cost estimates associated with the company s year issues will prove to be accurate or that the actual costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
contingency plans 
the company is currently developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of its efforts to identify and correct year problems affecting its internal systems and installed products 
depending on the systems affected  these plans could include accelerated replacement of affected equipment or software  short to medium term use of backup equipment and software  increased work hours for company personnel or use of contract personnel to correct on an accelerated schedule any year problems that arise or to provide manual workarounds for information systems  and similar approaches 
if the company is required to implement any of these contingency plans  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the above discussion of the company s efforts  and management s expectations  relating to year compliance are forward looking statements 
the company s ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  suppliers ability to bring their systems into year compliance  and unanticipated problems identified in the company s ongoing compliance review
