item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
certain comparisons between periods have been made on a percentage or weighted average per square foot basis 
the latter technique adjusts for square footage changes at different times during the year 
general overview at december   the company operated manufacturers outlet centers  compared to at the end of and at the end of the company s operating gross leasable area gla at december  was million square feet compared to million square feet and million square feet at december  and  respectively

in addition  approximately   and of the company s revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from the company s centers in california 
the company does not consider any single store lease to be material  no individual tenant  combining all of its store concepts  accounts for more than of the company s gross revenues or total gla  and only one tenant occupies more than of the company s total gla 
in view of these statistics and the company s past success in re leasing available space  the company believes the loss of any individual tenant would not have a significant effect on future operations

year compliance the year yk issue refers generally to computer applications using only the last two digits to refer to a year rather than all four digits 
as a result  these applications could fail or create erroneous results if they recognize as the year rather than the year the company has taken yk initiatives in three general areas which represent the areas that could have an impact on the company information technology systems  non information technology systems and third party issues 
the following is a summary of these initiatives information technology the company has focused its efforts on the high risk areas of the corporate office computer hardware  operating systems and software applications 
the company s assessment and testing of existing equipment revealed that its hardware  network operating systems and most of the software applications are yk compliant 
the exception is the dos based accounting systems which were upgraded and replaced at the beginning of to make them compatible with windows applications primarily used by the company 
non information technology non information technology consists mainly of facilities management systems such as telephone  utility and security systems for the corporate office and the outlet centers 
the company has reviewed the corporate facility management systems and made inquiry of the building owner manager and concluded that the corporate office building systems including telephone  utilities  fire and security systems are yk compliant 
the company is in the process of identifying date sensitive systems and equipment including hvac units  telephones  security systems and alarms  fire and flood warning systems and general office systems at its outlet centers 
assessment and testing of these systems is approximately complete and expected to be completed by june  critical non compliant systems will be replaced when identified 
based on preliminary assessment  the cost of replacement is not expected to be significant 
third parties the company has third party relationships with approximately tenants and  suppliers and contractors 
many of these third parties are publicly traded corporations and subject to disclosure requirements 
the company has begun assessment of major third parties yk readiness including tenants  key suppliers of outsourced services including stock transfer  debt servicing  banking collection and disbursement  payroll and benefits  while simultaneously responding to their inquiries regarding the company s readiness 
the majority of the company s vendors are small suppliers that the company believes can manually execute their business and are readily replaceable 
management also believes there is no material risk of being unable to procure necessary supplies and services 
third party assessment is approximately complete and expected to be completed by june  the company continues to monitor yk disclosures in sec filings of publicly owned third parties 
costs the accounting software upgrade and conversion is being executed under maintenance and support agreements with software vendors 
the total cost of the accounting conversion which the company had previously commenced during the third quarter is estimated at approximately  including the yk portion of the conversion that cannot be readily identified and is not material to the operating results or financial position of the company 
the identification and remediation of systems at the outlet centers is being accomplished by in house business systems personnel and outlet center general managers whose costs are recorded as normal operating expense 
the assessment of third party readiness is also being conducted by in house personnel whose costs are recorded as normal operating expenses 
the company is not yet in a position to estimate the cost of third party compliance issues  but has no reason to believe  based upon its evaluations to date  that such costs will exceed risks the principal risks to the company relating to the completion of its accounting software conversion is failure to correctly bill tenants by december  and to pay invoices when due 
management believes it has adequate resources  or could obtain the needed resources  to manually bill tenants and pay bills until the systems became operational 
the principal risks to the company relating to non information systems at the outlet centers are failure to identify time sensitive systems and inability to find a suitable replacement system 
the company believes that adequate replacement components or new systems are available at reasonable prices and are in good supply 
the company also believes that adequate time and resources are available to remediate these areas as needed 
the principal risks to the company in its relationships with third parties are the failure of third party systems used to conduct business such as tenants being unable to stock stores with merchandise  use cash registers and pay invoices  banks being unable to process receipts and disbursements  vendors being unable to supply needed materials and services to the centers  and processing of outsourced employee payroll 
based on yk compliance work done to date  the company has no reason to believe that key tenants  banks and suppliers will not be yk compliant in all material respects or can not be replaced within an acceptable timeframe 
the company will attempt to obtain compliance certification from suppliers of key services as soon as such certifications are available 
contingency plans the company intends to deal with contingency planning during as results of the above assessments are known 
the company s description of its yk compliance issue is based upon information obtained by management through evaluations of internal business systems and from tenant and vendor compliance efforts 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to address the yk issues for all its systems in a timely manner or that it will not encounter unexpected difficulties or significant expenses relating to adequately addressing the yk issue 
if the company or the major tenants or vendors with whom the company does business fail to address their major yk issues  the company s operating results or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo should be considered in conjunction with net income  as presented in the statements of operations included elsewhere herein  to facilitate a clearer understanding of the operating results of the company 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance for an equity real estate investment trust 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is net income applicable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales or writedowns of property  exclusive of outparcel sales  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash from operations  and is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs 
year ended december  income to common shareholders before extraordinary item   add depreciation and amortization   amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets   loss on writedown of assets  minority interest   ffo   average shares units outstanding   dividends declared per share note excludes depreciation and minority interest attributed to a third party limited partner s interest in a partnership for the year ended december  economic conditions substantially all leases contain provisions  including escalations of base rents and percentage rentals calculated on gross sales  to mitigate the impact of inflation 
inflationary increases in common area maintenance and real estate tax expenses are substantially all reimbursed by tenants 
virtually all tenants have met their lease obligations and the company continues to attract and retain quality tenants 
the company intends to reduce operating and leasing risks by continually improving its tenant mix  rental rates and lease terms  and by pursuing contracts with creditworthy upscale and national brand name tenants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its floating rate debt arrangements 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire rate curve would adversely affect the company s annual interest cost by approximately million annually
