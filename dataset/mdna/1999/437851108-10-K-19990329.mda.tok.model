item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and all of the financial statements and related notes thereto appearing in item to this form k 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in item selected financial data and the financial statements of homestead may not be indicative of future operations of homestead 
for analysis purposes homestead categorizes its operating properties as comparable  noncomparable  or new opening 
comparable means a property open throughout both periods of comparison  noncomparable means a property open for only a portion of the prior period of comparison  and new opening means a property opened in the most recent period 
for additional analysis purposes homestead also categorizes its operating properties as either stabilized or pre stabilized 
for purposes of this report  the term stabilized means those properties which obtained occupancy for a one week period or have been opened for weeks and pre stabilized means all other operating properties 
the statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which homestead operates  management s beliefs and assumptions made by management 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
among the important factors that could cause homestead s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements are i changes in general economic conditions in its target markets that could adversely affect demand for homestead s properties  ii the effects of increased or unexpected competition with respect to one or more properties  iii homestead s ability to open new properties on schedule which may be affected by factors outside the control of homestead  iv availability to homestead of debt or equity financing or other arrangements to allow development of land owned and acquisition and development of sites under pursuit  v the matters described under risks factors and vi changes in financial markets and interest rates that could adversely affect homestead s cost of capital and its ability to meet its financing needs and obligations 
risk factors homestead will require substantial additional capital homestead will continue to require a substantial amount of additional capital to finance its short term obligations and future growth 
costs to fund commitments on properties under construction at december  is approximately million 
additional expected funding required for properties in planning and owned is approximately million  and the expected funding required to acquire and develop properties under pursuit is approximately million 
as a result  homestead anticipates seeking to raise substantial additional amounts of capital throughout homestead may seek additional credit facilities and may seek to issue long term debt and additional equity securities or enter into joint venture or other arrangements 
homestead is currently restricted by the terms and covenants of its bank lines of credit in the type and amount of additional indebtedness it may incur 
no assurance can be given regarding the availability or terms of such financing 
any future debt financings or issuances of preferred shares by homestead will be senior to the rights of the holders of common shares  and any future issuances of common or preferred shares may result in the dilution of the then existing shareholders proportionate equity interest in homestead 
if homestead cannot secure adequate funding or complete other development arrangements then it may have to discontinue the development process on some or all of the land sites owned resulting in expensing of carrying costs  such as interest and property taxes  and expensing of costs of its internal development group  which could materially adversely affect reported earnings 
similarly  if pursuits of some or all of the land sites are abandoned homestead may incur write offs of pursuit costs and loss of non refundable earnest money deposits 
if discontinuance of development of land sites is required or pursuits of land sites for acquisition are abandoned due to financing constraints  then homestead intends to mitigate incurrence of expenses and cash outflows by seeking to sell land sites  sell and assign rights to acquire sites under pursuit  terminate personnel  or take other appropriate actions all of which may result in additional losses for financial statement purposes 
in the event that homestead is required to liquidate some of its real estate holdings expeditiously  its ability to achieve a desirable sales price could be adversely affected 
homestead is subject to a substantial amount of indebtedness at december   homestead s total indebtedness was approximately million 
homestead will be required to seek refinancing for all or a portion of that debt or to obtain additional financing  if it is at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its debt or satisfy other covenants under its loan agreements  which include limitations on the amount of additional indebtedness that homestead can incur 
there can be no assurance that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to homestead 
the amount of homestead s indebtedness may also make homestead more vulnerable to economic downturns and may limit its ability to withstand adverse changes or to capitalize on business opportunities 
additionally  substantially all of homestead s properties have been pledged as collateral to secure the payment of homestead s indebtedness 
if homestead were to default in the payment of any of the secured indebtedness  homestead could lose the properties securing such debt 
the loss of such properties could have a material adverse effect on homestead s financial condition and results of operations 
significant influence of principal shareholder may impact homestead management and operations as of december   security capital owned approximately of the issued and outstanding common shares of homestead and  therefore controls approximately of the vote on matters submitted for shareholder action  including the election of directors 
pursuant to an investor agreement with homestead  security capital currently has the right to nominate up to two directors of homestead 
additionally  so long as archstone owns million principal amount of convertible mortgage notes  it is entitled to nominate one person as a director of homestead 
the directors so elected are in a position to exercise significant influence over the affairs of homestead if they were to act together in the future 
john c 
schweitzer  a director of homestead  is deemed to be a nominee of archstone and security capital under the investor agreement 
further  john p 
frazee  a director of homestead  is a member of the security capital board of directors 
for so long as security capital beneficially owns at least of homestead s outstanding common shares  security capital has the right to approve  among other significant matters homestead s annual operating budget and substantial deviations therefrom  acquisitions or dispositions in a single transaction or group of related transactions where the purchase price exceeds million  property management arrangements  the declaration or payment of any dividend or other distribution  the offer or sale of any shares of stock of homestead or any securities convertible into shares of stock of homestead  the incurrence  restructuring  renegotiation or repayment of indebtedness which exceeds million  and the increase of the number of directors to more than seven 
accordingly  due to the foregoing  for so long as it continues to beneficially own at least of homestead s outstanding common shares  security capital will retain significant influence over the affairs of homestead which may result in decisions that do not fully represent the interests of all shareholders of homestead 
homestead has entered into a subscription agreement with security capital whereby security capital has agreed to purchase million of subordinated debentures from homestead 
this subscription was pledged as security for a million bank line of credit facility referred to as the bridge facility 
if the subscription is called by homestead or homestead receives proceeds from any offering of securities  the proceeds must be used to first repay the bridge facility and second to fund projects under development which secure the working capital facilities 
the debentures would bear interest at a rate of over the rate homestead incurs under its million credit facility which became a million facility on march  
homestead may repurchase the debentures with the proceeds of an equity offering within days of issuance of the debentures 
on the th day following the issuance of the debentures the debentures convert to common shares  on a per share basis  at the lowest of i  ii the fair market value  based upon a trading day average  on the date any debentures are issued  and iii the fair market value  based upon a day trading average  on the date the debentures are converted automatically in shares 
the subscription agreement expires the earlier of june  or two weeks after termination of the million credit agreement 
the subscription obligation is reduced or terminated to the extent homestead issues equity securities to any third party  or to security capital pursuant to a separate offering  including in connection with the rights offering announced march   and the proceeds are used to repay this credit facility 
if the subscription is called by homestead and if the debentures are converted to common stock security capital would own approximate of the outstanding common shares of homestead 
no assurance can be given that security capital will provide further financial accommodation for homestead 
in conjunction with security capital s entering into the subscription agreement  homestead paid an arrangement fee to security capital of  seasonal fluctuations in the lodging industry may affect homestead s operating results the lodging industry is seasonal in nature  with the second and third quarters generally accounting for a greater proportion of annual revenues than the first and fourth quarters 
quarterly earnings may be adversely affected by events beyond homestead s control such as poor weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
competition and overdevelopment could adversely affect homestead s operations each homestead village property is  or will be  located in a developed area that includes competing properties 
the number of competitors in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy  average weekly rates and weekly revenue per available room 
competition within the extended stay lodging market has increased substantially 
in several markets where homestead has properties  there is intense competition for the extended stay customer which has already affected occupancy and weekly revenue per available room for these properties 
in addition  since the lodging industry has historically been characterized by cyclical trends  there can be no assurance that the current state of supply demand fundamentals will continue into the future 
competition within the lodging industry is based generally on convenience of location  price  range of services and guest amenities offered and quality of customer service 
homestead considers the reasonableness of room rates  the location of properties and the services and the guest amenities provided to be among the most important competitive factors in the business 
a number of other lodging chains and developers have developed or are developing extended stay properties 
in particular  some of these entities have targeted the moderately priced segment of the extended stay market in which homestead competes 
homestead competes for guests and for new development sites with certain of these established entities which may have greater financial resources than homestead and better relationships with lenders and real estate sellers 
these entities may be able to accept more risk than homestead can prudently manage 
further  there can be no assurance that new or existing competitors will not significantly reduce their rates or offer greater convenience  services or amenities or significantly expand or improve properties in markets in which homestead competes  thereby materially adversely affecting homestead s business and results of operations 
homestead s historical growth rate may strain its resources homestead has experienced rapid growth in its revenues  number of properties and employees  and the scope of its operations 
this growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel  as well as added demands on homestead s operating and financial systems 
homestead s growth depends on the efforts of key management personnel and homestead s ability to attract or develop new management personnel and to integrate these new employees into its overall operations 
if homestead is unable to manage growth effectively  homestead s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the value of homestead s real estate is dependent on numerous factors real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
real estate values are affected by a number of factors  including changes in the general economic climate  local conditions  such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area  the quality and philosophy of management  competition from other available space  the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance and insurance  the ability of the owner to control variable operating costs  government regulations  interest rate levels  the availability of financing  and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning  tax and other laws 
homestead s development activities may be unsuccessful subject to the availability of financing  homestead intends to continue to pursue development activities as opportunities arise and  as a result  will be subject to risks associated with any such development activities 
these risks include the risk that development opportunities explored by homestead may be abandoned  the risk that construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated  limited cash flow during the construction period  the risk that occupancy percentages and rates at a completed project will not be sufficient to make the project profitable  and the risk that government and other approvals may not be obtained 
in case of an unsuccessful development project  homestead s loss could exceed its investment in the project 
illiquidity of real estate investments equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore may tend to limit the ability of homestead to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  significant expenditures associated with equity real estate investments  such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments 
further  various agreements to which homestead is a party  including the terms of homestead s outstanding indebtedness  place limitations on the ability of homestead to sell its properties 
thus  homestead s ability to sell assets at any time to change its asset base may be restricted 
further  if additional financing is not obtained to continue development of land sites owned homestead may seek to sell certain properties in planning and owned 
no assurance can be given that any sales will occur or  if such sales occur  that the proceeds of such sale will be sufficient to cover homestead s costs 
homestead may seek joint venture partners for certain properties in planning and owned 
no assurance can be given that any joint venture will be consummated or that the terms thereof will be favorable to homestead 
uninsured losses may adversely affect homestead some types of losses  such as from hurricanes may be uninsurable  or the cost of insuring against such losses may not be economically justifiable 
if an uninsured loss occurs  homestead could lose both the invested capital in and anticipated revenues from the facility  but would still be obligated to repay any recourse mortgage indebtedness on the facility 
homestead could be subject to potential environmental liability under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner  developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at  on  under or in its property 
the costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of such hazardous substances 
the presence of such substances on homestead s properties may adversely affect its ability to sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may also have an adverse affect on homestead s ability to pay distributions to its shareholders 
costs of compliance with laws may affect homestead s financial condition homestead s facilities are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as state and local fire and life safety requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
there can be no assurance that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed  a result that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by homestead and could have an adverse effect on homestead s financial condition and results of operations 
overview general since the first homestead village property was opened in and through december  homestead has completed development of homestead village properties consisting of  rooms in cities 
as of december   homestead had properties under construction totaling  rooms within eight of these cities as well as one additional city 
in addition  as of december   homestead owned development sites and controlled through contracts development sites 
homestead s development program resulted in opening properties in  in and in this development program and the financing activities required to support it have had a significant impact on homestead s operations for the years ended  and and on homestead s financial position as of december  and the tightening of capital markets for real estate operating companies and lodging companies in has had an adverse effect on homestead s ability to continue its development program 
additionally  due to the limited availability of other financing  homestead primarily utilized short term bank line of credit borrowings in to finance development costs 
the year end outstanding bank line borrowings combined with other short term debt gives homestead total short term obligations of million at december  subsequent to year end  homestead has repaid million of such debt with proceeds of a sale leaseback and obtained an extension of the bank lines under which million was outstanding at year end while the actions taken subsequent to year end are expected to strengthen homestead s balance sheet  homestead will need substantial additional financing to repay indebtedness as it matures  develop land sites owned and acquire and develop sites under pursuit 
homestead s property investments from the date of the mergers see background mergers below through december  have been funded primarily by million from borrowings from archstone  million in exercises of warrants  million net borrowings under its bank lines of credit  and million from a january common stock rights offering 
homestead s operating results are substantially influenced by i the demand for and supply of extended stay lodging in homestead s markets and submarkets  ii occupancy and average weekly rate  iii the effectiveness of property level operations and iv the pace and cost at which homestead can develop additional extended stay lodging properties 
capital and credit market conditions which affect homestead s access to and cost of capital may influence future operating results 
background mergers prior to october  the operating assets of homestead were held primarily by the ptr subsidiaries and one operating property  opened in mid  was held by a subsidiary of atlantic 
onsite property management was performed by a subsidiary of security capital and other entity management services were performed under management agreements with subsidiaries of security capital 
neither ptr nor atlantic had any employees 
all persons performing services related to homestead village properties prior to the mergers were employees of the management subsidiaries of security capital 
upon the closing of the mergers  all of the ptr and atlantic homestead village properties became assets of homestead 
additionally  with the acquisition of certain security capital subsidiaries  all onsite property management and overall corporate management became an internal function of homestead whereby homestead directly incurs the costs of all property level  land acquisition  due diligence  development and corporate personnel 
in comparing and operating results to  in addition to the change in to internal management  the operating results of homestead reported in the accompanying financial statements are affected by certain matters of financial presentation for the mergers 
the merger with the ptr subsidiaries was accounted for as a combination of entities under common control in a manner similar to a pooling of interests  thus the historical financial results of the ptr subsidiaries are presented for all periods prior to october  and  as the activities of homestead prior to the mergers were not significant  the accompanying financial statements consist predominantly of the activities of the ptr subsidiaries prior to the merger closing date 
the merger of the subsidiaries of atlantic was accounted for as a purchase  thus the operating revenues and operating expenses of its one property opened in mid are not included in the accompanying financial statements until the date of the mergers 
additionally  the development activities of the subsidiaries of atlantic are not reflected in the accompanying financial statements until the merger closing date and thereafter 
the merger of the subsidiaries of security capital was also accounted for as a purchase  thus the incurrence of the costs of personnel for property and corporate management are effective in the accompanying financial statements after the merger closing date 
development activity homestead s property development program has had a significant impact on its financial performance during  and the following table summarizes homestead s development activity for  and dollar amounts in thousands properties under construction starts during period properties rooms    completions during period properties rooms    under construction at year end properties rooms    total expected investment    completed properties properties rooms    total investment  at historical cost    the table summarizes the investment activity for all homestead village properties regardless of the form of ownership of such properties prior to the mergers 
rooms data for reflects the most recent adjustments to configurations as of december  recent operating results homestead expects that its results for the first quarter of will be below management s plan 
lower than expected occupancy rates in several of its markets has led to lower than expected revenues for properties in those markets 
lower than expected increases in occupancy rates for newly opened properties in the northeast and midwest  caused in part by adverse weather conditions  also are expected to impact revenues 
these lower than expected results could affect homestead s results of operations for the first quarter of results of operations for the years ended december   and net earnings loss for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the net loss in includes i a third quarter loss on extinguishment of debt of million recorded as an extraordinary item and ii incurrence of special charges of million  primarily relating to homestead s reorganization of its internal development department and abandonment of certain pursuits  recorded in fourth quarter see investing and financing activities under liquidity and capital resources below 
a discussion of other major components of net earnings or loss follows 
property operations the following table sets forth operating performance information for the years ended december   and the information is for homestead s total operating property portfolio 
performance of the one operating property acquired from atlantic has been included from its opening date of july  versus its date of acquisition in the mergers 
inclusion of such property has an insignificant effect on the performance data presented 
change change over over weekly revpar average weekly rate occupancy property operating income margin homestead s new property openings were the primary reason for room revenue increases of million in over and million in over properties open for their first full year in and were the next most significant reason for room revenue increases 
the increase in room revenue was also due to increases in the average weekly rate of in and in the average weekly rate increase in was partially offset by lower overall occupancy in versus the occupancy decrease in versus is attributable to the effect of competition in markets described below for same store properties for total property operating expenses increased million in over and million in over  primarily due to the increase in the number of operating properties as noted above 
homestead properties fully operating throughout consecutive periods homestead had properties which were operating throughout both and same store properties 
revpar for decreased to from in the revpar decrease was due primarily to an occupancy decrease from to 
average weekly rate increases of offset most of the occupancy effect to result in the approximate revpar decrease 
the decrease in occupancy is attributed to competition in markets primarily in the southwest and an increase in homestead s average weekly rates 
homestead had properties that were fully operational throughout both and all but one of such properties are located in texas 
revpar increased in to due to an average weekly rate growth of  offset somewhat by a decrease in occupancy to 
the decline in occupancy was considered the direct result of implementing strategic pricing 
stabilized properties operations revpar for the stabilized properties in increased to from for the stabilized properties in an increase of 
these improvements are primarily attributable to a increase in average weekly rate offset in part by a decrease in occupancy to from 
the decrease in occupancy is attributable to competition in markets primarily located in the southwest and an increase in homestead s average weekly rates 
revpar for the stabilized properties in increased to from for the stabilized properties in  an increase of 
these improvements are primarily attributable to a increase in average weekly rate occupancy was essentially unchanged  and operating efficiencies for homestead s total portfolio 
corporate operating expenses corporate operating expense increased million in over and million in over the increase in over is attributed to the continued growth of the company since the first half of when homestead was still in the process of developing a corporate infrastructure in support of a rapidly growing entity and includes costs for additional personnel in operations  marketing and finance 
the comparisons for over are affected by the fact that corporate expenses reflect a post merger operating basis while operations consist only of the corporate costs and management fee allocations from ptr to the ptr subsidiaries through the date of the mergers 
the increase in relates to the change in corporate structure from external management to internal management and additional corporate costs associated with the continued growth of the company 
this change in structure involves costs associated with operating as a public company  recruiting  relocation and personnel expenses and other costs to create a corporate infrastructure  offset in part by capitalizing costs related to information technology  and the acquisition  development or improvement of real estate 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million in over and million in over depreciation of the cost of properties and improvements is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciation expense exclusive of amortization increased approximately million in over and million in over due to the increased number of properties operating for each year 
amortization expense increased  in over and million in over amortization of the trademarks and other intangibles is calculated on a straight line basis over a period of years 
the increase in amortization is due to amortization of increases in the total recorded cost of the homestead village trademark and other intangible assets 
interest income interest income of   and  for  and  respectively  resulted from investment of excess cash on hand 
nearly all of the amount was earned after the mergers 
interest cost homestead s gross interest cost includes amortization of non cash financing costs arising from the issuance of the warrants to obtain the commitment for convertible mortgage notes financing and the differential between the conversion price of the mortgage notes and the merger date value of shares 
exclusive of such amortized amounts homestead s interest cost comprised of interest on the mortgages  amortization of premiums and discounts on the mortgages  interest on its lines of credit borrowings  amortization of deferred financing costs paid to obtain the lines of credit and interest on the other debt to an affiliate increased million in over and million in over the increases are due to the increase in investments in operating and under construction properties and the corresponding increases in the notes payable and the lines of credit increases used to finance the increases in investments 
homestead s total interest cost  including the amortization of non cash mortgage financing costs described above  decreased million in over and increased million in over the decrease was due to the greater amortization of the non cash financing costs associated with the mortgages in versus the increase was predominantly due to amortization of the non cash financing costs associated with the mortgages 
total interest incurred was offset by capitalization of interest resulting in a net interest expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the net interest expense increase of million in over is the result of increases in total debt and related interest expense  relative to the amount of construction in progress during the year  which results in a proportionate decrease in the amounts of interest capitalized 
homestead s increased development activity in was the reason for capitalization of nearly all interest cost incurred  resulting in a decrease in net interest expense in of million over homestead expects that a decrease in its development activity will result in a decrease in the amount of capitalizable interest costs which will have a negative impact on homestead s earnings 
liquidity and capital resources investing and financing activities during the years ended december    and  homestead invested million  million  and million  respectively  in homestead village properties and completed development of  and properties in each of these years  respectively 
financing of the investments in was accomplished primarily by a january rights offering of common stock  proceeds from bank lines of credit  cash flow from operations and the final funding of the convertible mortgage notes commitments 
the investments were financed in and primarily by exercise of warrants to purchase common stock issued in the mergers  proceeds of the convertible mortgage note funding commitments  proceeds from the lines of credit beginning in  and intercompany debt prior to the mergers in the tightening of capital markets for real estate operating companies and lodging companies in has had an adverse effect on homestead s ability to continue its high growth program of acquisition of land sites and construction of homestead village properties 
in october  homestead reorganized its development effort and recorded million of special charges primarily related to the severance of development personnel and abandonment of certain pursuits of development sites due the limited availability of additional funds for development 
unless homestead receives additional financing  homestead anticipates a slower growth rate in and therefore will have substantially fewer development starts and openings than in prior years 
while homestead completed a common stock rights offering in january  it primarily utilized short term debt and cash flow from operations during the remainder of the year to finance its land acquisition and development program as  due to falling stock market prices for homestead and its sector  common equity was not seen as a viable capital raising alternative 
homestead s maximization of borrowings under its working capital facilities resulted in million outstanding due april  subsequently extended to december  and million outstanding on its bridge facility due february  subsequently extended to april  at year end in addition  in third quarter homestead extinguished million of convertible mortgage debt due october this mortgage debt was convertible into approximately million shares 
as part of this extinguishment  homestead incurred an additional million of indebtedness with a resulting mortgage note payable totaling million with a due date of june therefore  homestead s balance sheet at december  was comprised of substantial short term obligations 
at year end  homestead owed million of short term debt  consisting of million due on its bank lines of credit million due on the working capital facilities and million due on the bridge facility and million due on a mortgage note 
homestead also had properties in construction at december  with unfunded development commitments of approximately million 
homestead intends to finance the completion of the properties under construction with cash on hand  million borrowed under the working capital facilities in january  million additional capacity available under its working capital facilities upon renewal  any additional capacity available after payments made from the proceeds of the rights offering in excess of million and cash flow from operations 
subsequent to year end  homestead refinanced its short term debt as follows 
on february   homestead completed a sale and lease back of of the properties collaterizing the million mortgage note 
hospitality properties trust nyse hpt purchased the properties for million 
proceeds of the sale were used to repay the million debt which was due june homestead will continue to operate the properties under a long term lease through with options to renew through and pay minimum rent of approximately million per year which rent may increase based on payment of percentage rents beginning july based on increases in revenues over a base period 
homestead also posted a security deposit equal to one year s rent 
as a result of payment of the million mortgage note  eight properties which were used as collateral for the mortgage note were subsequently pledged as collateral for its working capital facilities  described below  to draw approximately million in additional borrowings under the line 

on march   homestead renewed its working capital facilities with an extension of the maturity date to december  
on march   homestead announced a rights offering for million of common stock  the proceeds of which will be used to first repay the million bridge facility and then for purposes allowed under the working capital facilitites 
security capital will participate in the rights offering 
to the extent rights remain available security capital has agreed to purchase enough shares in the rights offering to ensure that the proceeds of the offering are no less than million  based on current market prices and subject to final documentation 
to the extent homestead raises proceeds of up to million in the rights offering from third parties or security capital which are used to repay the bridge facility  security capital s obligation under its subscription agreement for homestead convertible subordinated debentures will be reduced or terminated 
in addition to the extension noted above  homestead s working capital facilities were amended 
the line secured by suburban properties has been increased to million total borrowing capacity from million and the sliding interest terms amended to be to over libor and to over prime or to over the federal funds rate 
future additional collateral will be limited to suburban properties which are construction complete and stabilized 
the line secured by urban properties has been decreased to million total borrowing capacity from million and the interest terms amended to over libor and over prime or over the federal funds rate 
the renewed and amended working capital facilities require maintenance of the following financial covenants effective with first quarter 
limiting total liabilities of no more than of gross asset value  as defined  
limiting total indebtedness of no more than of gross asset value  as defined  
maintaining various ratios of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined  to interest expense ranging from to to to  
maintaining various ratios of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined  to debt service and preferred stock dividends ranging from to to to  
maintaining various ratios of net property operating income to implied debt service  as defined  ranging from to to to  
maintaining a minimum tangible net worth  as defined  of no less than of the year end amount  as defined  adjusted for net proceeds of equity offerings  and 
maintaining positive net sources and uses of funds 
in addition  under the renewed and amended working capital facilities distributions or dividends on equity are prohibited  total cost  as defined  of projects in development cannot exceed of gross asset value  as defined  in or in  homestead s business activities will be limited to development  ownership and operation of extended stay hotels  and no other additional indebtedness other than non recourse indebtedness may be incurred 
in addition to properties under construction at december   homestead also owned development sites and had an additional sites under contractual control 
costs to develop the sites owned are estimated at million 
costs to acquire and develop the sites under contractual control are estimated at million 
capital resources in addition to those described above will be needed to fund future developments  land acquisitions  and to repay or refinance existing debt upon its maturity 
homestead may  subject to lender consent  seek additional credit facilities and may seek to issue additional debt or equity securities under its existing shelf registration statement  or otherwise 
however  there is no assurance that homestead will be able to obtain such financing when required or on acceptable terms 
if homestead cannot secure adequate funding or complete other development arrangements then it may have to discontinue the development process on some or all of the land sites owned resulting in expensing of carrying costs  such as interest and property taxes  and expensing of costs of its internal development group  which could materially adversely affect reported earnings 
similarly  if pursuits of some or all of the land sites are abandoned homestead may incur write offs of pursuit costs and loss of non refundable earnest money deposits 
if discontinuance of development of land sites is required or pursuits of land sites for acquisition are abandoned due to financing constraints  then homestead intends to mitigate incurrence of expenses and cash outflows by seeking to sell land sites  sell and assign rights to acquire sites under pursuit  terminate personnel  or take other appropriate actions  all of which may result in additional losses for financial statement purposes 
operating activities net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to and million for as compared to these increases are due primarily to the growing number of homestead operating properties as described under results of operations for the years ended december    as well as improvements in operations 
impact of year the year issue has arisen as many existing computer programs and chip based embedded technology systems use only the last two digits to refer to a year  and therefore do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
homestead has adopted a year compliance program in an attempt to minimize or prevent the number and seriousness of any disruptions that may occur as a result of the year issue 
homestead s compliance program includes an assessment of its hardware and software computer systems information technology systems and embedded systems non information technology systems such as lighting  security  fire  card keys  phones  irrigation  elevators  and heating  ventilation  and air conditioning systems  as well as an assessment of the year issues relating to third parties with which homestead has a material relationship or whose systems are material to the operations of homestead s properties 
homestead s computer hardware  operating systems  general accounting  property management systems and principal desktop software applications are year compliant as certified by the various vendors 
homestead is currently testing these information technology systems  and expects to complete the testing phase by april  based on initial testing  management does not anticipate any year issues that will materially impact operations or operating results 
homestead s property management system database software is non compliant 
however  the property management system software vendor has stated that the property management system does not use the date routines associated with the underlying database software 
validation will be completed by april  if the property management system does not pass the validation tests  an upgrade will be necessary 
the cost to complete the upgrade  if it is necessary to upgrade  would approximate  and it is expected the upgrade would be completed by end of the third quarter homestead s critical non information technology systems have been inventoried and are being assessed for year compliance by contacting the vendors of the systems 
all non information technology systems are expected to be in compliance by the end of the second quarter homestead has surveyed its financial institutions and major vendors to determine the extent to which homestead is vulnerable to third parties failure to resolve their year issues 
homestead will be able to more adequately assess its third party risk when responses are received from the majority of the entities contacted 
management believes its planning efforts are adequate to address the year issue and that its risks are primarily those that it cannot directly control  including the readiness of its major vendors and financial institutions 
homestead s most reasonably likely worst case scenario is the failure on the part of these entities to become year compliant which could result in disruption in the homestead s cash receipt and disbursement functions  utilities and the failure of reservation systems 
there can be no guarantee  however  that the systems of unrelated entities upon which the homestead s operations rely will be corrected on a timely basis and will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
homestead does not have a formal contingency plan or a timetable for implementing one 
contingency plans will be established  if they are deemed necessary  after homestead has adequately assessed the impact on operations should third parties fail to properly respond to their year issues 
homestead s historical costs for addressing the year issue are not material and management does not anticipate that its future costs associated with the year issue will be material 
third party costs and software upgrades or replacements for year issues are not expected to exceed  homestead does not separately track the internal costs incurred for year compliance issues 
such costs are principally the related payroll costs of its information technology group 
although the cost of recently replacing homestead s key information technology systems was substantial  the replacements were made to improve operational efficiency and were not accelerated due to the year issue 
homestead has not delayed any material projects as a result of the year issue 
funds expended to address the year issue have been made from operating cash flow 
there can be no assurances that year remediation by homestead or third parties will be properly and timely completed  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on homestead  its business and its financial condition 
homestead cannot predict the actual effects to it of the year problem  which depends on numerous uncertainties such as i whether significant third parties properly and timely address the year issue and ii whether broad based or systemic economic failures may occur 
failures could include disruptions in passenger transportation or transportation systems generally  loss of utility and or telecommunications services  the loss or disruption of hotel reservations made on centralized reservation systems and errors or failures in financial transactions or payment processing systems such as credit cards 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem and the company s dependence on third parties  homestead is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company 
homestead s year compliance program is expected to significantly reduce the level of uncertainty about the year issue and management believes that the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
seasonality and inflation based upon the operating history of homestead properties  management believes that occupancy and revenues may be lower than normal during the months of december and january due to the holiday season 
because many of homestead s expenses do not fluctuate with occupancy  such declines in occupancy and revenues may cause fluctuations or decreases in homestead s earnings during these periods 
the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenue or operating results of homestead in there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not affect future operating or construction costs 
environmental matters homestead is not aware of  nor does it expect  any environmental condition on its properties to have a material adverse effect upon its business  results of operations or financial position 
dividends the board intends to follow a policy of retaining earnings to finance homestead s growth and for general corporate purposes and  therefore  does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  homestead s line of credit arrangements restrict payment of dividends without lender approval 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk homestead s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its lines of credit facilities and variable rate mortgage note debt 
homestead has no involvement with derivative financial instruments 
the table below provides information about homestead s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including estimated fair values for homestead s interest rate sensitive liabilities as of december  as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider exposures which could arise after that date 
moreover  because there were no firm commitments to actually sell the obligations at fair value as of december   the information presented has limited predictive value 
as a result  homestead s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period and prevailing interest rates 
dollar amounts in the following table are in thousands 
expected maturity principal repayment nominal december  interest total fair rate thereafter balance value interest sensitive liabilities lines of credit facilities variable rates    convertible mortgage notes fixed rate    mortgage note payable variable rate    other long term obligation fixed rate    on march   homestead obtained an extension and amendment of its working capital facilities  outstanding in the above amounts to a december  due date 
the working capital facilities interest terms were amended resulting in the borrowings under the lines  based on the present borrowings to collateral leverage ratio  bearing interest at over libor 
the million of borrowings outstanding under the bridge facility presently bear interest at over libor 
on march  homestead announced a rights offering of common stock  the proceeds of which will be used to repay the bridge facility and reduce the amounts outstanding under the working capital facilities 
the million mortgage note scheduled to mature june was repaid with the proceeds of a sale lease back transaction on february  the note bore interest at libor plus at december  the estimated fair value of obligations extending beyond a one year maturity as of december  were calculated by discounting the stream of cash payments of each obligation using a rate which  in management s judgement  represents an interest rate obtainable by homestead as of december  on a similar instrument
