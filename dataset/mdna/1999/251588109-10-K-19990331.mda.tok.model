liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our working capital needs from operations and bank borrowings 
in the contracting business  we expend considerable funds for equipment  labor and supplies 
our capital needs are greatest at the start of a new contract  since we generally must complete to days of work before receiving the first progress payment 
as a project continues  a portion of the progress billing is usually withheld as retainage until the work is complete 
we sometimes provide long term financing to customers who have previously utilized our contracting services 
accounts receivable for concrete and related products are typically outstanding for days or longer 
our business requires a continuing investment in plant and equipment  along with the related maintenance and upkeep costs 
management believes our cash flow from operations  existing working capital  and funds available from lines of credit will be adequate to meet our needs during the next months 
as of december   our liquidity and capital resources included cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
included in working capital is million of equipment and real estate held for sale 
although management intends to sell these assets during  there can be no assurance that they will be sold 
as of december   total outstanding liabilities of million compares to million as of december  as of december   available lines of credit totaled million 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  the primary sources of cash for the period were a  reduction in other current assets and a  reduction in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million in purchases of property  plant  and equipment were million 
the purchases were almost completely financed through equipment financing 
we turned our fiscal year end accounts receivable  excluding notes and employee receivables  approximately times in compared to times in the improvement resulted from increased contracting activity which normally has a higher turnover ratio 
however  the concrete division decreased its ratio slightly 
the company entered into a credit agreement with a caribbean bank in november for a total credit of million 
one part of the credit agreement is a term loan for million repayable in monthly installments through november we had million of borrowings outstanding on this loan at december  the second part is a revolving line of credit of million 
the credit line has a review and re approval process in july of each year until we had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at december  the interest rate on amounts borrowed under both loans varies with the prime rate 
we have a  unsecured overdraft facility from a commercial bank in the caribbean 
the facility is due on demand and bears interest at percent per annum 
at december   the company had borrowings of  outstanding under this line 
at december  we had borrowed approximately million from the company president 
the note is unsecured and bears interest at a rate variable with the prime rate 
one hundred sixty three thousand is due on demand and million is due on january  we purchase equipment as needed for our ongoing business operations 
we are currently replacing or upgrading some equipment used by the concrete and related products division  principally concrete trucks and quarry equipment 
this should result in a net cash expenditure  after financing part of the equipment purchases  of approximately million 
at present  management believes that our inventory of construction equipment is adequate for our current contractual commitments and operating activities 
new construction contracts may  depending on the nature of the contract and job location and duration  require us to make significant investments in heavy construction equipment 
during  we sold equipment and a marina with an original cost basis of approximately million and a net book value of million 
the net proceeds were approximately million 
we believe we have available or can obtain sufficient financing for most of our contemplated equipment replacements and additions 
historically  we have used a number of lenders to finance a portion of our machinery and equipment purchases 
at december   amounts outstanding to these lenders totaled million 
these loans are typically repaid over a three to five year term in monthly principal and interest installments 
a significant portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates 
a substantial increase in interest rates could negatively impact us 
our notes receivable and accrued interest at december  include million in promissory notes from the government of antigua with million classified as a current receivable 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if not addressed  such computer systems  software products and embedded technology may be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause system failures or miscalculations and lead to disruptions in our activities and operations 
during we have assessed our computer information systems 
the majority of our systems are purchased from outside vendors 
those installed systems  which are not currently able to fully function in the year  either have new versions which are year compliant or the vendor has committed to a year compliant release in sufficient time to allow installation and testing prior to critical cut over dates 
we have identified three major areas determined to be critical for successful year compliance bullet information systems such as pcs  networks  batch plant computers bullet third party relationships  including customers  suppliers  and government agencies bullet equipment which may contain microprocessors with embedded technology we have taken an inventory of all computers and software and we are planning the changes needed for these systems to become year compliant 
we are currently implementing a new information system for our financial reporting  and we are evaluating proposals from various vendors in respect to distribution systems for the island subsidiaries 
we believe that all conversion efforts will be completed before the end of we have started the process of contacting suppliers and customers regarding their year compliance status 
our contact includes questioning them about imbedded micro processors 
we have initiated a year contingency plan development process to mitigate potential disruptions in our activities and operations that may be created by failures of critical business partners  equipment and internal systems 
these contingency plans are expected to be developed by the third quarter of however  we can provide no assurance that it will correctly anticipate the level  impact or duration of non compliance by critical business partners  equipment or internal systems  or that contingency plans will be sufficient to mitigate the impact of non compliance 
we estimate to spend around  on our year project 
this consists of pc s  software and other related costs 
we cannot assure that our systems or the computer systems of other companies with whom we conduct business will be year compliant prior to december  management has determined that making the required system changes will have no material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
