item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references to  and mean the fiscal years ended january   january  and december   respectively 
overview in  and  the company reported net income of   and  respectively 
during early  all company indebtedness for money borrowed was subject to forbearance agreements with the company s us and swiss lenders which had been entered into as a result of significant operating losses incurred by the company in and the first half of  including by subsidiaries and other business operations disposed of in in june  the company replaced its us lenders  and in early it negotiated revised financing arrangements with its swiss lenders 
the us forbearance agreement was terminated in june and the swiss forbearance agreement on march   and today the company enjoys normal relationships with all of its lenders 
since mid  the company s results have improved significantly  and it has reported fourteen consecutive quarters in which net income has exceeded net income in the comparable prior year period 
cash flow from operations has been strong  enabling the company to reduce its debt by  in   in and  in in july  the company also repurchased  shares of its common stock for  on january   the company repurchased an additional  shares of its common stock for  which was funded by a combination of cash in the amount of  and bank borrowings of  k tron is an international company which derived approximately  and of its  and revenues  respectively  from products manufactured in  and services performed from  its facilities located outside the united states  primarily in europe 
as such  the financial position and performance of the company is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange rates  which can affect both the translation of financial statement items into us dollars and the impact of transactions where the revenues and related expenses may initially be accounted for in different currencies  such as sales made from the company s swiss manufacturing facilities in currencies other than the swiss franc 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year total revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating income interest 
income before income taxes year end backlog at year end foreign exchange rates  in thousands    as noted above under the overview  more than half of the company s revenues are normally derived from activities in foreign jurisdictions 
consequently  the company s results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates  particularly in us dollar exchange rates with respect to the swiss franc and german mark and  to a lesser degree  the british pound sterling  french franc and other currencies 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based sales increases 
correspondingly  the non us dollar value of non us dollar based costs increases when the non us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
overall  the company typically receives a majority of its revenues in currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide  especially those identified above 
accordingly  changes in foreign exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may adversely affect the company s total revenues  gross profit and operating income as expressed in us dollars 
in addition  revenues and income of the company with respect to particular transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility manufacturing the product subject to the sale  including in particular the us dollar swiss franc for inter company transactions and german mark swiss franc for sales from the company s swiss manufacturing facilities which are made in german marks exchange rates

the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations during the last three years 
the company s backlog increased by at the end of compared to at constant foreign exchange rates  primarily due to increased order volume at the united states and european manufacturing facilities 
whereas in prior years the bulk of the company s backlog has represented orders that will be ready for delivery in less than days  this was not the case at the end of the year end backlog consisted of orders most of which will be delivered in  but only about of such backlog is expected to be shipped in the first quarter of the company s backlog decreased by at the end of compared to at constant foreign exchange rates  primarily due to reduced order volume for shipment to customers in the united states

readiness for year the company has substantially completed an evaluation of its information technology infrastructure for year compliance and has substantially implemented its year compliance strategy 
the cost to modify its information technology infrastructure to be year compliant has not been and is not expected to be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not anticipate any material disruptions in its business as a result of any failure by the company to be year compliant 
the company anticipates having all systems year compliant no later than september  and has not developed a contingency plan 
if year compliance issues are discovered  the company then will evaluate the need for a contingency plan relative to those issues 
the company is also in the process of obtaining information concerning the year compliance status of its significant suppliers  customers and business partners to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to these third parties failure to remedy their year problems 
there can be no assurance that such suppliers  customers and business partners are or will be year compliant 
the risk to the company resulting from the failure of third parties in the public and private sector to attain year readiness is the same as for other firms in the company s industry or other business enterprises generally and could involve many different types of disruption to the company s business 
the costs to complete the company s year evaluation and to secure year compliance are based on management s best estimates 
these estimates were derived using numerous assumptions  including continued availability of resources  third party contingency plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the following are representative of the types of risks that could result in the event a critical component of the company s information systems  factories or facilities fails to be year ready  or there is a similar failure by one or more major third party suppliers to the company i information systems could include interruptions or disruptions of business and transaction processing such as customer billing  payroll  accounts payable and other operating and information processes  until systems can be remedied or replaced  ii factories and facilities could include interruptions or disruptions of manufacturing processes and facilities with delays in delivery of products  until non compliant conditions or components can be remedied or replaced  and iii major suppliers to the company could include interruptions or disruptions of the supply of materials and supplies which could cause interruptions or disruptions of manufacturing and delays in delivery of products  until the third party supplier can remedy the problem or contingency measures can be implemented 
european monetary union euro on january   the eleven member countries of the european union  which does not include switzerland  established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro began trading on currency exchanges  but the legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period  non cash payments can be made in the euro  and parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that they will no longer be available 
the company has been planning for the euro s introduction and has not encountered significant difficulties with the euro 
since the company s sales in europe are from two manufacturing plants located in switzerland  and since some sales are made in swiss francs and others in local currencies  the relationship of the euro to the swiss franc will be important to the company  just as the relationship of the swiss franc to the german mark has been important in the past 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
the company is assessing its pricing and marketing strategies in order to ensure that it remains competitive in the european market 
the company also implemented a new information technology system in europe on january  to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and also for the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies  and is reviewing whether any existing contracts will need to be modified 
the company s foreign currency exchange risk in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
the company will continue to evaluate issues involving the introduction of the euro  including accounting  tax and legal issues 
based on current information and the company s current assessment  the company does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition
