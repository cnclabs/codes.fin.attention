the following discussion explains the changes in net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used for investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities which are presented in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows 
operating activities for the year ended december   the company s cash flow from operating activities increased million over the same period last year 
this increase is primarily due to the increased operating income from the company s acquired communities  as well as increases in property operating income within the company s same community portfolio achieved primarily through higher rental rates as discussed below and under results of operations 
investing activities for the year ended december   net cash used for investing activities was million compared to million for  a decrease of million 
changes in the level of investing activities from period to period primarily reflect the changing levels of the company s acquisition  capital expenditure  development and sales programs 
acquisitions the company seeks to acquire communities in individual or portfolio transactions that can provide returns on investment property rental income less property operating expenses divided by the average capital investment in real estate substantially in excess of the company s cost of capital by the third year of ownership

fl heron lake   seattle  wa aspen creek   total weighted average    mergers on march   the company completed the acquisition of asr investments corporation asr in a statutory merger the asr merger 
asr was a publicly traded multifamily reit that owned communities with  apartment homes located in arizona  texas  new mexico and the state of washington 
the acquisition was structured as a tax free transaction and was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes 
no goodwill was recorded in connection with this transaction 
in connection with the acquisition  the company acquired primarily real estate assets totaling million 
each share of asr s common stock was exchanged for shares of the company s common stock 
consideration given by the company included  shares of the company s common stock valued at per share for an aggregate equity value of million plus the issuance of  op units in the heritage communities  lp valued at million 
in addition  the company assumed  at fair value  mortgage debt totaling million and other liabilities of million 
the aggregate purchase price in the asr merger was million  including transaction costs 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of american apartment communities ii aac in a statutory merger the aac merger 
in connection with the acquisition of aac  the company acquired communities with  apartment homes located primarily in california  the pacific northwest  the midwest and florida 
the aac merger was structured as a tax free merger and was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes

the aggregate purchase price in the aac merger was million  including transaction costs 
the aac merger and asr merger established the company as a national owner of apartment communities 
these two transactions enabled the company to enter into new markets in the pacific northwest  california  colorado and the midwest 
entry into these markets provides the company with market diversification and reduces cyclical risks by making the company less dependent on any one market 
real estate under development consistent with the company s acquisition strategy  development activity is focused in certain of its major markets 
during  the company increased its level of development activity  completing the development of apartment homes in two additional phases to existing communities and apartment homes in four new communities

during  the company expects to invest approximately million on the development  including communities currently under development plus six new starts during the year 
capital expenditures the company capitalizes value enhancing improvements plus improvements that substantially extend the useful life of an existing asset 
in addition to the company s capital expenditures on new acquisitions  a significant portion of capital expenditures relate to the company s same communities 
these capital expenditures include an upgrade program and other initiatives which began in and are considered revenue enhancing or expense reducing 
during  the company invested million on capital improvements to its apartment portfolio which include an upgrade program and other initiatives that began in for the same community apartments those owned prior to january   capital expenditures averaged  per home as follows i ordinary capital expenditures including floor coverings  hvac equipment  roofs  appliances and other ordinary capital expenditures of million or per home  ii asset preservation expenditures including landscaping  parking lots and other land improvements of million or per home and iii revenue enhancing expenditures including sub metering of water and sewer  interior improvements and upgrades  construction of carports  garages and self storage units  business and fitness centers  security alarms  gating and access devices and intrusion alarms  washer and dryer connections and other revenue enhancing expenditures of million or per home 
the company has completed most of its same community upgrade program and will reduce its capital expenditures related to same communities during  but will continue to selectively add revenue enhancing improvements which can provide a high return on investment 
disposition of investments the company continually undertakes portfolio review analyses with the objective of identifying communities that do not meet the company s long term investment objectives due to size  location  age  quality and or performance 
these sales allow the company to reduce the age of its existing portfolio  which should result in lower operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with the older communities and to exit non core markets 
since  the company has sold communities with  non strategic apartment homes average age of communities sold was years  the net proceeds from which were used to acquire and develop newer communities that will provide higher long term returns on investment than the communities that are being sold 
the sales are initially dilutive to earnings as the initial returns on investment on higher quality apartments are lower than the returns on investment on the communities being sold 
during  the sales program had approximately a 
per share dilutive impact on the company s net income available to common shareholders 
during  the company transferred communities and one commercial property aggregating million  net of accumulated depreciation and valuation allowance  from real estate held for investment to real estate held for disposition 
during  the company sold communities with  apartment homes and one shopping center for an aggregate sales price of million 
for income tax purposes  of the community sales were structured to qualify as a like kind exchange under section of the internal revenue code  so the related capital gain will be deferred for federal income tax purposes 
net proceeds of approximately million were primarily used to fund acquisitions 
the company intends to sell  to  apartment homes during to complete the sale of non strategic assets 
it is anticipated that the net proceeds from the sales  estimated between million to million  will be used to fund acquisitions in order to complete tax deferred exchanges to defer large capital gains  to fund development activity and repay mortgage debt 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during was million compared to million for cash provided by financing activities during the first quarter of  the company entered into two separate transactions to sell its common stock to unit investment trusts uit 
in february  the company issued million shares of its common stock at a gross sales price of per share to a uit 
in march  the company issued million shares of its common stock at a gross sales price of to a second uit 
the net proceeds from the two uit s aggregating million were primarily used to curtail bank debt 
the company issued  shares of its common stock and received million under its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan during  which included million in optional cash investments and million of reinvested distributions 
on november   the company sold an aggregate million of senior unsecured notes payable in two simultaneous but separate public offerings which consisted of the following i million of notes due november  and ii million including the over allotment option of monthly income notes due november  net proceeds from the two offerings net of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses of approximately million were used to repay bank debt outstanding under the company s various credit facilities and to fund the acquisition of aac 
in january  the company established a program for the sale of up to million aggregate principal amount of medium term notes the mtn program 
the company subsequently sold an aggregate of million of senior unsecured notes under the mtn program which consisted of the following i million of notes due january   ii million of notes due january   iii million of variable rate notes due january  on which the company subsequently executed a swap fixing the rate at and iv million of notes due february  net proceeds from the offerings were used to repay revolving bank debt and prepay mortgage debt 
the company anticipates issuing the remaining million of notes under the mtn program during the first half of  the net proceeds of which will be used to repay a senior unsecured note maturing in april the company is currently negotiating a million five year variable rate revolving credit agreement the credit facility with a lender through which the company will have access to secured funding through federal national mortgage association 
the proceeds from the credit facility will be used to repay a million secured credit facility assumed in connection with the aac transaction and repay unsecured bank debt 
additional features of this credit facility may allow the company to extend the maturity for five or ten years and increase the amount available under the credit facility to million 
it is anticipated that this credit facility will be executed during the first quarter of derivative instruments the company  from time to time  uses derivative instruments to synthetically alter on balance sheet liabilities or to hedge anticipated financing transactions 
in order to reduce the interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of unsecured notes during  the company entered into a million notional amount fixed pay forward starting swap agreement interest rate risk management agreement with a major wall street investment banking firm in july the company settled the interest rate risk management agreement on november   by paying million to the counterparty 
the company was unable to issue the unsecured notes contemplated by the interest rate risk management agreement because of changed market conditions  and accordingly  the cost associated with the settlement of this agreement was expensed during the fourth quarter of market risk disclosures the company is exposed to market risk principally from interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced 
the company does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes  but rather  holds these financial instruments to finance owning and managing real estate 
the company s interest rate sensitivity position is managed by its treasury department 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and changes in rate sensitive income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates on its variable rate debt and the repricing of fixed rate debt maturities 
a large portion of the company s market risk is exposure to short term interest rates from variable rate borrowings outstanding under its various credit facilities  which was million at december  the impact on the company s financial statements of refinancing fixed rate debt that matured during was not material 
at december   the notional value of the company s derivative products for the purpose of managing interest rate risk was million of interest rate swaps which have an average pay rate fixed at to and an average receive rate of one month to three month libor 
these agreements effectively fix million of the company s variable rate secured notes payable to a weighted average interest rate of 
at december   the fair market value of the interest rate swaps in an unfavorable value position to the company was million 
if interest rates were basis points more or less at december   the fair market value would have been  and million  respectively 
if market interest rates for variable rate debt average basis points more in than they did during  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements  would increase  and income before taxes would decrease by million 
comparatively  if market interest rates for variable rate debt averaged basis points more in than it did in  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swap agreements  would have increased  and income before taxes would have decreased by million 
if market rates for fixed rate debt were basis points higher at december   the fair value of fixed rate debt would have decreased from billion to billion 
if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were basis points lower at december   the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from billion to billion 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
credit facilities the company has a million three year unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility  a million one year unsecured line of credit the line of credit and a million uncommitted line of credit with a major us financial institution 
under the credit facility  pricing is based upon the higher of the company s senior unsecured debt ratings from s p and moody s which are currently bbb and baa  respectively 
at these rating levels  contractual interest under the credit facility is libor plus basis points 
the credit facility also includes a million competitive bid option which allows the company to solicit bids from participating banks at rates below the contractual rate 
the credit facility and line of credit are subject to customary financial covenants and limitations 
at and for the year ended december   the company had the following credit facilities dollars in thousands twelve months ended december  at december  weighted average amount of amount weighted average amount weighted average credit facility facility outstanding interest rate outstanding interest rate credit facility    line of credit    uncommitted line   funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined as income before gains losses on sales of investments  minority interests and extraordinary items computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles plus real estate depreciation  less preferred dividends and after adjustment for significant non recurring items 
the company computes ffo in accordance with the recommendations set forth by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
the company considers ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance  and believes that ffo should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income and cash flows as a measure of the company s operating performance and liquidity 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
for  ffo increased to million  compared with million during for  ffo increased to million  compared with million for the increase in ffo for both periods was principally due to the increased property operating income from the company s non mature apartment homes that were acquired and developed

these non mature apartment homes provided a substantial portion of the aggregate reported increases 
however  these increases were moderated in part due to the company s financing activities during as the company financed its acquisition and development activity primarily with common and preferred equity and the proceeds from property sales rather than debt which was used to finance much of the acquisition and development programs

compared to the same period last year  property rental income grew  or approximately million  reflecting an increase in average monthly rental rates of to per month while physical occupancy of remained stable compared to last year 
management believes a portion of the rent growth reflects the impact of the company s upgrade and revenue enhancing capital expenditure programs 
it is anticipated that there will be a slowdown in the us economic growth  while new apartment completions increase 
as a result  the company expects a modest decline in occupancy and slightly lower rent growth during the company expects to maintain rent growth in the range and physical occupancy in the range during for  property operating expenses at these same communities decreased  or  the decline is primarily the result of the following i utility expenses decreased million  which is directly attributable to the company s water and sewer sub metering initiative where local and state regulations allow and ii an overall decrease in repair and maintenance expenses of million 
the decrease in repair and maintenance expenses occurred as the company continued to benefit from its upgrade program and centralized purchasing initiatives 
however  these decreases were offset by increases in real estate taxes  personnel costs and property management expenses 
real estate taxes increased million primarily in certain florida and texas markets 
personnel costs increased million as the company experienced pressure on wages due to low unemployment and tighter job markets  particularly in the service area 
in addition  the company s cost of property management increased million as a result of the added infrastructure costs in areas such as information technology  human resources and training  and the cost of entering new markets in new regions of the country during the company s objective is for operating expenses to be unchanged in primarily as a result of lower utility expenses due to the continuing transfer of water and sewer costs to the resident

the cost of property management increased million as the company invested heavily in its personnel and technological infrastructure during in response to growth 
however  these expense increases were offset by decreases in repair and maintenance expense and utility expense 
repair and maintenance expense decreased or approximately million primarily as a result of less exterior painting  extraordinary repairs  mechanical repairs and the effect of the upgrade program

the annualized return on investment for the single acquisitions on an average investment of million was 
these results were below the company s full year forecasted return on investment of primarily as a result of market softness in san antonio and phoenix where the company acquired communities in however  it is expected that these communities will experience improved operating results in as improvements are completed

the annualized return on investment for the asr properties was on an average investment of million during the under performance of this portfolio is primarily attributable to weak markets and seasonality in the phoenix tuscon albuquerque markets  however  certain assets are undergoing upgrading and repositioning that is expected to improve operating results in while the phoenix and tuscon markets suffer temporarily from an abundance of supply in the apartment sector  the company believes in these markets over the long term

year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company continues to identify and address issues regarding the transition to year  as it is dependent on computer systems and applications to conduct its business 
the company has performed a thorough assessment of its personal computers  desktop software and major applications and is in the process of completing its server environment assessment 
to ensure that the company completed a formalized and thorough assessment of its year issues  the company engaged an outside consulting firm to conduct a year assessment and develop a remediation plan 
the plans covers four stages i inventory  ii assessment  iii remediation and iv testing and certification 
because the company operates in a structured  standardized environment  the assessment indicated a high degree of year compliance with few items for remediation 
all mission critical applications have been determined to be year compliant 
desktop hardware and software are compliant  with remediation of the non compliant to be completed by july none of the non compliant issues identified are mission critical 
the company is commencing the assessment phase for non it operating equipment at its communities gates  security  telephone  elevator  hvac systems and other such systems 
this assessment will be completed by may   with any remediation to be completed by november  the company is also assessing the year compliance of vendors and other external relationships to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to such parties failure to resolve their own year issues 
the company has initiated formal communication with these parties 
the company cannot insure timely compliance of third parties and  therefore  could be adversely affected by failure of a significant third party to become year compliant 
the effect  if any  on the company s results of operations from the failure of such third parties to be year compliant is not reasonably estimable 
the company estimates that the total year project cost will be approximately  of which approximately has been incurred as of december  amounts expended to ensure year compliance have been funded by cash flows from operations and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company believes that its year initiatives are adequate to address reasonably likely year issues 
assessment remediation testing complete compliance expected completion it mission critical applications july it desktop hardware software july it network hardware software july operating equipment  expected completion  expected at communities may completion  november july failure to correct a material year problem could result in the failure of certain normal business activities or operations 
management believes that  with the implementation of new or upgraded business systems  as needed  and the completion of the year project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations due to the failure of those systems will be reduced 
however  the company is dependent on the power and telecommunications infrastructure within the united states 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be that the company may experience disruption in its operations if any of the third party suppliers reported a system failure 
although the company s year project will reduce the level of uncertainty about the compliance and readiness of its material third party providers  due to the general uncertainty over year readiness of these third party suppliers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact 
the final phase of the company s year project relates to a contingency plan 
the company maintains contingency plans in the normal course of business designed to be deployed in the event of various potential business interruptions
