year computer matter the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or customer reservations or engage in similar normal business activities 
management has determined that the year issue will not pose material operational problems for its computer systems 
management expects that costs incurred in connection with the year issue  including  but not limited to all costs of ensuring year compliance for the financial system software at both its atlanta  georgia headquarters and the marion  illinois offices of its wholly owned management company subsidiary should not exceed  and in any event  does not expect such costs to have a material adverse impact on the results of operations during any quarterly or annual reporting period 
in addition  management has recently converted the reservation systems that it acquired as part of the best inns acquisition to operate with the microtel reservation system 
usfs anticipates that it will cease having any dependency on the acquired best inns systems by june  finally  management has determined that the computer systems at certain usfs managed hotel properties are not currently year compliant 
management expects to achieve compliance at its managed properties by july  the company is in the process of communicating with its significant suppliers of goods and services to determine the extent to which the company s operations and systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s operations and systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems or results of operations 
the company will utilize both external and internal resources to reprogram  or replace  and test its software for year modifications 
the company anticipates completing the year projects by july   which is prior to any anticipated material adverse impact on its operating systems 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
seasonality 
royalties generated by gross room revenues of franchised properties are expected to be the largest source of revenue for the company for the immediate future 
the company expects to experience seasonal revenue patterns similar to those experienced by the lodging industry generally 
the summer months  because of increase in leisure travel  are expected to produce higher revenues for the company than other periods 
accordingly  the company may experience lower revenues and profits in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenues and profits in the second and third quarters 
inflation 
the rate of inflation has not had a material effect on the revenues or operating results of the company since its inception 
reservations and advertising funds during  the company created independent reservations and advertising not for profit corporations owned by its franchisees the funds for the purpose of collecting and disbursing reservations and advertising fees related to the microtel and hawthorn brands 
in connection with the creation of the funds  the company ceased reporting reservations and advertising fees and expenses within its consolidated financial statements effective april  any deficits arising from reservations and advertising operations for quarterly periods prior to april  have been included in general and administrative expenses 
the new presentation is considered preferable to prior practice giving consideration to industry trends  to providing a consistent reporting policy among its brands and in understanding the company s operating performance 
the company manages the reservations and advertising programs on behalf of the funds  and has made interest bearing loans to the microtel fund to supplement reservation  advertising  and promotional efforts  and may make additional loans in the future 
the company also administers reservations and advertising programs on behalf of best inns franchisees by virtue of its management of best reservations corp  an illinois not for profit corporation 
risk factors in evaluating the company and its business  the following risks should be considered management of growth the company has experienced rapid growth in the number of its employees and the scope of its operations since its inception 
this growth has resulted in  and is expected to continue to create  new and increased responsibilities for management personnel  as well as added demands on the company s operating and financial systems 
the company s success will depend on its ability to manage this growth while implementing its strategy 
the efforts of key management personnel and the company s ability to attract or develop new management personnel and to integrate these new employees into its overall operations will be crucial to continued growth 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on  and obstacles to  hotel openings the company expects that in the future a principal source of revenues will be royalty fees received from its franchisees 
accordingly  future revenues will be highly dependent on the number of open hotels and their gross room revenues 
there are numerous factors beyond the control of the company which affect the probability of a hotel opening 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the ability of a potential hotel owner to i secure adequate financing or satisfy financing payments during the construction period  ii locate an appropriate site for a hotel  iii obtain all necessary state and local construction  occupancy or other permits and approvals and iv reach a satisfactory level of profitability at the hotel 
there can be no assurance that accepted franchise applications will result in executed franchise agreements or that executed franchise agreements will result in open properties 
limited operating history  net losses the company began operating in october and therefore has a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate its performance 
while the company believes that it has a well conceived strategy  that it has assembled an experienced and well qualified management team to implement this strategy  and that it was profitable in the second half of  there can be no assurance that it will be profitable in the future

successful completion and integration of acquisitions one element of the company s business strategy is to continuously evaluate acquisitions and business combinations 
these acquisitions may be of brands in the lodging industry or in other industries  or of businesses that the company does not expect to franchise  which would require the company to develop expertise in areas that it does not currently operate 
there can be no assurance that the company will identify and complete suitable acquisitions or if completed  that such acquisitions will be successfully integrated 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties assimilating new operations and brands 
there can be no assurance that any acquisitions would result in long term benefits to the company or that management would be able to manage effectively the resulting business 
dependence on senior management the success of the company is largely dependent on the efforts and abilities of its senior management and certain other key personnel  particularly messrs 
leven  aronson and steve romaniello  executive vice president franchise sales and administration 
the company s success will depend in large part on its ability to retain these individuals and other current members of its senior management team and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of members of senior management or of certain other key employees or the company s inability to retain other qualified employees could have an adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance on behalf of the lives of any of its officers or employees 
risks relating to microtel acquisition agreement the microtel acquisition agreement obligates the company to execute new franchise agreements and have open or under construction a specified number of microtels each year 
specifically  the microtel acquisition agreement requires that there are  on a cumulative basis  at least new microtels ie  not open or under construction at the date of the microtel acquisition agreement open or under construction by december  by december  by december  and by december as of december  there were new microtels open or under construction 
the microtel acquisition agreement further provides that if the company is unable to comply with the development schedule for two consecutive years but opens or has under construction at least of the number of microtels required by such schedule  the company may cure the default by making additional payments 
if the company fails to comply with this development schedule and to make the requisite cure payment or payments  all rights to the microtel system automatically revert to hudson 
there can be no assurance that the company will comply with the foregoing development schedule  and the company s failure to meet such schedule or to pay the requisite cure payments would have a material adverse effect on the company 
see business acquisition of the microtel  hawthorn suites and best inns systems microtel acquisition 
competition for new franchise properties and hotel guests competition among national brand franchisors and smaller chains in the lodging industry to grow their franchise systems is intense 
many of the company s competitors are affiliated with larger chains with substantially more properties  greater marketing budgets and greater brand identity than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company can franchise a sufficient number of properties to generate operating efficiencies that will enable it to compete with these larger chains 
see business competition 
general risks of the lodging industry the company is exposed to general risks of the lodging industry in a number of ways 
first  as a franchisor and manager  the company s franchise royalty and management fee revenues vary directly with its franchisees gross room revenues 
as a result  the company s franchise and management businesses are  and will be  impacted by the effects of risks experienced by hotel operators generally 
second  to the extent the company directly or indirectly makes equity or debt investments in hotel properties  those investments will be subject to the risks experienced by the underlying properties 
see business development fund  business acquisition of the microtel  hawthorn suites and best inns systems best inns acquisition  and risks relating to financing of franchisees 
third  the company may directly acquire ownership interests in its branded hotel properties in order to promote the brand or for other reasons 
to the extent that the company owns or leases hotel properties  it will be subjected to the risks of a hotel operator 
the segments in which hotels franchised under the company s brands currently operate or plan to operate  may be adversely affected by changes in national or local economic conditions and other local market conditions  such as an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for lodging or a scarcity of potential sites in a geographic area  changes is travel patterns  extreme weather conditions  changes in governmental regulations that influence or determine wages  prices  construction costs or methods of operation  changes in interest rates  the availability of financing  and changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses 
in addition  due in part to the strong correlation between the lodging industry s performance and economic conditions  the lodging industry is subject to cyclical changes in revenues and profits 
these risks may be exacerbated by the relatively illiquid nature of real estate holdings 
downturns or prolonged adverse conditions in real estate or capital markets or in national or local economies could have a material adverse impact on the company s ability to locate new franchisees 
in addition to the aforementioned risks  the company s current and potential future investments in or ownership of hotel properties creates a risk of decreased earnings due to losses related to start up expenses or ongoing losses due to shortfalls in expected performance of a hotel 
in addition  any guaranty required to secure construction or permanent loan financing could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
the company expects to experience seasonal revenue patterns similar to those experienced by participants in the lodging industry generally 
accordingly  the summer months  because of increases in leisure travel  are expected to produce higher revenues for the company than other periods during the year 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality 
development and ownership risk the company s success depends upon the development or conversion and opening of hotels 
as a result  it is subject to risks experienced by hotel developers 
these risks  which are applicable to microtels as new construction properties  and to hawthorn and best inns as both new construction and conversion properties  include delays in the commencement or completion of construction  failure to obtain all necessary zoning and construction permits  discovery of environmental hazards  unavailability of financing on favorable terms  if at all  the failure of developed properties to achieve desired revenue or profitability levels once opened  competition for suitable development sites from competing franchise chains  the risk of incurring substantial costs in the event a development project must be abandoned prior to completion  changes in governmental rules  regulations and interpretations and general economic and business conditions 
the company s revenues may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  which could increase the costs of financing new hotel construction or the conversion of existing hotels 
any one of these risks could discourage or prohibit potential franchisees from beginning or completing hotel projects 
to the extent the company leases and or owns hotel properties or makes  directly or indirectly  equity or debt investments in hotel properties  it would be subject to risks experienced by hotel operators generally 
risks relating to the financing of franchisees the company participates  from time to time  in construction loans  equity investments  and long term mortgage loans made to franchisees 
in particular  the company has committed to lend up to million to constellation to be invested by constellation in the development fund and to be used by the development fund to provide debt and equity financing to selected developers 
see business development fund 
in addition  the company made a million subordinated loan to ventures in connection with the best inns acquisition 
the company is also committed to make additional loans to ventures under certain circumstances 
the company expects ventures to be a highly leveraged entity and there can be no assurances that any loans to ventures will be repaid 
see business acquisition of the microtel  hawthorn suites and best inns systems best inns acquisition 
the company has also made various loans to individual franchisees  to the microtel reservation and advertising fund  and loan participations in a financing program with nomura asset capital corp 
the company is subject to the risks experienced by lenders generally  including risks of franchisee borrower defaults and bankruptcies 
in the event of a default under such loans  the company  as a lender  would bear the risk of loss of principal to the extent the value of the collateral was not sufficient to pay lenders which may be more senior in the capital structure 
in connection with equity investments  the company would be subject to risks as an equity investor 
see business regulation 
regulation the sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws  as well as by the ftc 
to the extent that the company manages  owns or leases hotel properties  it will be subject to additional governmental regulations 
for example  owners and operators of hotels are subject to numerous federal  state and local government regulations  including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages such as health and liquor license laws and building and zoning requirements 
under the americans with disabilities act of the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
the determination that hotels owned  managed or leased by the company are not in compliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines  and award of damages to private litigants or significant expense to the company in bringing these hotels into compliance 
additionally  various national  state and local laws and regulations may affect activities undertaken by the company in connection with providing financing to franchisees 
in particular  the company may be required to obtain a license or to register in certain states in order to arrange loans to be made to franchisees 
see business regulation 
dependence on spirit reservation system franchisees of the hawthorn brand derive approximately of their reservations through the spirit reservation system  which is operated under contract with hyatt hotels corporation by csc outsourcing  inc csc and sabre technology solutions sabre
