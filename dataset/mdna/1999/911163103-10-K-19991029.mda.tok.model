item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the leading independent national distributor of natural foods and related products in the united states 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the acquisition of or merger with natural products distributors  the opening of distribution centers in new geographic areas  the expansion of existing distribution centers and the continued growth of the natural products industry in general 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
our distribution operations are divided into four principal units united natural foods in the eastern region previously cornucopia natural foods  inc and stow mills  inc  rainbow natural foods  inc 
in the central region  mountain people s warehouse  inc in the western region and albert s organics in various markets in the united states 
through our subsidiary  the natural retail group  we also own and operate a number of retail natural products stores located in the eastern united states 
our retail strategy is to selectively acquire existing natural products stores that meet our strict criteria in areas such as sales growth  profitability  growth potential and store management 
we believe our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business enabling us to develop new marketing programs and improve customer service 
we are continually integrating certain operating functions in order to improve operating efficiencies  including i integrating administrative and accounting functions  ii expanding marketing and customer service programs across the three regions  iii expanding national purchasing opportunities  iv consolidating systems applications between physical locations and regions  and v reducing geographic overlap between regions 
in addition  our continued growth has created the need for expansion of existing facilities to achieve maximum operating efficiencies and to assure adequate space for future needs 
while operating margins may be affected in periods in which these expenses are incurred  over the long term  we expect to benefit from the increased absorption of our expenses over a larger sales base 
we have incurred considerable expenses in connection with the consolidation of operations in the eastern region  and expect these expenses to continue into fiscal these expenses consist of restructuring costs  including additional depreciation  severance and retention expenses  and the cost of moving inventory  as well as additional temporary expenses for information technology  inventory management and redundant staffing and transportation 
we have also made considerable expenditures in connection with the expansion of our facilities  including the relocation of our denver  colorado distribution center and the expansion of refrigerated and frozen space at our auburn  california and atlanta  georgia facilities 
additionally  our seattle  washington facility was relocated to a larger facility in auburn  washington during the third quarter of fiscal our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural products to retailers adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amount paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  administrative  depreciation  merger expenses and amortization expense 
other expenses include gain on the sale of retail stores  interest on outstanding indebtedness  interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses 
our operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal were negatively impacted by computer and related issues arising from the continuing consolidation of eastern region operations 
the consolidation resulted in increased operating expenses  a lower gross margin and lower sales than prior quarters in the eastern region 
we had a net loss of per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal excluding restructuring costs of approximately million for the quarter  net loss per share was 
the computer and related issues arising from the continuing consolidation of eastern region operations have continued into fiscal and we expect our operating results to continue to be negatively impacted 
recent acquisitions on september   we acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock of albert s organics  inc  a business specializing in the purchase  sale and distribution of produce and other perishable items  for million to million  predicated upon the future performance of the acquired business  including million of goodwill which we are amortizing over years 
the final price will be determined by march albert s had sales of million for the fiscal year ended december  and provides us with additional expertise in the purchasing of produce and other perishable items 
albert s also enables us to avail ourselves of a number of cross selling opportunities  which will be mutually beneficial to both businesses 
the acquisition of albert s has been accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  all financial information has been included since the date of acquisition 
our merger with stow mills in october has been accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  all information included herein is reported as though united natural and stow mills had been combined for all periods reported 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses merger and restructuring expenses amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense other  net total other expense income income before income taxes and extraordinary item income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary item loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of tax net income twelve months ended july  compared to twelve months ended july  net sales 
our net sales increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  the overall increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales to existing customers  the sale of new product offerings and the newly acquired albert s organics business 
excluding albert s organics  our most recent acquisition  our net sales growth would have been over the prior year comparable period

excluding the restructuring and merger costs noted above  operating income for the year ended july  and would have been million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively  resulting in a decrease for year ended july  of million  or  versus the comparable prior period 
other income expense 
the million decrease in other expense in the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  was primarily attributable to the million gain on the sale of four retail stores in april  partially offset by an increase in interest expense relating to the higher level of debt in fiscal used to fund working capital investments and the albert s acquisition 
this increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in our average interest rate on debt 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates were and for the year ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rate for was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes and the settlement of an irs audit for million 
the effective rate for was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes and non deductible merger expenses incurred in the first quarter of fiscal  partially offset by stow mills being an s corporation prior to the merger and  as such  having no federal tax expense for the first fiscal quarter of net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased by million to million  or of net sales  for the year ended july  from million in the year ended july  excluding the million in restructuring costs million  net of tax  the million gain on the sale of four retail stores million  net of tax and the million irs settlement in the third quarter of fiscal  and the million in merger costs in fiscal  net income would have been million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively  resulting in an decrease for the year ended july  of million  or  over the comparable prior period 
twelve months ended july  compared to twelve months ended july  net sales 
our net sales increased approximately  or million  to million for the twelve months ended july  from million for the twelve months ended july  the overall increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales to existing customers  sales to new accounts in existing geographic areas and the introduction of new products not previously offered

the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to our ability to leverage our overhead and realize synergies from recent acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or approximately  to million for the twelve months ended july  from million for the twelve months ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating income increased to in the twelve months ended july  from in the comparable period 
excluding the merger costs and relocation and start up costs noted above  operating income for the twelve months ended july  would have been million representing an increase of over the prior period  or of net sales 
other income expense 
the million decrease in other expense in the twelve months ended july  compared to the twelve months ended july  was primarily attributable to the reduction in interest expense in the first six months of fiscal relating to the repayment of stow mills debt with proceeds from our credit facility  which bears interest at a lower rate 
in addition  the proceeds from our secondary public offering in june were used to repay debt 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates were and for the twelve months ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rates were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible merger costs incurred during the first quarter of fiscal and state and local income taxes  partially offset by the fact that stow mills was an s corporation prior to the merger and  as such  had no federal tax expense 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  our net income increased by million to million for the twelve months ended july  from million in the twelve months ended july  excluding the million in merger costs and the million million  net of taxes in fiscal and million extraordinary item net of taxes related to the early extinguishment of debt in fiscal  net income would have been million representing an increase of over the prior period  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  for the twelve months ended july  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed operations and growth primarily from cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  seller financing of acquisitions  operating and capital leases  trade payables  bank indebtedness and the sale of equity and debt securities 
primary uses of capital have been acquisitions  expansion of plant and equipment and investment in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash provided by operations was million  million and million for the years ended july   and  respectively 
excluding merger expenses of million  net cash provided by operations in fiscal would have been million 
cash provided by operations in fiscal related primarily to cash collected from customers net of cash paid to vendors  partially offset by investments in accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business 
working capital at july  was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended july   and  respectively 
investing activities in fiscal and were primarily for the acquisition of new businesses and investing activities for all three years included the continued upgrade of existing management information systems 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of four retail stores in april cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended july   and  respectively 
we increased borrowings on our line of credit by million during fiscal  which was mostly offset by debt repayments totaling million 
the primary financing activities in fiscal were net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and proceeds of million from long term debt incurred 
net borrowings on our line of credit during fiscal of million were offset by repayments of long term debt totaling million 
the primary financing activities in fiscal were net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and proceeds of million from long term debt incurred 
the primary use of these proceeds was a net paydown of our line of credit totaling million and repayments of long term debt totaling million 
we expect to spend approximately million over the next five years in capital expenditures to fund the expansion of existing facilities  upgrade information systems and technology and update our material handling equipment 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a five year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million 
the five year term of the swap agreement may be extended to seven years at the option of the counterparty 
impact of inflation historically  the company has been able to pass along inflation related increases 
consequently  inflation has not had a material impact upon the results of the company s operations or profitability 
seasonality generally  the company does not experience any material seasonality 
however  the company s sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in the company s operating expenses  management s ability to execute the company s operating and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages and general economic conditions

year issues the following information constitutes year readiness disclosure under the year information and readiness disclosure act of we have completed an assessment of most of our internal exposure to the year issue 
we continue to assess our customer and vendor exposure 
generally  we believe we have year exposure in three areas o our information technology infrastructure  including computer operating systems and applications  o microprocessors and other electronic devices embedded chips included as components of non computer equipment  and o computer systems used by third parties  including our customers and suppliers 
the information technology infrastructure and embedded chips are being addressed on a regional level 
the third parties are being evaluated centrally on a company wide basis 
we have completed our assessment of our information technology infrastructure  and are in the process of completing our evaluation of all microprocessors and other electronic devices  third party vendors and customers 
our western region we believe that our western region s critical information technology infrastructure components and embedded chips are year compliant 
our western region does not utilize two digit date coding logic  and we have successfully tested hardware  operating system and applications software simulating post year dates 
we have tested our microprocessors and other electronic devices and have completed implementing changes designed to achieve year compliance 
the seattle facility s phone system was replaced for other business reasons during the third quarter of fiscal and is year compliant 
our central region we believe our central region s critical information technology infrastructure components and embedded chips are also year compliant 
our central region does not employ two digit date coding logic and has simulated year dates in tests of its hardware and operating systems as well as selected applications software 
we have completed all year simulation testing 
we have also completed an independent third party review of our central region s operating system and critical information technology applications software code which has indicated that they are year compliant 
the denver facility s telephone system was replaced in october and is now year compliant 
all other significant information technology infrastructure components and embedded chips either have been modified or  if not year compliant  have been retired 
our eastern region our eastern region information technology department has been focused on a business recovery strategy to normalize operations  which were disrupted as a result of the conversion to the stow mills system in our atlanta and dayville facilities 
a new management team has been appointed to continue the recovery process and address year compliance 
the primary business operation systems in the eastern region are bip utilized by all four eastern region warehouses to accept customer orders  place purchase orders with our vendors and maintain inventory controls 
bako warehouse management system used in chesterfield and new oxford 
cwms warehouse management system used in dayville and atlanta 
down to earth accounting software 
bip  bako and cwms are currently being re evaluated for year compliance 
many critical components  including all hardware and network equipment  have been successfully tested 
the remaining components are undergoing testing for compliance 
we may not achieve comprehensive testing and remediation for the systems prior to january however  substantially all the systems are currently handling dates beyond january  we have assembled a team of it professionals both from within and outside the company who are familiar with our systems in an effort to successfully resolve any year issues in a timely manner if testing and remediation are not completed by year end 
if we are unable to resolve these issues by january   we expect to manually perform certain functions performed by the affected systems until the issues are resolved 
this could adversely affect our ability to fill and process customer orders which could result in a reduction in our revenues and net income 
in addition  any additional costs incurred to address these problems could adversely impact our operating earnings and net income 
the down to earth accounting software is developed and supported by an outside vendor 
the vendor has represented to us that the software has been tested and is year compliant 
the system has successfully accepted dates beyond january  our edi software  which enables us to communicate electronically with some of our customers  including receiving orders  is not compliant and must be upgraded to become year compliant 
we are working with our edi vendor  and expect to complete the upgrade before year end 
if this system is not upgraded  we expect to process these orders manually 
microprocessors and other electronic devices used in the eastern region have been tested and are year compliant 
the telephone systems in atlanta and new oxford are year compliant 
the telephone systems in dayville and chesterfield are not compliant and are scheduled to be replaced in november retail stores all but one of our cash registers are year compliant 
we plan to replace the last register by november we believe all other critical information technology infrastructure and embedded chips are year compliant 
albert s organics  inc and hershey import co  inc 
our hershey business has turned back its system clock to simulate to avoid year issues 
we have simulated year system clock dates for the albert s systems and made the code changes required to make these systems year compliant 
our suppliers and customers we have sent written requests for year information to substantially all suppliers 
we are currently reviewing the responses received and have sent second requests to the top suppliers making up at least of our purchases 
we have also compiled a database of all customers regarding their year status and plans for remediation and have sent both initial and follow up information requests 
substantially all responses received from both suppliers and customers indicate they are year compliant or will be by january  expenditures we are in the process of updating our systems for business functionality reasons and have adopted a systems strategy of staying current with state of the art systems technology 
we are also in the process of integrating acquisitions to achieve customer service and operating efficiency improvements  which require common state of the art systems technology 
accordingly  all business systems changes would be performed regardless of the year issue both from a timing and cost perspective 
we have significantly increased our information technology expenditures to execute our systems strategy that includes any immaterial incremental amounts to achieve year compliance 
we therefore believe that we will have spent an incremental amount of less than million on year remediation over what we would have spent to execute our going forward systems strategy 
we spent on information technology systems and support approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
potential risks the dates on which we believe we will be year compliant are based on our plans for work to be performed and best estimates which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results may differ materially from those anticipated 
if we are unsuccessful in completing remediation of non compliant systems  correcting embedded chips or if customers or suppliers cannot rectify their year issues  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have not yet established a contingency plan in the event of non compliance by any parties 
we are developing regional contingency plans for any critical business applications and expect to have such plans completed by the end of november certain factors that may affect future results if any of the events described below actually occur  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in  or incorporated by reference into  this form k 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to integrate our acquisitions and mergers a significant portion of our historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of or mergers with other distributors of natural products 
united natural merged with stow mills in october the successful and timely integration of this merger is critical to our future operating and financial performance 
the integration will require  among other things o the integration of computer systems onto a single systems platform  o the optimization of delivery routes  o coordination of administrative  distribution and finance functions  and o the integration of personnel 
the integration process has and could continue to divert the attention of management  and any further difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the process of combining the companies has and could continue to cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the respective businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations 
there can be no assurance that united natural will retain key employees of stow mills or that we will realize any of the other anticipated benefits of the stow mills merger 
we announced plans during fiscal to close our chesterfield  new hampshire distribution center and to consolidate its operations with our dayville  connecticut and new oxford  pennsylvania facilities 
we began transferring sales operations from the chesterfield facility to our dayville facility during june of and the process is still ongoing 
there continue to be numerous risks involved with this consolidation of operations including  among other things o we have had and may continue to have difficulty retaining drivers currently employed at our chesterfield facility or hiring a sufficient number of new drivers at our dayville and new oxford facilities to handle the increased sales volume at those facilities  o we have had and may continue to have difficulty retaining warehouse employees at our chesterfield facility or hiring a sufficient number of new warehouse employees at our dayville and new oxford facilities to handle the increased sales volume at those facilities  o we have lost and may continue to lose business  o our operating costs have increased and may continue to increase because of the expenses involved in closing the chesterfield facility and consolidating its operations into the operations in place at the dayville and new oxford facilities  o our dayville and new oxford facilities have had and may continue to have difficulty accommodating the increased sales volume  and o construction delays in the expansion of the new oxford facility could delay the realization of savings 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may have difficulty in managing our growth the growth in the size of our business and operations has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management 
our future growth is limited in part by the size and location of our distribution centers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets to facilitate growth 
in addition  our growth strategy to expand our market presence includes possible additional acquisitions 
to the extent our future growth includes acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate and integrate such potential acquisitions or expand into new markets 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
there can be no assurance that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations 
our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources we operate in highly competitive markets  and our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices 
our competition comes from a variety of sources  including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors 
there can be no assurance that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with us or that new competitors will not enter the market 
these distributors may have been in business longer than us  may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and may be better established in their markets 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than united natural to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of our customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
we depend heavily on our principal customers our ability to maintain close  mutually beneficial relationships with our top two customers  whole foods market  inc and wild oats markets  inc  is important to the ongoing growth and profitability of our business 
whole foods market  inc and wild oats markets  inc 
accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our net sales during the fiscal year ended july  as a result of this concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from either of these customers  including from increased distribution to their own facilities  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we sell products under purchase orders  and we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
no assurance can be given that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base 
our profit margins may decrease due to consolidation in the grocery industry the grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume with relatively low profit margins 
the continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the emergence of super natural chains may reduce our profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts 
our industry is sensitive to economic downturns the grocery industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  and the demand for our products may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
in addition  our operating results are particularly sensitive to  and may be materially adversely affected by o difficulties with the collectibility of accounts receivable  o difficulties with inventory control  o competitive pricing pressures  and o unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on a number of key executives management of our business is substantially dependent on the services of norman a 
cloutier  chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and other key management employees 
loss of the services of such officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to o changes in our operating expenses  o management s ability to execute our business and growth strategies  o personnel changes  o demand for natural products  o supply shortages  o general economic conditions  o changes in customer preferences and demands for natural products  including levels of enthusiasm for health  fitness and environmental issues  o fluctuation of natural product prices due to competitive pressures  o lack of an adequate supply of high quality agricultural products due to poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  o volatility in prices of high quality agricultural products resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  and o future acquisitions  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation our business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels and our products and distribution operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
in particular o our products are subject to inspection by the us food and drug administration  o our warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the us department of agriculture and state health authorities  and o our trucking operations are regulated by the us department of transportation and the us federal highway administration 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our officers and directors and the employee stock ownership trust have significant voting power 
as of january   our executive officers and directors  and their affiliates  and the united natural foods employee stock ownership trust beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately of united natural s common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders  if acting together  would have the ability to elect our directors and may have the ability to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how other stockholders may vote 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of united natural 
union organizing activities could cause labor relations difficulties as of may   approximately employees  representing approximately of our approximately  employees  were union members 
we have in the past been the focus of union organizing efforts 
as we increase our employee base and broaden our distribution operations to new geographic markets  our increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union organizing efforts 
although we have not experienced a work stoppage to date  if additional employees were to unionize  we could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
access to capital and the cost of that capital in order to maintain our profit margins  we rely on strategic investment buying initiatives  such as discounted bulk purchases  which require spending significant amounts of working capital 
in the event that capital market turmoil significantly increased our cost of capital or the ability to borrow funds or raise equity capital  we could suffer reduced profit margins and be unable to grow our business organically or through acquisitions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our systems may not all be year compliant by january  as discussed above  our systems may not all be year compliant by january  this could result in being unable to accept  process and invoice orders which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
