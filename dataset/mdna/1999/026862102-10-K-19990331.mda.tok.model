this restriction or potential loss of the availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the general partner and the partnership  however  criimi mae has not historically represented a significant source of capital for the general partner or the partnership

part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year the year issue is a computer programming issue that may affect many electronic processing systems 
until relatively recently  in order to minimize the length of data fields  most date sensitive programs eliminated the first two digits of the year 
this issue could affect information technology it systems and date sensitive embedded technology that controls certain systems such as telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
leaving them unable to properly recognize or distinguish dates in the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
this treatment could result in significant miscalculations when processing critical date sensitive information relating to dates after december  the general partner is currently in the process of assessing and testing year compliance of its it systems  which include software systems to administer and manage mortgage assets and for internal accounting purposes 
a majority of the it systems used by the partnership is licensed from third parties 
these third parties have either provided upgrades to existing systems or have indicated that their systems are year compliant 
the general partner has applied upgrades and has completed a substantial amount of compliance testing as of march  there can be no assurance  however  that the partnership s it systems will be year compliant by december  the year issue may also affect the general partner s date sensitive embedded technology  which controls systems such as the telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
the general partner does not believe that the cost to modify or replace such technology to make it year compliant will be material 
the failure of any such systems to be year compliant could be material to the partnership 
the potential impact of the year issue depends not only on the corrective measures the general partner has undertaken and will undertake  but also on the ways in which the year issue is addressed by third parties with whom the partnership directly interfaces or whose financial condition or operations are important to the partnership 
the partnership has initiated communications with third parties with which it directly interfaces to evaluate the risk of their failure to be year compliant and the extent to which the partnership may be vulnerable to such failure 
there can be no assurance that the systems of these third parties will be year compliant by december  the failure of these third parties to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the partnership 
the partnership believes that its greatest risk with respect to the year issue relates to failures by third parties to be year compliant 
in addition to risks posed by third parties with which the partnership interfaces directly  risks are created by third parties providing services to large segments of society 
the failure of third parties to be year compliant could  among other things  cause disruptions in the capital and real estate markets and borrower defaults on real estate loans and mortgage backed securities as well as the pools of mortgage loans underlying such securities 
the partnership believes that its greatest exposure to the year issue involves the loan servicing operations of an affiliate of the partnership 
cmslp currently services approximately of the total mortgage investments in the aim funds 
cmslp has applied a vendor upgrade and has substantially completed compliance testing on the upgrade 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued currently the partnership estimates the cost of system upgrades related to year issues to be immaterial 
although the general partner has substantially completed its compliance testing and remediation  it is also in the process of developing contingency plans for the risks of the failure of the partnership or third parties to be year compliant 
the general partner intends to complete contingency plans for the year issue by may  due to the inability to predict all of the potential problems that may arise from the year issue  there can be no assurance that all contingencies will be adequately addressed by such plans

part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued investment in fha insured certificates listed below is the partnership s aggregate investment in fha insured certificates as of december  and december  number of mortgages amortized cost   face value   fair value   all of the fha insured certificates were current with respect to the payment of principal and interest as of march  results of operations versus net earnings increased for as compared to primarily due to an increase in gains on mortgage dispositions 
in  gains were realized on the prepayment of the mortgage on waters edge apartments and the assignment of the mortgage on portervillage i apartments  as discussed below 
no mortgages were disposed of or modified during the increase in net earnings was partially offset by a decrease in mortgage investment income  caused by the reduction in the mortgage base  as discussed previously 
versus net earnings increased for as compared to primarily due to the loss incurred in on the mortgage modification of creekside village 
no mortgages were disposed of or modified during liquidity and capital resources the partnership s operating cash receipts derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  are the partnership s principal sources of cash flows  and were sufficient for the years ended december   and to meet operating requirements 
the partnership anticipates its cash flows to be sufficient to meet operating requirements for the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions  if any  and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages after paying all expenses of the partnership 
although insured mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each period due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payment receipts are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base resulting from monthly mortgage payments received or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and changes in the partnership s operating expenses 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued since the partnership is obligated to distribute the proceeds of mortgage prepayments  sales and insurance of insured mortgages as defined in the partnership agreement to its unitholders  the size of the partnership s portfolio will continue to decrease 
the magnitude of the decrease will depend upon the size of the insured mortgages which are prepaid  sold or assigned for insurance proceeds 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to an increase in due from affiliate  as discussed previously  and a reduction in net earnings excluding gains from mortgage dispositions in net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to due to proceeds received from the prepayment and assignment of two mortgages in net cash used in financing activities increased for as compared to primarily due to larger distributions to unitholders in related to the prepayment of one mortgage 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to primarily due to an increase in receivables and other assets due to the delinquent mortgage on portervillage i apartments  which was assigned to hud in may net cash provided by investing activities decreased slightly for as compared to primarily due to a reduction in the receipt of mortgage principal from scheduled payments as a result of the normal amortization of the mortgage base
