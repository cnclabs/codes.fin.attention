outlook issues and uncertainties the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions 
product introductions are generally characterized by increased functionality and better quality  sometimes at reduced prices 
the introduction of products embodying new technology may render existing products obsolete and unmarketable or marketable at substantially reduced prices 
the company s ability to successfully develop and introduce on a timely basis new and enhanced products that embody new technology  and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market will be a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and to remain competitive 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the industry  the company s business and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
the company competes with companies which have substantially greater resources and a larger number of products  as well as with small specialized companies 
through relationships with technology partners and original equipment manufacturer oem suppliers  the company has positioned itself to provide end to end solutions to its customers 
competition in the market for the company s mpeg broadcast television electronics products  including digital video equipment  is driven by timeliness  performance  and price 
the company s broadcast digital video products in production are competitively priced  with unique  desirable features 
the compel network control system meets these needs by providing regionalization of receiver control and spot advertisement 
due to the large number of potential end users  both small and large competitors continue to emerge 
the company believes it has positioned itself to capitalize on the market trends in this business through careful development of its product and market strategies  which have proven successful in increasing revenues from this sector 
in the cable television market the company believes that the competitive position for many of its products is strong 
however  the unity product family competes with significant and established firms 
other products for cable television include proprietary cueing and network control devices 
competition for radio network products  including the company s digital audio products  is very aggressive and pricing is very competitive 
the company believes that its continued success in all of its markets will depend on aggressive marketing and product development 
the demand for digital products is being driven by the high cost of satellite capacity and increasing demand for video and multi media content 
satellite capacity is scarce due to pressures on both the supply and demand side of the market 
on the supply side  satellites are extremely expensive to launch  build  and maintain 
the useful life of a satellite is limited by the amount of positioning fuel that can be carried 
also  the placement of satellites is regulated by the federal communications commission fcc and therefore the number of satellites within range of any given location is limited 
on the demand side  the cost of receive hardware is being steadily reduced through advancing technology 
the reduction in the cost of network hardware increases the economic feasibility of a greater number of networks 
this is evidenced by the trend in both television and radio towards narrow casting to well defined market segments as opposed to broadcasting to the general population 
digital compression technology allows a four to ten fold  or more  increase in the throughput of a satellite channel 
for the network  this compression represents an opportunity to reduce the cost of satellite use 
for the satellite operator it represents an opportunity to increase the revenues generated by an expensive asset 
the digital conversion of major networks is expected to continue  but it remains difficult to predict the precise timing and number of customers converting to digital 
management believes the market as a whole has considerable built up demand for digital technology 
although no assurances can be given  the company expects to directly benefit from this increase in demand 
there may be fluctuations in the company s revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter due to several factors  including the timing of significant orders from customers and the timing of new product introductions by the company 
the company has invested a significant amount of financial resources to acquire certain raw materials  to incur direct labor and to contract to have specific outplant procedures performed on inventory in process 
the company purchased this inventory based upon previously known backlog and anticipated future sales given existing knowledge of the marketplace 
the company s inventory reserve of  at september   is to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess  or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand  and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices 
no estimate can be made of a range of amounts of loss from obsolescence that might occur should the company s sales efforts not be successful 
the company s gross margin percentage is subject to variations based on the product mix sold in any period and on sales volumes 
start up costs associated with new product introductions could adversely impact costs and future margins 
certain raw materials  video sub components  and licensed video processing technologies used in existing and future products are currently available from single or limited sources 
although the company believes that all single source components currently are available in adequate quantities  there can be no assurance that shortages or unanticipated delivery interruptions will not develop in the future 
any disruption or termination of supply of certain single source components or technologies could have an adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has made significant investments in capitalized software principally related to the digital audio and video products 
at september  capitalized software costs were  these costs are amortized based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes  and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives 
the industry in which the company operates is subject to rapid technological advances and frequent product introductions 
the company expects to remain committed to research and development expenditures as required to effectively compete and maintain pace with the rapid technological changes in the communications industry and to support innovative engineering and design in its future products 
the company had retained earnings of  at september  the company is very focused on controlling both direct and indirect manufacturing costs and other operating expenses 
these costs will be adjusted as necessary if the revenues of the company do not increase as planned 
management believes that digital compression technology may be profitably employed to create increased demand for its satellite receiving equipment if those products are manufactured in a high volume standardized production environment 
year as is the case with other companies utilizing computers in their operations  the company has been faced with the task of addressing the year issue 
the year issue arises from the widespread use of computer programs that rely on two digit codes to perform computations or decision making functions 
the company has done a comprehensive review of its computer programs to identify systems which would be affected by the year issue 
state of readiness management of the company has reviewed the company s current information systems and has found them to be year compliant 
however  the company is currently in the process of replacing older information systems with new systems that offer easier access to more data and are certified to be able to handle the year transition 
conversions to the new systems are expected to be completed prior to december  management of the company has reviewed and tested the company s phone  voice mail  e mail  and security systems and all are believed to be year compliant 
utility companies have been contacted and have reported to the company that only minor problems have been noted in regards to their billing software as a result of their year testing completed to date 
although there can be no guarantee  no major interruption in service is anticipated 
the company has requested and received year compliance statements from major vendors 
there are no indications that major vendors will not be year compliant 
however  there can be no absolute assurances in this regard and their failure to be compliant remains a possibility 
if vendors are not year compliant  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find suitable alternate suppliers and contract with them on reasonable terms  or at all  and such inability could have a material and adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has and is expected to continue to have material sales to a relatively small number of customers 
although the company is not aware of any specific year issues in regards to these customers  a loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
all test equipment used in engineering  service  and manufacturing departments has been reviewed and all are year compliant 
all of the company s products have been reviewed for year compliance 
all are compliant with the exception of certain minor problems in the schedule and repetitive scheduler programs of an older version of uplink software 
all customers affected by this have been offered a migration path to newer software which is year compliant 
costs to address the year issues management of the company believes that although the evaluation of internal systems is still in process  the impact of the year transition on the company s internal systems has not and should not result in material costs to the company or have a material adverse impact on future results 
risks of the year issues the main risk to the company with respect to year is the failure of major vendors and service providers to be year compliant 
failure on their part could result in delays in obtaining parts  increased cost of parts  and overall inability to design and manufacture products in the event of a shutdown of major utility providers 
major vendors and service providers have reported to the company that they believe they will be year compliant 
the company cannot estimate the financial impact of any failure to be year compliant by such third party vendors and service providers  although such failure could have a material and adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
this risk is particularly acute with respect to non us third parties  as it is widely reported that many non us businesses and governments are not addressing their year issues on a timely basis 
contingency plans the company does not have a contingency plan for year compliance because it does not anticipate that it will fail to be year compliant  particularly in relation to those systems  software programs  and hardware that are under its control 
however  there can be no assurances that all measures being taken to avoid year problems will be effective and as such  unforeseen issues could arise that could lead to a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its revolving line of credit and cash equivalents 
the interest rate on certain advances under the line of credit and term loan facility fluctuates with the bank s prime rate 
there were no borrowings outstanding at september  subject to variable interest rate fluctuations 
the company s cash equivalents consists of a repurchase agreement and a bank certificate of deposit 
the cash equivalents have maturities of less than three months and therefore are subject to minimal market risk 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments 
all sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars
