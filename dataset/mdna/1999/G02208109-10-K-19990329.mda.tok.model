the increasingly competitive workers compensation market in which the majority of the company s programs compete has resulted in a change in the company s fee arrangements with reinsurers which is expected to negatively impact earnings in the company is trying to minimize the effect of these changes in fee structure but it is expected that while the workers compensation market remains so competitive  the company s fees will continue to be under pressure

policy issuance fees increased to million in which represents a million or increase from million in which represented a million or increase from million in market conditions in the workers compensation insurance market in which realm national writes the majority of its business grew increasingly competetive during and this trend has continued into while these competitive market conditions continue they are likely to restrict realm national s ability to continue its rate of expansion in its workers compensation book of business during realm national is continuing to seek to expand its volume of business in other lines of insurance  where market conditions are less competetive 
segment profit of million in represented an increase of million or from segment profit of million in which was in turn a million or increase from segment profit of million in reinsurance the company s reinsurance segment comprising circl experienced limited growth in revenues in and revenues of million in represented an increase of million or from revenues of million in which was in turn a million or increase from revenues of million in net premiums earned are the largest component of revenues in circl

the adverse development during reflects primarily an increase in claims frequency on one particular program that covers bodily injury and property risks in the construction industry 
this program was not renewed by circl in at december   the company was in dispute with certain of its reinsurers in respect of amounts due under retrocession coverages 
the company has provided million against reinsurance contracts with total recoveries of million of which million has been reported to date 
the provision represents management s best estimates at this time of a possible shortfall in recoveries 
this provision is included in the balance sheet as a component of paid losses recoverable from reinsurers 
the provision is necessarily an estimate and amounts not collectible from reinsurers may ultimately be significantly greater or lesser than the provision established 
it is reasonably possible that management will revise this estimate significantly in the near term 
any subsequent differences arising will be recorded in the period in which they occur 
during the course of the year  the company s management evaluated circl s underwriting results and  as a result of unfavorable results  reduced circl s underwriting 
management decided in early to cease underwriting any new programs in circl and a number of existing contracts were not renewed for the year 
those renewed will be allowed to run until they expire at december  because some contracts were not renewed by circl during  revenues should decrease accordingly

shareholders equity increased by million  to million  at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the following i million of net proceeds from the initial public offering during the year  ii a reclassification of ordinary shares subject to redemption of million since these shares are no longer redeemable after consummation of the initial public offering  and iii net income of million earned during total assets increased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december   principally as a result of increased business activity and a significant increase in client insurance balances outstanding

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments and related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
this disclosure is located within note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs or non information systems that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or in miscalculations 
in  the company appointed individuals in each of the company s geographic regions to review and assess the company s state of readiness and its ability to process transactions in the year these individuals and the overall committee that they are a part of are providing guidance to the operating and support departments  and have and will continue to monitor the progress of efforts made to address the year issue 
the company is currently implementing its plan and preparing its various computer systems and selected applications for the year this process involves taking inventory  testing  evaluating and adjusting all known date sensitive systems and equipment for year compliance 
in addition  the company is reviewing its essential non information technology systems for year compliance 
the company has also consulted with various third parties  including  but not limited to  outside consultants  outside service providers and infrastructure providers to develop approaches to the year issue  to gain insight to problems and to provide additional perspective on solutions 
the company expects that compliance work with respect to the internal systems will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of in  all systems critical to the company s core businesses will be retested 
the individuals in each geographic region report at least quarterly to the overall committee that they are a part of and update that committee on their respective region s progress 
the latest update is that each geographic region is proceeding on schedule as planned 
in the us and bermuda  the company s internal computer system and software is relatively modern and few costs have been or are expected to be incurred to bring those systems into compliance 
in the uk  the company s internal systems and software were not as modern and the majority of the company s year costs in upgrading the company s systems and software have been incurred in that region 
because of the year issue  one large system in the uk was replaced in late the company continues to assess its external relationships with third parties 
the company is in the process of communicating with its significant vendors and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
where deemed necessary by the company  this process involves onsite review of the third party s procedures and plans for year compliance 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties  such as utility companies  regulatory bodies  government entities  insurance related companies or insurance carriers on which the company s operations rely  will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
however  management believes that ongoing communication with and assessment of third parties will minimize these risks 
the company s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may also have an underwriting exposure to the year phenomenon 
although the subsidiaries have not received any claims of coverage from insureds based on losses resulting from year issues  there can be no assurance that insureds will be free from losses of this type or that these subsidiaries will be free from claims made under their policies 
the total estimated cost of compliance is million 
approximately million of the cost is related to reprogramming or replacement of software  and approximately million is related to acquisition of hardware 
costs related to non information technology are expected to be immaterial 
approximately million of the million cost of compliance has been incurred as of the end of december  all of these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
total costs have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial results 
based on the review of the state of readiness of the company and its risks  the company currently anticipates minimal business disruption will occur as a result of year issues 
nonetheless  the year issue represents a risk that cannot be assessed with precision nor controlled with certainty 
possible consequences of disruptions that could occur given non compliance include  but are not limited to  loss of communication links with subsidiaries and insurance carriers  loss of electric power  inability to process transactions or inability to engage in similar normal business activities 
furthermore  failure of significant third parties with which the company conducts business  including insurance carriers  to meet year compliance could have a materially detrimental effect on the company 
to date  the company has not established a contingency plan for possible year issues 
where needed  the company will establish contingency plans based on actual testing experience with its systems and assessment of outside risks 
inflation the company does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
the potential adverse impacts of inflation include a a decline in the market value of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio  b an increase in the ultimate cost of settling claims which remain unresolved for a significant period of time  and c an increase in the company s operating expenses 
however  the company generally holds its fixed maturity investments to maturity and currently believes that an acceptable amount is included in the yield to compensate the company for the risk of inflation 
any increase in the cost of settling claims will be offset by increases in investment income earned and  generally  an increase in operating expenses resulting from inflation should be matched by similar increases in investment income earned on the company s general surplus funds 
item a market risk the company s investment portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments  equity securities  and short term investments 
the company s exposure to market risk is primarily limited to changing interest rates  primarily in the united states  as all fixed maturity investments are denominated in us dollars 
the fair value of the fixed maturity investments as at december  was million 
a change in interest rates will affect the fair value of the company s investments and will lead to fluctuations in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage market risk in its portfolio 
the table below expressed in millions of us dollars presents the par value amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s us dollar denominated investment portfolio 
total investments fixed maturity weighted average interest rate given the limited value of balances and transactions in foreign currencies  the company s exposure to foreign currency movements is considered to be insignificant
