item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview veeco is a leader in the design  manufacture  marketing and servicing of a broad line of precision metrology and process equipment used to measure  test and manufacture microelectronic products for the data storage and semiconductor industries 
precision metrology equipment is primarily used to measure critical dimensions on thin film magnetic heads tfmhs and semiconductor devices 
process equipment is primarily used to etch and deposit materials in the manufacture of tfmhs 
during the last several years  veeco has increasingly emphasized its metrology product line  which accounted for million or of its net sales for the year ended december  this emphasis was demonstrated by the mergers with wyko in july and digital in may these mergers resulted in a broadening of the metrology product line by adding the optical interferometry products manufactured by wyko and atomic force scanning probe microscopes manufactured by digital to the stylus profiler products manufactured by veeco 
veeco s net sales for included million attributable to sales of wyko and digital products 
veeco s consolidated financial condition and results of operations have been retroactively restated to reflect veeco s mergers with wyko and digital  which have been accounted for as poolings of interests 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relationship in percentages of selected items of veeco s consolidated statements of income to its total net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative other net 
merger and reorganization expenses write off of purchased in process technology total operating expenses operating income interest expense income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income years ended december  and net sales were million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million or  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease in sales reflects a decrease in process equipment sales partially offset by an increase in metrology sales 
sales in the us  europe  japan and asia pacific  respectively  accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net sales for the year ended december  sales in the us decreased approximately  while international sales included a increase in europe  a increase in japan and a decrease in asia pacific from the comparable period 
the decrease in us sales principally reflects reduced process equipment sales to data storage customers 
the increase in sales in europe and in japan principally reflects increased process equipment sales to data storage customers along with increased metrology sales for data storage and semiconductor applications 
the decrease in sales in asia pacific principally reflects a decrease in sales of all product lines resulting from the economic downturn in that region 
the company believes that there will continue to be quarter to quarter variations in the geographic concentration of sales 
metrology sales of million for the year ended december  increased by million or over the comparable period principally reflecting increased purchases of metrology products for in line inspection of critical steps in data storage applications 
process equipment sales of million for the year ended december   decreased by million or from the comparable period  as sales of ion beam etch products declined  partially offset by increased sales of new deposition products associated with the transition to magnetoresistive mr and giant magnetoresistive gmr thin film magnetic heads tfmhs 
ion beam etch sales continue to be negatively affected by excess capacity in the data storage industry 
industrial measurement sales for the year ended december   of million increased over the comparable period 
veeco received million of orders for the year ended december   representing a increase from million of orders in the comparable period 
metrology orders increased to million reflecting increased purchases of in line metrology products for production applications such as ptr pole tip recession measurements for new mr and gmr thin film magnetic heads 
process equipment orders decreased to million as a result of a reduction in orders of ion beam etch products  reflecting weak data storage market conditions  including industry wide overcapacity 
industrial measurement orders decreased to million as a result of a reduction in orders of industrial leak detection equipment 
the book to bill ratio for the year ended december  was to gross profit for the year ended december  of million represents a decrease of million from the comparable period 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for from for  principally due to a decrease in gross margin for the process equipment product line 
this decline resulted from lower sales volume  increased field support  warranty  facility and information system costs and the increase in sales of new deposition products with lower initial gross margins than established ion beam etch products 
the metrology product line experienced higher field service and warranty costs as it expanded sales of production related inspection tools to data storage customers at a variety of international locations 
research and development expense for the year ended december  of million increased by million or over the comparable period of  as the company continues to invest in new product development in each of its product lines with particular emphasis on in line inspection tools in the metrology product line and deposition tools for its process equipment line 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  remained relatively flat when compared to as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  for the year ended december   the company recorded a million pre tax charge for merger and reorganization expenses principally related to the merger with digital during such period 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a million write off for the fair values of acquired in process engineering and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and have no future alternative uses and a million charge related to the merger with wyko 
income taxes for the year ended december  amounted to million or of income before income taxes as compared to million or of income before income taxes for the same period of these effective tax rates reflect digital s s corporation status for five months in through the merger date compared to a full year in as an s corporation  digital was not subject to federal income taxes at the corporation level 
years ended december  and net sales were million for the year ended december  representing an increase of approximately million or  when compared to the year ended december  the increase reflects growth in veeco s process equipment and metrology product lines 
sales in the us increased approximately  while international sales included a increase in asia pacific  a increase in europe and a decrease in japan 
sales of metrology products increased by to approximately million in compared to principally as a result of increased sales of wyko optical interferometers  dektak stylus profilers and scatterometers  atomic force microscopes and digital spm systems 
sales of wyko optical interferometers increased by  reflecting increased acceptance by the semiconductor industry of non contact optical measurement for advanced packaging 
sales of dektak stylus profilers and scatterometers increased by reflecting acceptance of new product introductions in the data storage and semiconductor industries 
atomic force microscope sales increased reflecting increased demand for advanced semiconductor applications 
nano scope dimension spm systems sales increased by approximately  partially offset by a decrease in sales of digital s other product groups 
sales of process equipment increased by to approximately million in compared to  driven principally by increased demand from the data storage industry for equipment used in the production of mr and gmr heads for high density hard drives 
of this increase  approximately was due to growth in volume  with the balance of the increase due to a shift in customer demand to multi process modules with increased automation which resulted in an approximately higher average selling price of a system 
sales of industrial measurement products were approximately million in  which remained relatively flat when compared to veeco received approximately million of orders in compared to approximately million in  reflecting both the increased demand for high density hard drives and the continued industry transition to the next generation mr thin film magnetic heads as well as increased semiconductor industry investment in advanced products 
the book to bill ratio was to for the year ended december  gross profit increased to approximately million  or of net sales for  compared to million or of net sales for this decrease in gross margin is principally attributable to a decrease in gross margin in digital s scanning probe atomic force microscopes from in to in research and development expense increased by approximately million to approximately million  or of net sales in compared to approximately million or of sales in  due to increased r d investment in process equipment and metrology 
increased r d investment was made in process equipment in physical vapor deposition pvd and in ion beam deposition 
in metrology  increased investments were made in wyko optical interferometer products for both data storage and semiconductor market products along with investments in dektak stylus profilers for the semiconductor  data storage and flat panel display markets and investments in digital products for integrated circuit and data storage applications 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million to of net sales in from for selling expense increased million  principally due to higher sales commissions resulting from higher sales volume  increased compensation and travel expense as a result of additional sales and service personnel required to support veeco s growth and an increase in advertising and marketing to support new products 
operating expenses in include merger costs incurred in connection with the merger with wyko corporation of approximately million  consisting of investment banking  legal and other transaction costs 
operating expenses in also include the effect of a million charge representing the write off of the fair values of in process engineering and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and have no future alternative uses 
income taxes amounted to million or of income before income taxes for as compared to million or of income before income taxes for the principal reason for the low effective tax rate when compared to the statutory income tax rate is due to digital s s corporation status 
as an s corporation  digital was not subject to federal income taxes at the corporation level 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations totaled million in compared to million in and million in cash provided by operations in resulted from i net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  and certain merger and reorganization charges of million plus ii increases of accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and other net operating assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
these items were partially offset by an increase in inventories and a provision for deferred income taxes of million and million  respectively  as well as a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the increase in inventories is attributable to an increase in inventory at the company s domestic manufacturing and international sales locations to support new product introductions 
cash from operations in resulted from i net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and the write off of purchased in process technology of million plus ii increases of accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and other net operating assets and liabilities of million  million and 
million  respectively 
these items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories and a provision for deferred income taxes of million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued expenses are attributable to the increased sales volume 
cash from operations in resulted from i net income plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million plus ii increases of accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and other net operating assets and liabilities of million  million and million  respectively 
these items were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income taxes of million  million and million  respectively 
the increases in accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued expenses are attributable to the increased sales volume 
net cash used in investing activities in totaled million compared to million in and million in veeco made capital expenditures of million in  compared to million in the comparable period 
capital expenditures in were principally for engineering and application lab equipment 
cash used for investing activities in primarily related to the pvd acquisition million and capital expenditures million 
capital expenditures in included the purchase of a  square foot building in california for million for the company s metrology business  as well as for manufacturing facilities  laboratory and test equipment and business system upgrades 
cash used in investing activities in was for capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in compared to million in and a use of cash of million in the generation of cash in resulted from proceeds from stock issuances partially offset by distributions to former digital shareholders of million 
the generation of cash in resulted from proceeds from the sale of common stock and proceeds from long term debt offset by distributions to former digital shareholders of million 
cash used in principally resulted from distributions of million to former digital shareholders 
on february   the company completed a public offering  pursuant to which  shares of common stock  par value 
per share  were issued and sold for per share  less underwriting discounts and commissions of per share 
the company expects to use the net proceeds of the offering approximately million for capital expenditures including clean manufacturing areas and expanded customer application laboratories and for working capital and general corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions 
the company has an unsecured million credit facility the credit facility which may be used for working capital  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility bears interest at the prime rate of the lending banks  but is adjustable to a maximum rate of above the prime rate in the event the company s ratio of debt to cash flow exceeds a defined ratio 
a libor based interest rate option is also provided 
as of december  there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the company will be required to repay promissory notes owed to former stockholders of digital in the aggregate principal amount of  when they become due in march the notes bear interest at an annual rate of the company believes that existing cash balances together with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s projected working capital and other cash flow requirements through year the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware or other equipment that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on recent assessments  the company has determined that it needs to modify or replace portions of its business systems software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications or replacements of its business systems existing software and certain hardware  the company s computer programs should be able to continue to operate effectively after december  however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
furthermore  in addition to its own systems  the company relies directly and indirectly on external systems of its customers  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  utilities providers and governmental agencies collectively  third parties 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to resolve the year issue following a phased approach which is comprised of inventory and assessment  planning and renovation  testing and implementation 
the following describes the company s efforts to identify and address its and applicable third party year issues with respect to a the company s information technology it and non it systems  including facilities and infrastructure  b the company s products and c the company s suppliers a the company s it and non it systems including facilities and infrastructure in  the company completed the installation of a new business system for its process equipment and industrial product lines which has been certified by the vendor as year compliant 
the company recently completed its assessment and testing of its business systems for its metrology business lines 
based upon such assessment and testing  along with installing vendor upgrades and relying upon compliance statements received from its software and hardware vendors  the company believes its metrology business systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  furthermore  the company is in the process of installing a new business system for its sales and service offices in europe that the vendor has certified is year compliant 
the company recently completed its inventory and assessment of its desktop systems and laptops 
the company currently uses standard off the shelf vendor supplied software on its desktop systems and laptops 
based upon this assessment  the company is not aware of any business critical remediation that is required and believes that its business critical desktop systems and laptops will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company is in the process of assessing its year risk with respect to telephone and communications systems  utility systems and building security systems 
formal inquiries were sent to third parties in december inquiring as to such third parties year readiness 
the company anticipates completing its assessment before june  b the company s products the company has recently completed its inventory and assessment of its products year readiness utilizing testing guidelines prepared by sematech  a consortium of suppliers to worldwide semiconductor manufacturers 
the company plans to comply with sematech s guidelines for year compliance for its metrology and process equipment lines 
the company s new products are designed to be year ready  however  some of the company s older products will require upgrades for year readiness 
the company intends to provide upgrades for certain of such products  some of which will be provided to customers without charge 
notwithstanding such efforts  any failure of the company s products to perform  including system malfunctions due to the onset of year  could result in claims against the company which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
in such event  the company s customers could choose to convert to other year ready products in order to avoid such malfunctions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
c the company s suppliers the company is in the process of assessing its significant suppliers and subcontractors regarding the status of their year readiness 
to date  the company is not aware of any year issue that would materially impact the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that suppliers or subcontractors will be year ready 
the inability of suppliers or subcontractors to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the company is unable to determine the effect of non compliance by suppliers or subcontractors 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  to  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
to date  the company has incurred approximately  of which  has been expensed and  has been capitalized  related to all phases of the year project 
of the total remaining project costs  approximately  to  is attributable to the purchase of new software and operating equipment which will be capitalized 
the remaining  to  relates to repair of hardware and software and external consultant costs and will be expensed as incurred 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in the event the company does not successfully complete any additional phases  the company s ability to do business with its suppliers and customers may be disrupted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the systems of third parties with which the company interacts will not suffer from year problems  or that such problems would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in particular  year problems that have been or may in the future be identified with respect to the it and non it systems of third parties having widespread national and international interactions with persons and entities generally for example  certain it and non it systems of governmental agencies  utilities and information and financial networks could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not currently have any contingency plans and has not yet determined its most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to the year issue 
the company currently is in the process of reviewing its year compliance plans to determine what contingency plans  if any  are appropriate 
there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent the occurrence of year problems  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
risk factors that may impact future results certain information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements which are forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
the following risk factors should be considered by shareholders of and by potential investors in the company 
dependence on microelectronics industry  cyclicality of data storage and semiconductor industries 
veeco s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of data storage and semiconductor manufacturers which accounted for the following percentages of the company s net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  data storage semiconductor the data storage and semiconductor industries have been characterized by cyclicality 
these industries have experienced significant economic downturns at various times in the last decade  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity 
recently  the data storage and semiconductor industries have experienced inventory oversupply and poor operating results and  as a result  veeco s sales to data storage and semiconductor customers were weaker in than in fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
veeco s quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect this trend to continue 
factors which affect quarterly results include specific economic conditions in the data storage and semiconductor industries the timing of significant orders shipment delays specific feature requests by customers the introduction of new products by veeco and its competitors production and quality problems changes in the cost of materials disruption in sources of supply seasonal patterns of capital spending by customers a downturn in the market for personal computers or other products incorporating data storage technology and semiconductors market acceptance of veeco s systems and veeco s customers products many of these factors are beyond veeco s control 
if veeco s net sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  veeco s operating results will be adversely affected  which may have an adverse impact on the company s common stock price 
rapid technological change  importance of timely product introduction 
the data storage and semiconductor manufacturing industries are subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
veeco s ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon the company s ability to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new and enhanced systems at competitive prices and to accurately predict technology transitions 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements by veeco s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of veeco s existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends upon a variety of factors  including veeco s product offerings timely and efficient completion of product design and development timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing processes effective sales  service and marketing product performance in the field because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both the future demand for the products under development and the equipment required to produce such products 
veeco cannot be certain that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products 
limited sales backlog 
veeco s backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all sales required to achieve veeco s sales objective for that quarter 
moreover  all customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer  generally with limited or no penalties 
therefore  backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
the company s net sales and operating results for a quarter may depend upon orders obtained for systems to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
in addition  veeco derives a substantial portion of its net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems 
as a result  the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material adverse effect on veeco s sales and operating results 
veeco s business and financial results for a particular period could be materially and adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipping during the period 
highly competitive industry 
the data storage and semiconductor capital equipment industries are intensely competitive 
established companies  both domestic and foreign  compete with each of veeco s product lines 
many of veeco s competitors have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line 
as a result  once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor s capital equipment  veeco believes that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor 
accordingly  if a particular customer selects a competitor s capital equipment  the company expects to experience difficulty in selling to that customer for a significant period of time 
the company believes that veeco s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside of veeco s control  including price product quality breadth of product line system performance cost of ownership global technical service and support success in developing or otherwise introducing new products veeco cannot be certain that it will be able to compete successfully in the future 
dependence on principal customers  industry concentration 
veeco relies on veeco s principal customers for a significant portion of veeco s sales 
veeco s principal customers include international business machines corporation ibm  seagate technology  inc seagate and read rite corp 
read rite 
the following table sets forth the percentage of veeco s net sales to such principal customers for the periods indicated year ended december  ibm seagate read rite next five top customers if the company lost a major customer  or a significant portion of veeco s sales to any major customer  it could adversely affect veeco s results of operations 
veeco s ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon veeco s ability to obtain orders from new customers 
the company cannot be certain that it will be able to do so 
in addition  a relatively small number of large manufacturers  many of whom are veeco s customers  dominate the data storage industry and  to a lesser extent  the semiconductor industry 
if any of these large manufacturers discontinues its relationship with veeco or suffers economic setbacks  veeco s results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on debt and short term investment portfolios foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses interest rates veeco centrally manages its debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
veeco s investment portfolios consist of cash equivalents  accordingly  the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end variable debt and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on net interest expense 
foreign operations operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on veeco is complex becuase such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  can cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
vecco s net sales to foreign customers represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the company expects net sales to foreign customers will continue to represent a large percentage of veeco s total net sales 
veeco s net sales denominated in foreign currencies represented approximately of veeco s total net sales in  in and in the company generally has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions 
the aggregate foreign exchange gains and losses included in determining consolidated results of operations were   and  in   and  respectively 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have been the largest impact on translating vecco s internaional operating profit include the german mark and japanese yen 
the company estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by less than million 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patters or our financing and operating strategics
