in addition  in an effort to improve customer service  authority to extend credit was decentralized and assigned to management at the retail sales centers

in fiscal year  peso denominated cost of sales and operating expenses represented approximately of the company s consolidated cost of sales and expenses 
exposure to exchange rate changes is favorable to operating results when the peso devalues against the us dollar  since peso costs exceed peso revenues 
as the peso appreciates against the us dollar  the effect is unfavorable to operating results 
in addition to the effect of exchange rate changes on operating results  foreign currency transaction gains or losses are recognized in other income and expense 
during fiscal year  the company recorded a transaction gain of approximately million 
except for peso transactions  management utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset exposure to exchange rate changes  although the number and amount of such contracts are not significant

the underlying aggregate notional amount on which the company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding was million at january  under the terms of the swap agreements  the company pays a fixed interest rate of approximately 
as of january   the swap agreements had an aggregate fair value of million  with million in effect until january  and million in effect through january  there were no interest rate swap agreements during fiscal year the peso devaluation and economic uncertainties in mexico are not expected to have a significant impact on liquidity

the united states is a party to the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 
under gatt  the united states currently imposes import duties on glazed ceramic tile from non north american countries at  to be reduced ratably to by accordingly  gatt may stimulate competition from non north american manufacturers who now export  or who may seek to export  ceramic tile to the united states 
the company cannot predict with certainty the effect that gatt may have on the company s operations 
in  mexico  the united states and canada approved the north american free trade agreement nafta 
nafta has  among other things  removed and will continue to remove  over a transition period  most normal customs duties imposed on goods traded among the three countries 
in addition  nafta will remove or limit many investment restrictions  liberalize trade in services  provide a specialized means for settlement of  and remedies for  trade disputes arising thereunder  and will result in new laws and regulations to further these goals 
although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the company s ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states  it also may stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico 
the united states currently imposes import duties on glazed ceramic tile from mexico of approximately  although these duties on imports from mexico are being phased out ratably under nafta by it is uncertain what ultimate effect nafta will have on the company s results of operations 
effects of inflation the company believes it has generally been able to enhance productivity to offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in the us and mexico

in addition  customers  suppliers and carriers have been required to certify their readiness for year through the end of fiscal year  expenses totaling million were incurred for year activities 
the modification and testing of all mission critical software and equipment  including the testing of interrelationships of all components is estimated to be completed no later than the second quarter of fiscal year  which is prior to any anticipated impact on the company s operating systems 
less critical activities  including the upgrade of stand alone equipment and monitoring of supplier and carrier progress  will continue for the balance of fiscal year the company believes that  with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on operations 
the cost of the project and the date by which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  non performance of key software and hardware vendors and similar uncertainties 
in addition  material disruptions to the operations of the company s major customers and suppliers as a result of year issues could also have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial condition 
at present  the company is preparing a detailed year contingency plan 
the contingency plan will include a more definitive risk assessment related to major customers and suppliers and how the company plans to mitigate such risk 
the plan is expected to be in place by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in this filing are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the impact of competitive pressures and changing economic conditions on the company s business and its dependence on residential and commercial construction activity  the fact that the company is highly leveraged  year issues  currency fluctuations and other factors relating to the company s foreign manufacturing operations  the impact of pending reductions in tariffs and custom duties and environmental laws and other regulations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information regarding the company s market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
the information is presented in us dollars  which is the company s reporting currency 
since all significant international operations use the us dollar as the functional currency  the company deems foreign currency risk to be minimal 
the company s major market risk exposure relates to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in us rates  the company currently maintains approximately of its debt as fixed rate by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
interest rate swap agreements are designated with a portion of the principal balance and term of a specific debt obligation
