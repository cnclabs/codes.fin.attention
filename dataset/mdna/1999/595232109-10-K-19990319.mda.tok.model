liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and cash equivalents of  at december  net cash flow provided by operating activities was   and  in   and  respectively 
the changes in cash provided by operating activities were due primarily to the factors discussed above in the comparisons of operating results 
the level of net cash provided by operating activities is also affected by the timing of receipt of revenues and the payment of operating and interest expenses

the note payable under the bank line of credit had an  balance outstanding at december  the company has received a commitment letter from its primary bank to increase its line of credit from  to  the new credit facility will be unsecured and is subject to agreement on final terms 
the company has registered to sell up to an aggregate of approximately  based on the public offering price of additional commons shares of beneficial interest and or debt securities 
the shares and debt may be issued from time to time at prices  in amounts and on terms to be determined at the time of offering 
in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  mart is required to pay dividends to its shareholders of at least of its reit taxable income 
mart intends to pay these dividends from operating cash flows 
while mart intends to distribute to its shareholders a substantial portion of its cash flows from operating activities  mart also intends to retain or reserve such amounts as it considers necessary from time to time for the acquisition or development of new properties as suitable opportunities arise and for the expansion and renovation of its shopping centers 
also  mart currently has and expects to continue to maintain a line of credit from its primary bank 
the company anticipates material commitments for capital expenditures to include  in the next two years  the ongoing redevelopment of five projects in the planning stage at an estimated cost of  to  the company expects to fund the development projects and other capital expenditures with available net cash flows from operating activities and if necessary with construction loan financing  long term mortgage financing on unencumbered operating properties or the use of its line of credit 
it is management s intention that mart continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop its business 
management cannot practically quantify mart s cash requirements  but expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through available net cash flow provided by operations and short term borrowings 
to meet its long term capital requirements  mart intends to obtain funds through additional equity offerings or long term debt financing in a manner consistent with its financial strategy 
the company anticipates that the cash flow available from operations  together with cash from borrowings and equity offerings  will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital needs in both the short and long term 
market risk information the market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial and commodity instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk relating to variable rate borrowings used to maintain liquidity eg  credit line borrowings or finance project development costs eg  construction loans 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  the company relies primarily on long term  fixed rate nonrecourse loans from institutional lenders to finance its operating properties 
in addition  long term fixed rate financing is typically arranged concurrently with or shortly after a variable rate project construction loan is negotiated or the project is complete 
the company has not used derivative financial or commodity instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored closely by management 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other data required to evaluate the expected cash flows of the company under debt agreements and its sensitivity to interest rate changes 
at december   the company s variable rate debt relates to borrowings under its credit line 
the credit line borrowings are assumed to be repaid at their various repricing dates throughout market risk information continued as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise after december   the company s hedging strategies  if any  during that period and interest rates 
fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt         weighted average interest rate variable rate debt   weighted average interest rate year issue the year issue relates to whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information to allow accurate processing of transactions and data relating to the year and beyond 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or fail 
as a result of the company s normal upgrade and replacement processes  it has been determined that all existing network and desktop equipment is year compliant 
the company s mission critical  property management and financial reporting software has also been modified to be year compliant 
the company has determined that all non mission critical software is year compliant 
as the company owns primarily community retail centers without enclosed common areas  the use of this technology is very limited and management does not believe that the year issue will pose significant problems in these systems 
the company expects that the costs to specifically remediate year information technology issues will not be significant 
the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario exposure to be indirect in nature involving vendors  suppliers  and tenants 
currently  management does not believe it is practical to measure the effects of potential complications 
the company will continually monitor and evaluate these areas and develop contingency plans on an as needed basis 
inflation the majority of leases for the shopping center properties contain provisions for annual increases in rents and or provisions  which may entitle mart to receive percentage rents  based on the tenants gross sales 
such provisions ameliorate the risk to mart of the adverse effects of inflation 
if a recession were to begin and continue for a prolonged time  funds from operations could decline as some tenants may have trouble meeting their lease obligations 
most of the leases for the properties require the tenants to pay a substantial share of operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance costs  and thereby reduce mart s exposure to increased costs 
in addition  many of the leases for the properties are for terms of less than years  which may enable mart to seek increase rents upon renewal of existing leases if rents are below the then existing market rates
