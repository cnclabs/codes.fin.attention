on february   inverness medical  inc  a subsidiary of selfcare  purchased can am care corporation  a leading supplier of diabetes care products 
we have decreased  and expect to continue to decrease  certain expenses by  among other things  eliminating duplicative management functions and combining our distribution channels with those of can am 
although we believe that synergies are present between our existing distribution channels and those of can am  we can not be certain that the integration of the can am product line with our product lines will lead to increased overall revenue or decreased spending as a percentage of revenue  or that the integration will result in other benefits customarily pursued in a strategic acquisition 
accordingly  we may not save any money and may  in fact  incur additional costs in attempting to make these changes or in attempting to mitigate any adverse consequences of the integration 
risks related to new product development some of our products are available for commercial sale  including certain professional diagnostic products for infectious diseases  women s health products produced by third party manufacturers  fasttake tm diabetes care products  blood glucose strips and nutritional supplements 
all of our other products are in various stages of research and development and are not generating revenue 
we must develop these products and perform pre clinical and clinical testing before we can sell these products to the public 
at this stage  we cannot be certain that any of the products under development will prove to be safe or effective in clinical trials  we will be able to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our products that are in development or contemplated  any of such products can be manufactured at acceptable cost and with appropriate quality  or any of such products  if and when approved  can be successfully marketed 
risks related to the lifescan alliance in  we entered into an exclusive worldwide alliance and distribution agreement with lifescan  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson 
under the terms of the alliance with lifescan  we manufacture and lifescan distributes fasttake tm  our proprietary electrochemical blood glucose monitoring system for the management of diabetes 
we commenced shipments of fasttake tm in december fasttake tm is currently the most successful product in our diabetes line of business 
our future results of operations depend to a substantial degree on lifescan s ability to market and sell fasttake tm 
although the fasttake tm product appears to be gaining acceptance  we cannot assure you that the market will fully accept fasttake tm or that any acceptance will continue 
any failure by us to produce or failure of lifescan to market and distribute fasttake tm successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon key personnel our future success is highly dependent on the services of ron zwanziger  the chairman  president and chief executive officer  and certain other members of management 
due to the specialized scientific nature of our business  our future success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific  managerial and marketing personnel  particularly as we continue to develop and expand our activities 
we face significant competition for such personnel from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel we require for continued growth 
the loss of mr 
zwanziger or one or more of the management or scientific employees could have a negative impact upon our ability to manage and operate effectively 
dependence on patents and proprietary technology  trademarks obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes is important in the medical products and diagnostic testing industries 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and manufacturing processes  to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
patents and trademarks 
we hold certain patent rights  have certain patent applications pending  and expect to seek additional patents in the future 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be successful or timely in obtaining any such patents 
the patent position of medical products and diagnostic testing companies is often highly uncertain and usually involves complex legal and factual questions 
furthermore  the us patent and trademark office has not set forth a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims covered in medical products patents 
therefore  we cannot be certain that any issued patents will provide adequate protection for our products 
if such patents are limited in scope  our competitors may be able to design around such patents 
in the medical products industry  including the diagnostic testing industry  there is extensive litigation regarding patents  licenses and other intellectual property rights 
we periodically incur  and will likely continue to incur  costs related to defending potential infringement claims or asserting such claims against others 
to determine the priority of inventions  we may also have to participate in interference proceedings to determine the scope of patents issued by the patent and trademark office which could also result in substantial costs 
in april of  abbott laboratories  inc filed a lawsuit against us and princeton biomeditech corporation which manufactures our pregnancy detection and ovulation prediction products 
abbott alleges that these products infringe a patent under which abbott claims to have exclusive rights 
in october   abbott filed a lawsuit against us alleging that our glucose monitoring system  fasttake tm  infringes upon a patent held by abbott 
although we believe that the pregnancy detection and ovulation prediction products and fasttake tm do not infringe upon these patents  we have already incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs in defending against abbott s claims 
furthermore  under the distribution agreement with lifescan  we agreed to indemnify lifescan for any damage  including expenses incurred by it  resulting from any claims that fasttake tm infringes any patents 
for a more in depth discussion of this litigation  see the section entitled litigation 
licensing of technology 
we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties to market their products 
we do not know if we will be able to obtain licenses under any such patents or proprietary rights on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain necessary licenses  we could encounter delays in product introductions while attempting to design products that do not infringe on the patents or other rights which we are unable to license  or we may be unable to develop  manufacture or sell such products in certain countries or at all 
other proprietary technology 
we seek to protect proprietary technology  including technology that may not be patented  or patentable  in part through confidentiality agreements and  if applicable  inventors rights agreements with collaborators  advisors  employees and consultants 
if the parties breach these agreements  we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
although we take actions to prevent the disclosure of confidential information  we cannot be certain that our trade secrets will not otherwise be revealed to  or discovered by  competitors 
moreover  we may from time to time conduct research through academic advisors and collaborators who may be prohibited by their academic institutions from entering into confidentiality or inventor s rights agreements 
competition  risk of technological obsolescence self test products 
the medical products industry  including the diagnostic testing industry  is rapidly evolving and developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
competition in this industry is intense and expected to increase as new products and technologies become available and new competitors enter the market 
our competitors in the united states and abroad are numerous and include  among others  diagnostic testing and medical products companies  universities and other research institutions 
our future success depends upon our maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in our areas of focus 
competitors may be more successful in developing technologies and products that are more effective than our products or that render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive  obtaining patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would prevent us from developing our potential products  or obtaining regulatory approval for the commercialization of their products more rapidly or effectively than we are able to do so 
many of our existing or potential competitors have or may have substantially greater research and development capabilities  clinical  manufacturing  regulatory and marketing experience and financial and managerial resources 
we are seeking to develop and market generic test strips which are compatible with other manufacturers electrochemical blood glucose monitoring systems including excel tm  which is compatible with the exactech tm system sold by medisense  inc others may attempt to enter this market with similar products or the manufacturers of the systems with which such test strips are compatible may lower their own test strip prices 
this would reduce or eliminate our competitive price advantage 
additionally  several of our competitors are attempting to develop noninvasive blood glucose monitoring technology 
noninvasive blood glucose monitoring involves methods for measuring blood glucose levels without the need to draw blood and  in certain proposed configurations  without the need to utilize disposable components  such as test strips 
we believe that manufacturers are pursuing a number of different technological approaches to noninvasive blood glucose monitoring  including near infrared spectroscopy  which involves shining a beam of near infrared light to penetrate the skin and determine the amount of glucose in the blood  and reverse iontophoresis  which utilizes a patch system to extract glucose through the skin for measurement by an external meter 
in addition  several manufacturers are pursuing minimally invasive approaches to blood glucose monitoring  such as using a fine needle to withdraw a small sample of interstitial fluid which is analyzed by use of mid infrared spectroscopy 
the successful development and introduction of any such products could reduce the demand for meters and test trips such as fasttake tm and excel tm 
nutritional supplements 
the market for the sale of vitamins and nutritional supplements is highly competitive 
this competition is based principally upon price  quality of products  customer service and marketing support 
there are numerous companies in the vitamin and nutritional supplement industry selling products to retailers such as mass merchandisers  drug store chains  independent drug stores  supermarkets and health food stores 
as most of these companies are privately held  we are unable to obtain the information necessary to assess precisely the size and success of these competitors 
however  we believe that a number of our competitors  particularly manufacturers of nationally advertised brand name products  are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial resources 
effect of adverse publicity  scientific research our nutritional supplement lines contain vitamins  minerals  herbs and other ingredients that we generally regard as safe when taken as directed 
various scientific studies have suggested such vitamins  minerals and herbs may offer certain health benefits 
however  the success of such products is highly dependent upon consumers perception of safety and quality of the nutritional supplement lines as well as similar products distributed by competitors 
we believe that the recent growth of the nutritional supplements market is based  in part  on recent scientific research suggesting potential health benefits from regular consumption of certain vitamins and other nutritional products and the attention focused on such benefits by the media 
the scientific research to date is preliminary and therefore it is possible that future scientific results could be unfavorable or inconsistent and media attention could be unfavorable 
this could result in a significant decline in sales of the nutritional supplement products 
comprehensive government regulation self test products 
our research  development and clinical programs  and manufacturing and marketing operations  are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and in other countries 
at this time we do not have the required governmental approvals for commercial sale of most of our self test products  including those licensed from third parties 
we expect that some approvals will not be obtained for several years 
the food and drug administration and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities will review our pre clinical and clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of many of our products 
this regulatory process can take many years and may require us to spend substantial amounts of money and other resources 
the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities may interpret data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities in ways that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or may reject approval based upon future  unknown changes to regulatory policies 
such delays may prevent us from marketing and selling these products 
moreover  even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  the fda and foreign authorities may impose limitations on the indicated uses or methods of use for a product 
this could limit the way in which we market such product 
furthermore  even after granting approval  the fda or other regulatory agencies may continue to review and inspect a marketed product  the manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities 
if the fda or the foreign authorities discover previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility  they may restrict or prohibit the sale of the product 
if we fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements  the fda or foreign authorities may impose fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
regulatory requirements in countries outside the united states can change rapidly with relatively short notice 
it is possible that changes in such regulations may result in products being banned in certain countries  causing us to lose revenues and income 
foreign regulatory agencies could also introduce testing changes which  if not quickly addressed  could result in restrictions on sales of our products 
such changes are not uncommon as such regulatory authorities may react and respond to advances in basic research and the nature of certain infectious diseases and agents such as hiv  as some of these diseases are mutating viruses capable of producing new strains and subtypes 
nutritional supplements 
federal agencies  including the fda  the federal trade commission and the consumer product safety commission  regulate the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling and advertising of nutritional supplements 
various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries where we sell or may sell the nutritional supplement lines may also regulate our activities 
the dietary supplement health and education act of enacted on october   defines dietary supplements as a new category of food separate from conventional food 
the fda has finalized certain regulations to implement the dietary supplement health and education act of  including those relating to nutritional labeling requirements  but it has not finalized other regulations 
under the dietary supplement health and education act of  we are required to have different labeling for the nutritional supplement lines and  with respect to nutritional supplement products under development  we are subject to new notification procedures and scientific proof requirements regarding ingredients  product claims and safety 
we cannot determine how  or if  these regulations will affect business in the future 
if we do not comply with applicable fda requirements  the fda could impose sanctions and penalties  including warning letters  product recalls and seizures  injunctions or criminal prosecution 
although not yet final  we anticipate that the fda will enact specific standards under the law to regulate the manufacturing of dietary supplements 
the current proposal standards are similar to the current standards for food and we believe that the current manufacturing process of our nutritional supplement lines will be in compliance with the proposed standards for dietary supplements 
however  we cannot be certain that the final standards for dietary supplements will not change in ways that require changes in the manufacture of the nutritional supplement lines 
litigation the company encounters many risks associated with litigation concerning  among other things  the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights 
for information on the risks involved  please see item legal proceedings 
risks related to the year issue the statements in the following section include year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act of background 
the term year issue is a general term used to describe various problems that may result from the improper processing by computer systems of dates after these problems arise from the inability of some hardware and software to distinguish dates before the year from dates in and after the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and all organizations 
our efforts to address the year issue are focused in the following areas reviewing and taking any necessary steps to attempt to correct our computer information systems  including software applications and hardware platforms  evaluating and making any necessary modifications to other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology  such as telecommunications  security  fire and safety systems  and communicating with certain significant customers  suppliers and service providers to determine whether there will be any interruption in their systems that could affect us 
our state of readiness 
we have developed a four phase plan to address the year issues 
the four phases are awareness  assessment  remediation  and testing 
awareness 
we have made the relevant employees aware of the year issue and collected information from such employees regarding systems that might be affected 
we have established a project team to lead our efforts  and management will oversee the progress with respect to the implementation of the year plan 
in addition  the year plan will be subject to the review of the board of directors 
assessment 
we have substantially completed an assessment of our standard computer information systems and we are now taking the further necessary steps to make our core computer information systems  in those situations in which we are required to do so  year compliant 
we are in the process of obtaining written verification from vendors to the effect that our other standard computer information systems acquired from such vendors correctly distinguish dates before the year from dates in and after the year we expect that most vendors will provide us with such verifications  or commitments to provide solutions  by may  in addition  we are currently evaluating and assessing our other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology  such as telecommunications  security  fire and safety systems  and expect that our assessment will be completed by may  we are aware that such systems contain embedded chips that are difficult to identify and test and may require complete replacement because they cannot be repaired 
we are seeking written verification from our significant customers  suppliers  and service providers that they will be year compliant by no later than may  we do not believe that there is a significant risk related to the failure of vendors or third party service providers to prepare for the year however  the costs and timing of third party year compliance is not within our control and we cannot be certain of the cost or timing of such efforts or the potential effects of any failure of our customers  suppliers or service providers to comply 
remediation 
our primary use of software systems is in our accounting and electronic data interface software 
we also use programmable logic controls in manufacturing operations at our facility in inverness  scotland 
we have received written verification from our vendor of the accounting software used in our corporate office that the software is year compliant 
we expect an upgrade for our electronic data interface software that has been designed to be year compliant by may  the programmatic logic controls are in the process of being tested for year compliance 
testing 
to attempt to confirm that our computer systems are year compliant  we expect to perform limited testing of our computer information systems and our other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology 
unless year issues arise in the course of our limited testing  we will rely on the written verification  when and if received  from each vendor of our computer systems that the relevant system is year compliant 
nevertheless  we cannot be certain that the computer systems on which we rely will correctly distinguish dates before the year from dates in and after the year any failure to distinguish the dates could have an adverse effect on our operations 
testing of some systems is in process and we currently expect that our testing will be complete by may  we have tested the software in the fasttake tm blood glucose monitoring system and believe that it is year compliant 
costs to address our year issues 
we anticipate that the primary cost of year compliance will be the cost of testing 
because our year assessment is ongoing and additional funds may be required as a result of future findings  we are not currently able to estimate the final aggregate cost of addressing the year issue 
while these efforts will involve additional costs  we believe  based on available information  that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we expect to fund the costs of addressing the year issue from cash flows resulting from operations and additional capital  either through borrowing and or issuance of debt or equity securities 
while we believe that we will be year compliant by december   if these efforts are not completed on time  or if the costs associated with updating or replacing our computer systems exceed our estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks presented by year issues 
we are still in the process of evaluating potential disruptions or complications that might result from year related problems  however  at this time we have not identified any specific business functions that we know will suffer material disruption as a result of year related events 
it is possible  however  that we may identify business functions in the future that are specifically at risk of year disruption 
the absence of any such determination at this point represents only our current status of evaluating potential year related problems 
this should not be construed to mean that there is no risk of year related problems and facts presently known to us  and should not be construed to mean that there is no risk of year related disruption 
moreover  due to the unique and pervasive nature of the year issue  it is impracticable to anticipate each of the wide variety of year events  particularly outside of selfcare  that might arise in a worst case scenario and which might have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our contingency plans 
we intend to develop contingency plans for significant business risks that might result from year related events  if necessary 
because we have not identified any specific business function that will be materially at risk of significant year related disruptions  and because a full assessment of the risk from potential year failures is still in process  we have not yet developed detailed contingency plans specific to year problems 
development of these contingency plans is currently scheduled to occur before may   and as otherwise appropriate 
the preceding year readiness disclosure contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements represent our beliefs or expectations regarding future events 
all forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results 
factors that may cause these differences include  but are not limited to the availability of qualified personnel and other information technology resources  the ability to identify and remediate all date sensitive lines of computer code or to replace embedded computer chips in affected systems or equipment  and the actions of governmental agencies or other third parties with respect to year problems 
risks related to the conversion to the euro on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their sovereign currencies and the euro and adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
as a result  the euro now trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the participating countries have issued sovereign debt exclusively in euro  and redenominated outstanding debt 
beginning january   the participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions and will withdraw all bills and coins denominated in their sovereign currencies by july   making the conversion to the euro complete 
certain of our european subsidiaries may need to adapt their information technology systems to accommodate euro denominated transactions  even if they are not located in countries which are members of the european union 
in addition  it is likely that there will be a greater transparency of pricing in the participating countries  making europe a more competitive environment 
our european subsidiaries may need to respond by adjusting their business and financial strategies 
the effect of any such adaptations or adjustments has not been quantified at this time 
however  we do not believe that the consequences of the euro conversion will have a material effect on us  although no assurances can be given that it will not 
we have manufacturing facilities in galway  ireland  yavne  israel  and inverness  scotland  and sales and marketing offices in germany and belgium  and we market our products in several international markets 
limited operating history  history of operating losses and accumulated deficit  uncertain profitability we have not had significant profits since we began operations 
as of september   our accumulated deficit totaled approximately million 
for the nine months ended september   we had revenues of approximately million and a net loss of approximately million 
in order to continue developing products  we must expend substantial resources to conduct research and pre clinical and clinical development programs  to establish manufacturing facilities  sales and marketing capabilities  and to establish additional quality control and regulatory and administrative capabilities 
we may lose substantial and  perhaps  increasing amounts of money  over the next several years as our product programs expand and various clinical trials commence 
we do not know when  or if  we will make money because our profitability depends on a number of uncertainties 
fluctuations in results of operations  volatility of share price our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to factors such as the timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in manufacturing costs or other expenses  competitive pricing pressures  the gain or loss of significant distribution outlets or customers  increased research and development expenses  or general economic conditions 
in addition  it is possible that in some future periods the results of our operations will be below the expectations of the public market 
in any such event  the market price of the common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  the stock market may experience significant price and volume fluctuations which may affect the market price of the common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 
the market price of the common stock may be highly volatile and may be affected by such factors as our quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  or the health care industry  government regulation in the health care industry  changes in other areas such as tax laws  sales of substantial amounts of common stock or the perception that such sales could occur  including as a result of the conversion or potential conversion of convertible securities issued by us  or other developments affecting us or our competitors 
control by certain stockholders our executive officers and directors owned as of february   approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  these persons may have the ability to control selfcare s board of directors  and  therefore  our business  policies and affairs 
anti takeover effect of certificate of incorporation and by law provisions and delaware law our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws contain certain provisions relating to corporate governance and the rights of stockholders 
these provisions may be deemed to have a potential anti takeover effect since such provisions may delay  defer or prevent a change in control of selfcare 
these provisions make more difficult  and may in fact discourage  a proxy contest to change control of selfcare and therefore may in turn have an adverse affect on our stock price 
effect of issuance of preferred stock our board of directors is currently authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in the future without further stockholder approval and upon such terms and conditions  and having such rights  privileges and preferences  as they may determine 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  if selfcare were to sell additional shares of preferred stock  it could become more difficult for a third party to acquire control of  or make acquisition bids for  selfcare 
this  in turn  could affect the price of the shares of our common stock 
effect of conversions of convertible preferred stock and senior subordinated convertible notes we have authorized shares of series a convertible preferred stock  par value 
per share  series b convertible preferred stock  par value 
per share  series c convertible preferred stock  par value 
per share  series d convertible preferred stock  par value 
per share  and series e convertible preferred stock  par value 
per share 
we have outstanding  shares of series b convertible preferred stock   shares of series c convertible preferred stock   shares of series d convertible preferred stock and  shares of series e convertible preferred stock 
our series b convertible preferred stock and our senior subordinated convertible notes issued october   as amended january   contain variable conversion ratio provisions 
the terms of the series b convertible preferred stock and  in the event of certain defaults thereunder  the senior subordinated convertible notes provide that  subject to certain limitations  as the price of our common stock declines the number of shares of common stock into which the holders may convert such securities increases 
accordingly  if our stock price falls the result may be that the holders of the convertible securities with variable conversion ratios can convert such securities for a greater number of shares of our common stock than previously obtainable by such holder  thereby resulting in an increase in the potential dilution to all existing common stock holders 
cautionary statements concerning forward looking statements statements made in this document include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of also  documents we subsequently file with the commission and incorporate by reference will contain forward looking statements 
these statements include  among other things  statements regarding our intent  belief or expectations and those of our directors and officers with respect to our ability to develop new products and integrate new product lines  our ability to manage growth  our ability to successfully market new products in general  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing  our ability to successfully prosecute and defend litigation  general economic conditions  and trends affecting our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we caution you that  while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs  they are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements as a result of factors outside of our control 
in addition  we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through its investing and borrowing activities 
in addition  the company s ability to finance future acquisition transactions may be impacted if the company is unable to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates 
the company s investing strategy  to manage interest rate exposure  is to invest in short term  highly liquid investments 
currently  the company s short term investments are in money market funds with original maturities of days or less 
at december   the fair value of the company s short term investments approximated market value 
in february   the company s subsidiary  imi  entered into a million credit agreement with chase 
the credit agreement consists of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
the term loan and revolving line of credit allow imi to borrow funds at varying rates  including options to borrow at an alternate base rate plus a spread from 
to  or the libor rate plus a spread from to 
the spreads depend on imi s ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda 
imi entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of march  this agreement protects approximately of imi s term loan against libor interest rates rising over 
this agreement is effective through march  foreign currency risk the company faces exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments to hedge economic exposures or for trading 
historically  the company s primary exposures have been related to the operations of its european subsidiaries 
however  the sales of fasttake  the company s lead diabetes management product  are denominated in the currency in which the manufacturing costs are incurred 
in  the net impact of foreign currency changes was not material 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union has taken place in the company s fiscal year the company has not determined the impact  if any  that the euro will have on foreign exposure 
the company intends to hedge against fluctuations in the euro if this exposure becomes material 
at december   the assets related to non dollar denominated currencies was approximately million
