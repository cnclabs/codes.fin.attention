item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautions about forward looking statements this form k includes forward looking statements about future financial results  future products and other events that have not yet occurred 
for example  statements like we expect  we anticipate or we believe are forward looking statements 
investors should be aware that actual results may differ materially from our expressed expectations because of risks and uncertainties about the future 
we will not necessarily update the information in this form k if any forward looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate 
details about risks affecting various aspects of our business are discussed throughout this form k and include the risks identified in the first paragraph on page overview in this section of the k we are providing more detailed information about our operating results and changes in financial position over the past three years 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page revenue for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal an increase of 
excluding the impact of our lacerte and cri acquisitions  revenue growth in fiscal would have been 
we reported net income of million for fiscal  including million in pre tax net gains from marketable securities 
in fiscal we had a net loss of million 
excluding net gains from marketable securities  discontinued operations  gains from divestitures  acquisition related costs and restructuring charges  net income would have been million in fiscal and million in fiscal while desktop software and financial supplies continued to provide most of our revenue in fiscal  our internet based revenue grew rapidly 
as the internet has continued to change the way we do business  we have increased our investment in internet initiatives 
intuit s mission is to revolutionize how people manage their financial activities 
as we execute our mission  we have embarked on a strategy to greatly expand the world of electronic finance 
electronic finance encompasses three types of products and services desktop software products  such as quicken  quickbooks and turbotax  that automate financial tasks  products and services  such as quicken 
com  quickenmortgage and webturbotax  that are delivered via the internet  and products and services  such as quickbooks online payroll service  that connect internet based services with desktop software to enable customers to integrate their financial activities 
see overview in item  part i of this form k page for additional information on our business strategy 
within our electronic finance framework  we use the term internet based revenue to include revenue from both internet enabled products and services as well as revenue from electronic distribution 
internet products and services include activities where the customer realizes the value of the goods or services directly on the internet or an intuit server 
internet product revenues include  for example  advertising revenues generated on our quicken 
com website  online tax preparation and electronic filing revenues  online payroll service revenue and transaction and processing fees from our online insurance and online mortgage services 
electronic distribution includes revenues generated by electronic ordering and or delivery of traditional desktop software products and financial supplies 
while we believe the internet provides an opportunity to increase revenue in fiscal  we also anticipate increased spending in an effort to capitalize on new business opportunities 
in particular  we expect increased research and development expenses due to investments in internet based initiatives 
we also anticipate increased selling and marketing expenses related to these initiatives and as a result of more intense competition in the personal tax market during fiscal internet based revenue was approximately of total revenue for fiscal approximately for internet products and services  and for electronic distribution 
internet based revenues cut across all of our business divisions 
as a result  we do not report internet based revenues separately in our financial statements  instead  each of our business divisions reports internet based revenues that are specific to its operations and are included in its results 
our business is highly seasonal 
sales of tax products are heavily concentrated from november through march 
sales of consumer finance and small business products are typically strongest during the year end holiday buying season  and therefore major product launches usually occur in the fall to take advantage of this customer buying pattern 
these seasonal patterns mean that revenue is usually strongest during the quarters ending january and april we experience lower revenues for the quarters ending july  and october  while operating expenses to develop and manage products and services continue during these periods 
this can result in significant operating losses in the july and october quarters 
operating results can also fluctuate for other reasons such as changes in product release dates  non recurring events such as acquisitions  dispositions  gains and losses from marketable securities  and product price cuts in quarters with relatively high fixed expenses 
acquisitions and dispositions in particular have a significant impact on the comparability of both our quarterly and yearly results  and our acquisitions have had a negative impact on earnings 
acquisition related charges were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  and will continue to impact earnings for the next several years 
results of operations set forth below are certain consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal years  and results for exclude all revenues and expenses for our divested parsons subsidiary 
since parsons was divested for our entire fiscal year  we believe this comparison provides a more meaningful analysis of our results when comparing fiscal to fiscal fiscal and fiscal results are being presented and compared on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis  since neither year includes operating activity from our divested parsons subsidiary 
fiscal results include operating activity from our lacerte subsidiary which was acquired in june and three months of activity from our cri subsidiary which was acquired in may cri s operating activities are not included in either our fiscal or results 
fiscal results include approximately six weeks of lacerte s operations representing activity from the date of acquisition through our fiscal year end in july lacerte s operating activities are not included in our fiscal results 
we recognize revenue from sales of our desktop software products when products are shipped  less reserves for expected returns and rebates from both the retail and direct distribution channels 
these reserves are difficult to estimate  especially for seasonal products 
if actual returns or rebate redemptions are significantly higher than our estimated reserves  this could have a material negative impact on our revenue and operating results 
see note for additional information regarding net revenue 
net revenue since the business of selling software and related services is considerably different from our supplies business  we break them out separately for financial reporting purposes  as follows dollars in millions change change excluding parsons gaap gaap software and related services of net revenue supplies of net revenue total the following revenue discussion is categorized by our business divisions  which is how we examine results internally 
our domestic supplies business is considered a part of our small business division while the international supplies business is considered part of our international division 
each business division s percentage of total consolidated revenue for fiscal is as follows business division of revenue small business tax consumer finance international total for more information regarding our business segments  see note during the fiscal year ended july   our overall revenue increased by compared to fiscal a large portion of this growth is the result of our acquisition of lacerte software in june and the inclusion of a full year of lacerte s operations in our results for fiscal  compared to the inclusion of approximately six weeks of lacerte operating results for fiscal in addition  fiscal revenue included three months of operating results from our acquisition of cri in may if  for comparison purposes  we were to exclude the impact of lacerte in fiscal and results  and also exclude the impact of cri from fiscal results  overall revenue growth would have been in fiscal compared to fiscal this reflects continued growth in our small business division  a successful year of tax product sales and the growth of internet initiatives across the company in fiscal for the fiscal year ended july   our overall revenue decreased by compared to fiscal  due primarily to the loss of revenue as a result of the disposition of our parsons subsidiary in august if  for comparison purposes  parsons revenue was excluded from fiscal  our revenue in fiscal would have been higher than in fiscal small business division 
small business division revenues come primarily from the following sources o quickbooks product line o supplies products including checks  envelopes and invoices o payroll related transaction and subscription fees o support fees for the quickbooks support network overall  revenue for the division increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was largely due to the timing of recent quickbooks releases that occurred in june version and january quickbooks  and the inclusion of three months of revenue from cri in fiscal results 
prior to the quickbooks releases  we had not launched a new version of quickbooks since december version 
as a result  fiscal compares favorably to fiscal  which did not realize the benefit of a new quickbooks product release for the majority of the fiscal year 
fiscal revenues also benefited from an increase in revenue per customer  due primarily to an improvement in the mix of quickbooks sales toward higher priced  greater functionality products 
domestic supplies revenues  which are part of the small business division  grew by in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our increasing base of small business customers who use quickbooks and quicken 
though they are a smaller component of small business division revenues  when compared to domestic supplies revenues  tax tables service revenue and quickbooks support network revenues also increased substantially in fiscal compared to fiscal in october  we introduced quickbooks online payroll service 
the service is offered through our quickbooks pro products version and quickbooks and performs all aspects of payroll processing 
to support the payroll service we have made significant systems and infrastructure investments and have incurred activation and set up costs for new payroll service customers 
we expect the quickbooks online payroll service to remain unprofitable until we are able to accumulate a large number of subscribers who have used the service long enough for us to recover up front costs related to the service 
in connection with this new payroll service business and consistent with our strategy to expand products and service offerings to our small business customers  we completed our acquisition of computing resources  inc cri on may  see note 
cri has been our payroll processing service provider since october cri s operating activity from the acquisition date forward is included in our results 
the acquisition of cri will result in significant future acquisition related costs  as well as new business risks and integration challenges common in all acquisitions 
for example  if we are unable to provide accurate and timely payroll information  cash deposits or tax return filings  that failure could be costly to correct and may have a significant negative impact on our ability to attract and retain customers  who we believe will have a low tolerance for payroll processing errors 
our ability to successfully operate cri will depend in part on retaining their existing customers and maintaining relationships with certain banks and other third parties who we will rely on to retain existing customers and attract new customers outside of our quickbooks customer base 
if we are unable to do so  it could result in a negative impact on our revenue 
small business division revenues increased by in compared to these results were affected by the timing of the quickbooks product release which did not occur until june despite the release date late in the fiscal year  quickbooks revenues benefited from a favorable shift in consumer buying patterns to higher priced  increased functionality quickbooks products in fiscal compared to fiscal supplies net revenue increased by in fiscal over fiscal as the result of an increasing small business customer base 
increased tax table service revenues and an expanded fee for support program which began charging users for telephone assistance with their quickbooks products beginning in fiscal also contributed to growth for the division 
tax division 
tax division revenues come primarily from the following sources o turbo tax and macintax personal tax preparation products o professional tax preparation products proseries and lacerte product lines o electronic tax return preparation and filing fees overall  revenue for the division increased in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal included operating results for our lacerte subsidiary which was acquired in june  while fiscal results did not include lacerte prior to june if we were to exclude lacerte from our fiscal results  tax division revenues would have increased by 
growth in our tax business was driven by our turbotax product line which experienced significantly higher unit sales due in part to an increasing number of taxpayers using personal computers to prepare tax returns 
this unit sales growth was partially offset by lower average selling prices due to a higher percentage of customers buying our lower priced regular products compared to deluxe versions  and increased price competition  primarily from h r block s aggressively priced taxcut product 
turbotax results benefited from strong growth in industry wide retail sales of personal tax products  though turbotax growth was lower than the industry growth rate  resulting in a slight decline in retail market share 
though they are a smaller component of tax division revenues  we also experienced significant revenue increases for our webturbotax product and electronic filing service compared to last year as a greater number of customers gained internet access and became more accustomed to processing transactions on line 
through our quicken tax freedom program  we also offered free online tax preparation and electronic filing for taxpayers with  or less of income 
this program did not have a material impact on our fiscal tax revenues  as the average income of our current customers and their clients is above the  income threshold 
in august  we acquired securetax 
com  another provider of online tax preparation and electronic filing services  for approximately million 
see note of the financial statements for additional information about this acquisition 
while we believe that the increasing popularity of the internet will provide future revenue growth opportunities for these internet based tax offerings  there are also risks  such as the significant negative financial and public relations consequences which can result from service interruptions 
we experienced a brief interruption in our electronic filing services in february and on april  routine server maintenance procedures took longer than expected  resulting in a hour outage for the electronic filing service 
we do not believe this service outage had a material financial impact  prevented customers from completing and filing their returns in a timely manner  or posed a risk that customer data would be lost or corrupted 
however  we did experience negative publicity 
the exact level of future demand for web turbotax and electronic filing will be very difficult to predict  and in future tax seasons we could experience adverse financial and public relations consequences if these services are unavailable due to technical difficulties or other reasons 
though microsoft corporation did not release a competing product for this tax season  we believe they will enter the personal tax preparation software market next year 
if microsoft enters the market  their superior financial resources and strong presence in retail distribution channels could result in an increasingly competitive environment next tax season and beyond 
if the average selling price of our tax products were to decrease  or if we were to lose significant market share as a result of increased future competition  our revenues and operating income would suffer 
see also business competition  on page excluding lacerte from fiscal operating results  our professional tax proseries product sales increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth occurred primarily because we were successful in retaining our customers from prior years and in many cases have upgraded them to higher priced products 
revenue from lacerte products also grew compared to last year though lacerte s prior year revenues are not reported in our operating results prior to their june acquisition due in part to price increases and a high customer retention rate 
tax division revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth reflected higher sales of our turbotax products in fiscal and a sales mix improvement to higher priced deluxe products 
the personal tax market was more competitive in fiscal than fiscal because our primary competitor lowered its prices earlier in the tax software sales season in fiscal despite intense competition  we achieved sales increases largely due to positive product reviews in the press  federal tax law changes enacted in late and an expanded investment in retail distribution 
we were also successful in getting our turbotax products to market more quickly in fiscal and experienced growth in internet commerce revenues as a result of increases in electronic filing and state tax product downloads compared to fiscal our professional tax pro series products also experienced a revenue increase for fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of high customer retention rates and transitioning customers to higher priced  greater functionality products 
consumer finance division 
consumer finance division revenues come primarily from the following sources o quicken product line o advertising and sponsorship fees from the consumer areas of our quicken 
com website o implementation  marketing and transaction fees from financial institutions including marketspace participants providing services through quicken and quicken 
com overall  revenue for the division increased in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding the impact of a nonrecurring million royalty fee from checkfree in fiscal  revenue growth would have been in fiscal quicken revenue grew by in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting an approximately week earlier product release in fiscal and higher unit sales resulting from our quicken turbotax bundle promotion 
this was partially offset by a higher percentage of customers purchasing our lower priced quicken basic products compared to our quicken deluxe versions  the fact that we did not introduce a new quicken for mac product in fiscal  and increased rebate incentives offered to customers who purchased the quicken turbotax bundle 
our quicken product line faces many challenges in the desktop personal financial software market 
for example  there is increasing competition from microsoft s money product 
in addition  personal financial software functionality is increasingly becoming available on the internet at no cost  which has a negative impact on desktop product sales 
there is also an increasing emphasis on packaging desktop software with original equipment manufacturers personal computers  which results in lower revenues per unit shipped 
in fiscal  quicken experienced over a decline in revenues and there is no assurance that similar declines will not occur in the future 
for example  revenue could suffer if customers become less inclined to make upgrade purchases  if our competitors were to lower their prices  or if personal finance software functionality becomes increasingly available at no cost via the internet 
consumer finance division revenue growth was primarily the result of increased internet based revenues which approximately doubled in fiscal  compared to fiscal this increase was largely due to higher advertising  sponsorship and transaction related revenue through quicken 
com and quicken 
however  revenue growth was not uniform across all internet product and service offerings 
for example  advertising revenue and transaction fees from our quickenmortgage marketspace increased relatively rapidly while revenue from our insuremarket marketspace was roughly flat for fiscal compared to fiscal on october   we announced the proposed acquisition of rock financial corporation  a provider of consumer mortgages 
if completed  this acquisition would allow us to facilitate the application  approval and closing process 
rock will perform loan processing functions similar to those that are currently provided by mortgage 
com under a distribution  marketing  facilities and services agreement with intuit 
this agreement with mortgage 
com will be terminated and phased out over the next twelve months see note 
growth in mortgage transaction fees may be adversely impacted if interest rates continue to rise 
the negative impact of interest rate increases could be exacerbated by the acquisition of rock because of our increased fixed cost infrastructure 
the rapid growth we ve experienced in our internet products and services has been generated in part by distribution agreements we entered into with third party online service and content providers such as excite home and aol  which have helped to increase traffic to our quicken 
com website 
our agreement with excite home see note calls for us to share certain revenue generated from our quicken 
com site and our agreement with aol see note calls for us to make significant guaranteed payments to aol over the term of the agreement 
while the internet provides a significant opportunity for revenue growth  our financial commitments to these and other third party providers are significant and we must continue to increase traffic and revenue in order to be profitable 
if our website traffic expectations aren t met  there could be a significant negative impact on our revenue 
our ability to maintain important relationships with distributors and content providers will also have an impact on traffic and revenues 
see special risks for internet products and services  on page overall  consumer finance division revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal our quicken product sales were up slightly for the year  reflecting a more favorable sales mix toward our higher priced products  offset by lower overall unit sales 
growth for the division was driven by increasing internet product revenues  which approximately doubled in fiscal compared to fiscal this growth was generated in part by collaborating with third party online service and content providers such as excite home and aol  which helped to increase traffic to our quicken 
com website 
international division 
international division revenues come primarily from the following sources o japanese small business products o german quicken  quickbooks and tax products o canadian quicken  quickbooks and tax products o united kingdom quicken and quickbooks products in addition to the above  we also operate in smaller european  asian and latin american markets 
overall  revenue for the division increased approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting strong fiscal fourth quarter revenues in canada  japan and germany 
this increase was attributable to increased revenues in canada across all product lines  with particular strength in our quickbooks and quicken product lines 
in germany  we experienced strong sales in the fourth quarter due to new releases of our quicken and quickbooks products 
finally  while the overall market for small business products and services in japan  our largest international subsidiary  continues to suffer due primarily to poor economic conditions  we experienced higher sales in the fourth quarter due to higher sales of our quickbooks and yayoi product lines  and more favorable currency exchange rates 
as part of our business strategy  we have refocused our european operations toward small business customers in selected larger markets and towards improving profitability 
in june  we entered into an agreement with lexware a subsidiary of rudolf haufe publishing  a leading business software company in germany  under which lexware will develop  market and distribute intuit s products and services in germany under the intuit brand 
under this agreement  lexware will receive all revenues from the distribution of intuit s products  and we will receive royalty payments as compensation 
we believe that lexware s local expertise will result in more effective development and delivery of customized products and services to our customers in germany 
as a result  we expect reduced revenues from our european operations in fiscal  but also expect increased profitability 
international division revenues were down approximately in fiscal compared to fiscal this reflected lower revenues in europe  which were offset by roughly flat revenues in japan and higher revenues in canada 
in fiscal  we launched a new version of quicken throughout europe and a new version of quickbooks in germany 
in japan  revenues were negatively impacted by an economic slowdown  increasing competition in the high end small business accounting market and a weak japanese currency 
this was partially offset by increased revenues resulting from our acquisition of nihon micom see note 
in canada  we experienced significant revenue growth from our quicktax  quicken and quickbooks products 
cost of goods sold dollars in millions change change excluding parsons gaap gaap product of revenue amortization of purchased software and other of revenue there are two components of cost of goods sold 
the largest is the direct cost of manufacturing and delivering products and services 
the second component is the amortization of purchased technology  which is the cost of products or services obtained through acquisitions 
total cost of goods sold increased to of revenue in fiscal  compared to for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to two factors 
first  consistent with our growing internet based business  we are experiencing a significant increase in related hardware and infrastructure costs as we purchase equipment to increase our internet capability 
these costs are classified as cost of goods sold and  as a percentage of revenue  are significantly higher than the costs of goods sold for our traditional desktop software business 
these infrastructure costs tend to result from the depreciation of capital assets which are generally expensed evenly over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
as a result  cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate significantly  particularly on a quarterly basis  as costs become more fixed in nature 
for example  in a quarter with low revenues we will usually have a proportionately lower cost of goods sold because we ship fewer products  the cost of goods sold from our internet infrastructure will not decrease proportionately and thus will result in higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for that quarter 
second  we have also experienced significant increases in our service costs for fee for support programs and our payroll business 
the cost of goods sold associated with these programs is also larger as a percentage of revenue than cost of goods sold for our traditional desktop software business 
consequently  as revenues from our internet and service related programs become a larger portion of our overall revenue  our cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is likely to increase 
if we experience errors in current or future products  there could be incremental increases in cost of goods sold that could adversely affect our operating results 
during fiscal  we improved the efficiency of our order taking process in the financial supplies business  which reduced re order expenses and partially offset the increases to cost of goods sold described above 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  cost of goods sold decreased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal this improvement was the result of our customers buying more cd rom products  which were less expensive to manufacture and ship than disk based products that were also offered in fiscal we also improved the efficiency of our order taking process in the financial supplies business  which reduced re order expenses 
operating expenses dollars in millions change change excluding parsons gaap gaap customer service and technical support of revenue selling and marketing of revenue research and development of revenue general and administrative of revenue charge for purchased research and development of revenue other acquisition costs  including amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles of revenue restructuring costs n a of revenue customer service and technical support 
customer service and technical support expenses decreased to of revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal these improvements reflect the continuing benefit from cost reductions resulting from the restructuring and consolidation of our technical support facilities in the united states and europe in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  certain costs that were categorized as customer service and technical support costs in fiscal are reflected in fiscal as cost of sales for our expanding fee for support programs 
we have also benefited from our efforts to provide customer service and technical support less expensively through websites and other electronic means 
during our peak season in the second and third quarters of fiscal  many customers experienced unusually long hold times for customer service calls 
we may need to increase customer service and technical support expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal  in order to improve customer service levels and also to handle customer questions relating to year compliance issues 
in addition  during july  due to site performance issues  customers were unable to access the portfolio tracking features on the quicken 
com site for several days 
if we experience product errors  poor service levels or additional service outages for our web based products  it may result in significant additional customer service and technical support expenses and or customer dissatisfaction 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  customer service and technical support expenses decreased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal this was primarily the result of cost reductions achieved from the restructuring and consolidation of our technical support facilities in the united states and europe in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to of revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal fiscal selling and marketing expenses included a million charge for the aol agreement entered into in february excluding this charge  selling and marketing expenses would have been of revenue for fiscal the fiscal decrease  net of the aol charge  is primarily the result of our acquisition of lacerte  which experiences comparatively lower selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
this positive impact from lacerte was partially offset by increased television and radio advertising for our quicken product line and additional costs related to the promotion of quickbooks  our internet based products and services  and the quickbooks online payroll service launch 
we expect that selling and marketing expenses will increase as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our promotion of internet based initiatives and increased competition due to microsoft s expected entry into the personal tax market 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  selling and marketing expenses increased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase was due to the million aol charge 
excluding the aol charge  selling and marketing expenses would have been roughly flat for fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to of revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease is due in part to our acquisition of lacerte which experiences comparatively lower research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue 
the positive impact of the lacerte results were partially offset by increased development expenses for our internet related initiatives 
we expect our internet based businesses will continue to result in significant development expenses in fiscal if such expenses exceed our current expectations  they may have an adverse effect on our operating results 
this could occur  for example  if we were to undertake a costly product development venture in response to competitive pressures or other market conditions 
excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  research and development expenses increased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the development of the multi user version of quickbooks contributed to these increasing costs since it was more expensive to develop than our less complex single user products 
increases were also a result of our increased spending to improve and expand our internet products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to of revenue for fiscal compared to of revenue for fiscal excluding the operating results of our divested parsons subsidiary for fiscal  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal other acquisition costs 
other acquisition costs include the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles that are recorded as part of an acquisition 
these costs increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase for fiscal reflects additional amortization resulting from our acquisition of lacerte in june and the acquisition of cri in may we also incurred a million charge relating to lacerte s in process research and development in fiscal and million in process charges for our acquisition of galt technologies in fiscal in connection with our acquisition of lacerte  we used a third party appraiser s estimate to determine the value of two in process projects under development for which technological feasibility had not been established 
these projects were identified for products being developed under separate operating systems dos and windows 
the value of the projects was determined by estimating the costs to develop the in process technology into commercially feasible products  estimating the net cash flows we believed would result from the products and discounting these net cash flows back to their present value 
both projects were released on schedule and actual results to date have been consistent with assumptions made when we initially appraised the value of these in process projects 
specifically  revenues  development costs and completion dates as they relate to the two projects were consistent with our expectations 
based on a third party s appraisal of our cri acquisition  there were no values assigned to in process projects under development  so there were no up front charges for in process research and development in fiscal relating to the cri acquisition 
the high levels of non cash amortization expense related to completed acquisitions will continue to have a negative impact on operating results in future periods 
as of july   and assuming no additional acquisitions and no impairment of value resulting in an acceleration of amortization  future amortization will reduce net income by approximately million  million and million for the years ending july  through  respectively 
we expect these expenses to increase as a result of acquisitions completed after july  see note 
if we complete additional acquisitions or accelerate amortization in the future  there would be an incremental negative impact on operating expenses 
other income and expense  net for fiscal  interest and other income and expense  net  increased to million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal this reflects increased cash and short term investment balances over those periods 
interest earned on customer payroll deposits is reported as revenue and is not included in other income 
the million gain on disposal of business in fiscal resulted from the sale of parsons  our direct marketing subsidiary  in august our million pre tax gain from marketable securities in fiscal was primarily the result of our sales of excite  verisign and concentric common stock and the gain from converting our excite common stock to excite home 
we have elected to report our converted excite home common stock as a trading security 
as a result  market fluctuations are marked to market and reported in our earnings 
if we were to experience a significant decline in these securities  there could be a negative impact on our earnings see note 
income taxes for fiscal  we recorded an income tax provision of million on pretax income of million resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 
this compares to income tax provisions benefit of and million on pretax income loss of and million for the same periods of the prior years 
at july   there was a valuation allowance of million for tax assets of our international subsidiaries based on management s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources at july   our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a million increase from july  our operations provided million in cash during the twelve months ended july  primary contributors to cash provided were net income adjusted for non cash expenses such as acquisition charges and depreciation as well as a significant increase in accrued liabilities 
the increase in liabilities was driven primarily by increased income taxes payable from our realized gains on the disposition of marketable securities 
we also experienced increased liabilities due to increased reserves for rebates and returns resulting from the overall growth in revenues not only when comparing fiscal to fiscal  but also when comparing the strong revenue growth of the last two quarters of fiscal to fiscal partially offsetting the contributors to cash was the increase in prepaid and other assets due in part to tax prepayments and short term loans 
investing activities provided million in cash for the twelve months ended july  the primary source of cash was from our sale of million shares of our investment in excite  primarily during the fourth quarter of  which provided million 
additional sources of cash were from the sale of investments in checkfree  verisign  and concentric from which we had proceeds of million  million  and million 
our sources of cash were partially offset by a number of acquisitions during the year 
our acquisition of cri was partially funded in fiscal by the payment of million in cash 
we also acquired customer lists and intellectual property rights of taxbyte  inc and compucraft tax services  llc  for million and million 
we also completed a million equity investment in security first technologies 
other uses of cash included net purchases of both short and long term investments for million and purchases of property and equipment for million 
capital expenditures are primarily for equipment and facilities to support our ongoing and expanding operations and information systems 
we currently hold investments in a number of publicly traded companies see note 
the volatility of the stock market and the potential risk of fluctuating stock prices may have an impact on our future liquidity 
for example  prior to year end  we experienced a decline in the market value of our remaining investment in excite home 
due to our reporting of the excite home shares as a trading security  future fluctuations in the carrying value of excite home will impact our earnings see note 
if future declines in our other marketable securities are deemed to be permanent  they will also impact our earnings 
financing activities provided million in cash for fiscal attributable to proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
in connection with our acquisition of cri see note  we are required to pay three annual installments of million in each of the next three fiscal years 
in the normal course of business  we enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and international locations 
see note and the properties section of the business section page for more information on lease commitments 
we also evaluate the merits of acquiring technology or businesses  or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies 
accordingly  it is possible that we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future 
for example  if we exercise our option to purchase vfsc see note and elect to pay all or a significant portion of the exercise price in cash  this would have a negative impact on our liquidity 
we believe that our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year intuit has established a year project office to address the impact of the year date transition on its operations  products and services globally 
in  we established this office to coordinate a number of existing projects and put in place a formal  structured year process moving forward 
the project office has a dedicated program manager who reports directly to intuit s senior management  and status is reported regularly to the audit committee of intuit s board of directors 
we have adopted a five phase approach that we believe follows standard industry practices for reviewing and preparing the significant elements of operations  products and services for the year date transition 
phase one initiation involves increasing company awareness by educating and involving all appropriate levels of management regarding the need to address year issues 
phase two inventory consists of identifying all of our systems  products and relationships that may be impacted by year phase three assessment involves determining our current state of year readiness for those areas identified in the inventory phase and prioritizing areas that need to be fixed 
phase four action consists of developing year solutions where required  and completing a comprehensive test cycle for all appropriate inventoried items 
phase five implementation consists of rolling out year solutions for affected products  services and technologies and implementing maintenance and support processes to maintain ongoing compliance 
as a software developer  we have three key areas of focus our products and services  our internal systems including information technology systems such as financial and order entry systems and non information technology systems such as phones and facilities  and the readiness of third parties with whom we have significant business relationships 
the majority of our efforts in the product area have now completed the action phase and our efforts are primarily focused on providing our customer base with confirmation of product compliance and remediation options  where required 
customers can find intuit s year readiness disclosure about our products  and order free solutions  where required  on our corporate year website at www 
intuit 
com yk 
the remediation and implementation efforts for the majority of our internal systems were substantially completed during fiscal as most companies are experiencing  there is now an on going maintenance effort required to review the compliance statements of our vendors and to verify that our technology remains compliant 
we will continue to work with our third party vendors to review the status of their efforts and have dedicated considerable time and effort on testing activities with our key vendors 
costs directly attributed to our year project were approximately million in fiscal this estimate is comprised primarily of hardware  software  internal resources and consulting fees necessary for our year testing activities during fiscal we currently anticipate direct costs in the range of to million for fiscal year  resulting from the completion of the project phases and the transition into an ongoing maintenance and support activity in fiscal year we believe that the nature of our products and the size and profile of our customer base is likely to lead to a significant increase in the calls to our customer support centers throughout the remainder of calendar and early these support operations may experience call volumes not experienced to date and we are developing plans that should allow us to handle the anticipated increase in calls in a manner that will not lead to material incremental costs 
additionally  there will be costs associated with the manufacture and distribution of free solutions for products that are not year compliant or in certain cases that will not be tested for year compliance 
we believe the provision of free solutions may result in lost revenue for new product upgrades to within a range of to million  although the exact amount will depend on customer response to the year issue 
in an effort to reduce the risks associated with the year  we have incorporated contingency planning as part of our five phase plan  building upon disaster recovery and contingency planning that we already have in place 
this includes identifying areas where we are most vulnerable to year risk and putting contingency plans in place before we experience potential failures 
despite our efforts  we may not anticipate or adequately provide for all contingencies 
while we are dedicating substantial resources toward attaining year readiness  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to address year issues 
if we are not successful  there could be significant adverse effects on our operations 
for example  failure to achieve year readiness for our internal systems could delay our ability to manufacture and ship products  disrupt our customer service and technical support facilities  or interrupt customer access to our online products and services 
if our products are not year ready  we could suffer lost sales or other negative consequences resulting from customer dissatisfaction  including additional litigation see discussion below 
we also rely heavily on third parties such as manufacturing suppliers  service providers  financial institutions and a large retail distribution channel 
if these or other third parties experience year failures or malfunctions  there could be a material negative impact on our ability to conduct ongoing operations 
many of our products are significantly interconnected with heavily regulated financial institutions 
our relationships with financial institutions could be adversely impacted if we do not achieve year readiness in a manner and on a time schedule that permits them to comply with regulatory requirements 
we may also incur additional costs if we are required to accelerate our year readiness to meet financial institution requirements 
as with all companies  we also rely on other more widely used entities such as government agencies  public utilities and other external forces common to business and industry 
consequently  if such entities were to experience year failures  this could disrupt our ability to conduct ongoing operations 
several class action lawsuits have been filed against intuit in california and new york  alleging year issues with the online banking functionality in certain versions of our quicken products  and it is possible that we will face additional lawsuits 
we do not believe the pending lawsuits have merit and intend to defend them vigorously 
we have been working with financial institutions to provide solutions to their current online banking customers and are planning to make such solutions available before customers experience any year problems 
see legal proceedings for more information about this litigation 
the above discussion regarding costs  risks and estimated completion dates for the year is based on our best estimates given information that is currently available  and is subject to change 
as we continue to progress with this initiative  we may discover that actual results will differ materially from these estimates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of instruments that meet high quality standards consistent with our investment policy 
this policy dictates that we diversify our holdings and limit our short term investments to a maximum of million to any one issuer 
our policy also dictates that all short term investments mature in months or less 
principal amounts by expected maturity in thousands  except interest rates fair years ending july  value july  total cash equivalents    average interest rate investments      average interest rate total portfolio      average interest rate marketable securities we also carry significant balances in marketable equity securities as of july  these securities are subject to considerable market risk due to their volatility 
fluctuations in the carrying value of our shares of excite home will impact our earnings because we report these shares as trading security 
see note of the financial statement notes for more information regarding risks related to our investments in marketable securities and note for information regarding the impact of our excite home common stock on reported net income 
impact of foreign currency rate changes during fiscal  the currency of our japanese subsidiary has strengthened while the currencies of our other subsidiaries have remained essentially stable since the end of our fiscal year 
because we translate foreign currencies into u 
s dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
for the fiscal year end  there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
currency exchange risk is also minimized since foreign debt is due almost exclusively in local foreign currencies 
as of july   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
