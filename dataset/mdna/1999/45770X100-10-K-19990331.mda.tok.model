year readiness disclosure statement many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
mathsoft is in the process of evaluating and correcting the year compliance of its proprietary products and services and third party equipment and software that it uses  as well as its non information technology systems  such as building security  voice mail and other systems

the company s expectations regarding year remediation efforts will evolve as it continues to analyze and correct its systems 
the company has not yet developed a formal year specific contingency plan

failure by the company to resolve year issues with respect to its products and services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operation and financial condition 
furthermore  failure of third party equipment or software to operate properly with regards to the year and thereafter could require mathsoft to incur significant unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems
