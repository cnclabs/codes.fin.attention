item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results compared with sales declined slightly in to billion from billion in as an electronics manufacturing services provider  the company s sales are affected by shifts in customers market shares and product changeovers 
certain of these shifts and product changeovers  together with declining average selling prices  accounted for lower sales in domestic sales declined in as a result of these factors and manufacturing contract transfers by customers to lower cost foreign operations 
declining average selling prices are expected to continue during fiscal finished product sales continue to represent approximately of the company sales 
such sales inherently carry lower operating margins than subassembly level products 
this lower operating margin is offset by higher associated asset turnovers 
sales of the company s foreign operations increased to of total sales from in foreign sales ratio is expected to continue to increase as demand for lower cost foreign manufacturing persists 
growth in foreign sales also affects average selling prices because of their generally lower manufacturing costs 
foreign sales grew  especially in europe and mexico 
europe s sales growth benefitted from the acquisitions of scandinavian facilities in may  and a spanish facility in october  together with the first full year production of a plant in the netherlands and maturing of the hungarian plant 
mexico s sales growth mainly resulted from expanded capacity installed during the year 
further capacity expansions in canada  hungary  mexico  and the netherlands are planned for operating margins declined to in compared with in this decline resulted primarily from startup and transition costs of new and enlarged facilities and

projects  industry price pressures  and increased foreign currency exchange losses 
brazil s currency devaluations affected product pricing and business volumes 
the company uses the us dollar as the functional currency for its brazilian operation since the major expenditures for that operation are transacted in dollars 
the brazilian economy is believed to be stabilizing and the sci brazilian operation s performance is expected to improve 
net interest expense declined in mainly because of lower borrowing requirements and the conversion of outstanding convertible notes in may reduced interest expense resulting from the conversion had no effect on diluted earnings per share as it is added back for this per share calculation 
net interest expense is expected to increase in because of forecast increased use of credit lines for planned growth 
interest income netted against interest expense was earned from temporary cash investments 
interest income declined because of reduced amounts of short term investments 
increased amounts of lower taxed foreign earnings accounted for the reduced effective income tax rate in in compared with in 
the company has fully provided for us income taxes on that portion of foreign earnings it does not consider permanently invested 
the effective income tax rate may decline somewhat in the future if lower taxed foreign earnings become a greater percentage of taxable income as forecast 
net income decreased as a percentage of sales in in compared with in mainly as a result of lower operating margins 
capital resources and liquidity working capital at june   increased to million from million at june  this change primarily resulted from increased accounts receivable and inventories in support of larger quarterly revenues 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased as well 
other current assets increased primarily because of additional recoverable foreign value added taxes vat resulting from larger foreign sales 
current ratio declined modestly to at june   from a year earlier 
available liquidity at june   was million  supplied by million in unused credit facilities and million in cash 
lower liquidity is expected in fiscal as anticipated acquisitions and internal growth utilize funds 
with shareholders equity now exceeding billion  additional financing is believed to be available to the company as needed 
accordingly  the company believes it can adequately fund its expected growth in the intermediate term 
capital expenditures decreased in from the level as revenues stabilized 
capital expenditures are expected to substantially increase in fiscal as the company expands acquisition and building activity 
capital expenditures could exceed million under existing plans 
changes in market conditions and acquisition opportunities can impact actual capital expenditures substantially 
the august   acquisition of nortel networks brockville plant and manufacturing assets was funded with existing liquidity 
other noncurrent assets increased somewhat due to increased goodwill and deferred compensation investments other than the company common stock held in rabbi trusts 
the company common stock held in rabbi trusts is shown as a reduction to shareholders equity beginning in fiscal in accordance with eitf year readiness the year compliance issue refers to a condition in computer software where a two digit field rather than a four digit field is used to distinguish a calendar year 
unless corrected  some computer programs may not function on january  and thereafter until corrected  as they will be unable to distinguish the correct date 
such an uncorrected condition could significantly impact the company  possibly resulting in disruption to its operations  and possibly subjecting it to legal liabilities 
the company has updated much of its existing software for year compliance by acquiring new or upgraded third party software packages  and by modifying existing internally developed software 
the company has tested all significant software for year readiness and expects to have all such software compliant  tested  and installed by the end of october the company believes it has sufficiently reduced mechanical equipment microcontroller year exposure through substantial compliant equipment additions or replacements 
the possibility exists  however  that the company may fail to correct an internal year issue in its software or manufacturing equipment 
the company believes this possibility would not significantly impact its operations  as it should be able to effectively conduct its business using year compliant software and equipment currently installed 
based on inquiries to date  the company believes satisfactory progress has been made by its major vendors and customers on year readiness 
the major exposure to the company with year readiness is believed to be the status of utility providers  especially in foreign countries 
not only could the company s production be disrupted if one of its utility providers fails to be fully year ready  but also indirectly if a parts supplier s utility provider is not year ready 
a prolonged utility outage could significantly adversely affect the company until production is shifted to other facilities or to suppliers not impacted by utility outages

to date  year readiness cost to the company has been approximately million including upgrades to existing systems 
results compared with sales in increased to billion from the billion level of a year earlier 
in spite of the effects of continued rapid declines of average selling prices  liquidation of excess customer distribution channel inventories  and essentially a full year of asian economic turmoil  net revenues grew 
outsourcing of manufacturing services continued to gain momentum 
finished product sales accounted for approximately of sales

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk short term interest rate changes can impact the company s interest expense on its variable interest rate debt  as well as the discount reflected as interest expense on its accounts receivable sold under an asset securitization agreement 
variable interest rate debt of less than million was outstanding at june  no amounts were sold under the asset securitization agreement at june  accordingly  a change in short term interest rates would currently have a minor impact on the company 
in the future  the company expects changing interest rates to have a greater impact 
increased use of the asset securitization agreement and borrowings is expected to finance anticipated growth 
the company predominantly conducts its foreign sales and purchase transactions in us dollars or under customer contract provisions that protect against most major currency risks 
the largest currency risk at june   was that associated with brazilian operations 
unlike most other foreign operations of sci  this plant is directly subjected to the effects of currency devaluation on certain customers contracts until forward pricing is adjusted accordingly normally monthly 
during fiscal the brazilian currency experienced severe devaluations 
this devaluation adversely impacted the results of the brazilian operation 
at june   the company had approximately million of net current assets and million of long term intercompany advances subject to this currency exposure 
approximately million of inventory is subject to repricing arrangements for currency fluctuations 
the company considers the brazilian economic outlook  while improving  too uncertain to predict 
other currency exchange risks primarily relate to current assets and liabilities denominated in other than the us dollar 
the company endeavors to balance such items against each other where possible at individual operations 
accordingly  the company does not believe the effects of changes in currency exchange rates upon such non us dollar transactions would be material 
changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates impact the geographic areas where the company s revenue is derived 
when foreign currencies are devalued  manufacturing costs of plants in those countries may become more competitive with domestic plants 
the company  when it believes it advisable  may enter into hedge contracts to reduce its currency risks on known transactions 
additionally  when deemed advantageous  the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to adjust the interest rate on existing debt 
the company has not entered into speculative interest or currency agreements  and it does not plan to do so
