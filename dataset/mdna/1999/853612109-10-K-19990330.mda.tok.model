general smc acquired shelby life on november   savers life on march  and midwestern life on october  these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  these subsidiaries are included in the smc consolidated financial statements commencing with their respective acquisition effective dates 
product profitability 
margins on life insurance and annuity products are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
rising interest rates would result in a decline in the market value of assets 
however  as there are positive cash flows from renewal premiums  investment income and maturities of existing assets  the need for early disposition of investment assets to meet operating cash flow requirements would be unlikely 
rising interest rates would also result in available cash flows from maturities being invested at higher interest rates  which would help support a gradual increase in new business and renewal interest rates on interest sensitive products 
a sharp  sudden rise in the interest rate environment without a concurrent increase in crediting rates could result in higher surrenders  particularly for annuities 
the effect of surrenders would be to reduce earnings over the long term 
earnings in the period of the surrender could increase or decrease depending on whether surrender charges were applicable and whether such charges differed from the write off of related deferred acquisition costs or present value of future profits 
when interest rates fall  smc generally attempts to adjust the credited interest rates subject to competitive pressures 
although smc believes that such strategies will continue to permit it to achieve a positive spread  a significant decline in the yield on smc s investments could adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of smc 
purchased insurance business 
in accordance with industry practice  when smc purchases additional insurance business  it assigns a portion of the purchase price  called the present value of future profits  to the right to receive future cash flows arising from existing insurance policies 
this asset is recorded when the business is purchased at the value of projected future cash flows on existing policies  less a discount to present value 
as future cash flows emerge  they are treated as a recovery of this asset 
therefore  if cash flows emerging from the purchased or recaptured business during a period exactly equal the projections  they are offset by that period s amortization of the cost of the policies purchased 
in that event  the only income statement effect from the purchased business is the realization of the discount that was initially deducted from the asset to reflect its present value 
changes in the future annual amortization of this asset are not expected to have a significant effect on the results of operations  because the amount of amortization is expected to be equal to the profits emerging from the purchased policies  net of interest on the unrecovered present value of future profits balance 
this asset is amortized over the expected life of the related policies purchased 
present value of future profits is increased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment losses and decreased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment gains 
in selecting the interest rate to calculate the discounted present value of the projected future profits  smc uses the risk rate of return it needs to earn in order to invest in the business being acquired or recaptured 
in determining this required risk rate of return  smc considers the following factors the magnitude of the risks associated with each of the actuarial assumptions used in determining expected future cash flows as described above 
the cost of the capital required to fund the acquisition or recapture 
the likelihood of changes in projected future cash flows that might occur if there are changes in insurance regulations and tax laws 
the acquired company s compatibility with other smc activities that may favorably affect future cash flows 
the complexity of the acquired company or recaptured business 
recent prices ie  discount rates used in determining valuations paid by others to acquire or recapture similar blocks of business 
the discount rate selected may affect subsequent earnings in those instances where the purchase price of the policies exceeds the value of net assets acquired including the value of future profits discounted at the selected interest rate 
selection of a lower or higher discount rate will increase or decrease the portion of the purchase price assigned to the present value of future cash flows and will result in an offsetting decrease or increase in the amount of the purchase price assigned to goodwill 
the effect on subsequent earnings caused by this variation in purchase price allocation will depend on the characteristics of the policies purchased 
for products where the profits emerge at relatively constant levels over an extended period of time for example  most of smc s immediate and deferred annuities  use of a lower rate may result in an increase in reported earnings in the early years after an acquisition followed by a decrease in earnings in later years 
for products where profits emerge over a shorter period of time or in amounts that decrease over the life of the product for example  ordinary and term life products  selection of a lower rate will generally result in a decrease in reported earnings in the early years after an acquisition followed by an increase in reported earnings in later years 
for smc  the majority of the cost of policies purchased relates to ordinary life products and the balance to deferred annuity products 
the percentage of future expected net amortization of the beginning balance of the present value of future profits before the effect of net unrealized gains and losses  based on the present value of future profits at december  and current assumptions as to future events on all policies in force  will be between and in each of the years through smc used a discount rate to calculate the present value of future profits on business of the savers life and midwestern life acquisitions 
each is being amortized over years based on the mix of their respective annuity and life business 
for more information related to purchased insurance business refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
produced insurance business 
insurance products generate two types of profit streams i from the excess of investment income earned over that credited to the policyholder and ii from the excess of premiums received over costs incurred for policy issuance  administration and mortality 
costs incurred in issuing new policies are deferred and recorded as deferred acquisition costs dac  which are amortized using present value techniques so that profits are realized in proportion to premium revenue for certain products and estimated gross profits for certain other products 
profits from all of these elements are recognized over the lives of the policies  no profits are recorded at the time the policies are issued 
amortization of dac was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in current year amortization expense resulted primarily from increased amortization of dac as gross profits from business sold in recent years began to emerge 
dac is generally amortized over the expected lives of the policies  a period of approximately years  in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 
interest is being accreted at the projected crediting rate on the policies  during year one  in year two  in year three and thereafter 
dac is increased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment losses and decreased for the estimated effect of realizing unrealized investment gains 
the offset to these amounts is recorded directly to shareholders equity  net of taxes 
future expected amortization of dac for the next five years before the effect of net realized and unrealized gains and losses  based on dac at december  and current assumptions  is as follows in thousands gross amortization      interest accreted   net amortization      the amounts included in the foregoing table do not include any amortization of dac resulting from the sale of new products after december  any changes in future annual amortization of this asset are not expected to have a significant effect on results of operations because the amount of amortization is expected to be proportionate to the profits from the produced policies  net of interest on dac 
variances between actual and expected profits 
actual experience on purchased and produced insurance may vary from projections due to differences in renewal premiums collected  investment spreads  mortality costs  persistency  administrative costs and other factors 
variances from original projections  whether positive or negative  are included in net income as they occur 
to the extent that these variances indicate that future experience will differ from the estimated profits reflected in the capitalization and amortization of the cost of policies purchased or the cost of policies produced  current and future amortization rates may be adjusted 
accounting for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life products 
the company primarily accounts for its annuity  universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses on the sale of investments 
under sfas no 
 a benefit reserve is established at the time of policy issuance in an amount equal to the deposits received 
thereafter  the benefit reserve is adjusted for any additional deposits  interest credited and partial or complete withdrawals 
revenues for annuities and universal and interest sensitive life policies  other than certain non interest sensitive annuities  consist of policy charges for surrenders and partial withdrawals  mortality and administration  and investment income earned 
such revenues do not include the annuity  universal and interest sensitive life policy deposits 
expenses related to these products include interest credited to policyowner account balances  operating costs for policy administration  amortization of dac and mortality costs in excess of account balances 
costs relating to the acquisition of new business  primarily commissions paid to agents  which vary with and are directly related to the production of new business  are deferred to the extent that such costs are recoverable from future profit margins 
at the time of issuance  the acquisition expenses  approximately of initial annuity premium deposits and of premiums from universal and interest sensitive life products for smc  are capitalized as dac 
in accordance with sfas no 
 dac with interest is amortized over the lives of the policies in a constant relationship to the present value of estimated future gross profits 
unit linked product accounting 
separate account assets and liabilities are maintained primarily for contracts of which the majority represents unit linked products where benefits on surrender and maturity are not guaranteed 
they generally represent funds held in accounts to meet specific investment objectives of policyholders who bear the investment risk 
investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to such policyholders 
smc earns income from the investment management fee it charges on such unit linked contracts  which ranges from 
to of the value of the underlying separate accounts 
in addition  on certain contracts  smc can potentially earn up to a initiation fee on new business sold 
results of operations by segment for the three years ended december  the following tables and narratives summarize the results of our operations by business segment

the percentage increase in operating earnings was greater than the percentage increase in operating earnings per diluted share primarily because of the increase in weighted average diluted common shares or equivalents outstanding during the period 
this increase in weighted average shares outstanding resulted primarily from issued shares in connection with the acquisitions of savers life and midwestern life 
smc s operating earnings were million  or cents per diluted share  up and  respectively over operating earnings increased as a result of i increased spread revenues due to an increase in weighted average insurance liabilities primarily due to the inclusion of shelby life operations  ii a nonproportional increase in operating expenses relative to the increase in weighted average insurance liabilities  iii fees from administration contracts  and iv decreased premium deficiency reserves

a change in premium deposits in a single period does not directly cause operating income to change  although continued increases or decreases in premiums may affect the growth rate of total assets on which investment spreads are earned 
policy income policy income represents mortality charges  administrative fees and surrender charges 
during policy income increased million or to million 
the increase relates to 
million of surrender charges on certain fpda products of standard life which is primarily the result of lowering credited rates on those products

throughout the company s history  it has experienced both periods of higher and lower benefit claims 
such volatility is not uncommon in the life insurance industry and  over extended periods of time  periods of higher claim experience tend to offset periods of lower claims experience 
health benefits and claims in include million of medicare supplement benefits incurred from march   the acquisition date of savers life through july   the effective date of the sale of the medicare supplement block of business 
life benefits and claims in declined million or  to million due to i an increase in future policy reserves of million in related to the termination and recapture of the reinsurance agreement with national mutual

the impact of these translations have not been quantified on individual components 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity of standard management parent company standard management is a financial services holding company whose liquidity requirements are met through payments received from its subsidiaries 
these payments include i interest on surplus debenture  ii dividends  iii management fees and iv rental income  which are subject to restrictions under applicable insurance laws and are used to pay operating expenses and meet debt service obligations 
these internal sources of liquidity have been supplemented in the past by external sources such as a revolving credit agreements and long term debt and equity financing in the capital markets 
general on a consolidated gaap basis smc reported net cash provided by operations of 
million and million for and  respectively 
although deposits received on smc s interest sensitive annuities and other financial products are not included in cash flow from operations under gaap  such funds are available for use by smc 
cash provided by operations plus net deposits received  less net account balances returned to policyholders on interest sensitive annuities and other financial products  resulted in positive cash flow of million and million for and  respectively 
cash generated on a consolidated basis is available to standard management only to the extent that it is generated at the standard management level or is available through dividends  interest  management fees or other payments from subsidiaries 
smc instituted a program to repurchase its common stock in order to increase the market value of the stock 
at december   standard management is authorized to repurchase million additional shares of smc common stock under this program 
at february   standard management had parent company only cash and short term investments of 
million 
these funds are available to standard management for general corporate purposes 
standard management s parent company only operating expenses not including interest expense were million and million for and  respectively

standard management currently anticipates these quarterly approvals will be granted 
assuming the approvals are granted and the december  interest rate of continues  standard management will receive interest income of million from the surplus debenture in dividends 
dividends from standard life to standard management are limited by laws applicable to insurance companies 
as an indiana domiciled insurance company  standard life may pay a dividend or distribution from its surplus profits  without the prior approval of the commissioner of the indiana department of insurance  if the dividend or distribution  together with all other dividends and distributions paid within the preceding twelve months  does not exceed the greater of i net gain from operations or ii of surplus  in each case as shown in its preceding annual statutory financial statements 
in  standard life can pay dividends of approximately million without regulatory approval 
management fees 
pursuant to a management services agreement  standard life paid standard management million during and million during for certain management services related to the production of business  investment of assets and evaluation of acquisitions 
prior to its merger into standard life  savers life paid standard management 
million during for certain management services pursuant to a management services agreement 
in addition  dixie life paid standard life million during and million during for certain management services provided 
both of these agreements provide that they may be modified or terminated by the indiana and mississippi departments of insurance in the event of financial hardship of standard life or dixie life 
pursuant to the management services agreement  premier life luxembourg paid standard management 
million during and for certain management and administrative services 
the agreement provides that it may be modified or terminated by either standard management or premier life luxembourg 
equipment rental fees 
in and  standard management charged subsidiaries million per year for the use of equipment owned by standard management 
liquidity of insurance operations us insurance operations 
the principal liquidity requirements of standard life are its contractual obligations to policyholders  dividend  rent  management fee and surplus debenture payments to standard management and other operating expenses 
the primary source of funding for these obligations has been cash flow from premium income  net investment income  investment sales and maturities and sales of fpdas 
these sources of liquidity for standard life significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits and policy withdrawals and surrenders 
the amount of withdrawals and surrenders is affected by a variety of factors such as renewal interest crediting rates  interest rates for competing products  general economic conditions  standard life s am best ratings currently rated b and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
the policies and annuities issued by standard life contain provisions that allow policyholders to withdraw or surrender their policies under defined circumstances 
these policies and annuities generally contain provisions which apply penalties or otherwise restrict the ability of policyholders to make such withdrawals or surrenders 
standard life closely monitors the surrender and policy loan activity of its insurance products and manages the composition of its investment portfolios  including liquidity  in light of such activity 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and other withdrawals 
in addition to the potential effect on liquidity  unanticipated withdrawals in a changing interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if smc were required to sell investments at reduced values to meet liquidity demands 
smc manages the asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings effect of changing market interest rates 
smc seeks assets that have duration characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
smc also prepares cash flow projections and performs cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy 
smc s us insurance subsidiaries currently expect available liquidity sources and future cash flows to be adequate to meet the demand for funds 
statutory surplus is computed according to rules prescribed by the naic  as modified by the indiana department of insurance  or the state in which the insurance subsidiaries do business 
statutory accounting rules are different from gaap and are intended to reflect a more conservative perspective 
with respect to new business  statutory accounting practices require that i acquisition costs primarily commissions and policy issue costs and ii reserves for future guaranteed principal payments and interest in excess of statutory rates  be expensed in the year the new business is written 
these items cause a reduction in statutory surplus surplus strain in the year written for many insurance products 
smc designs its products to minimize such first year losses  but certain products continue to cause a statutory loss in the year written 
for each product  smc controls the amount of net new premiums written to manage the effect of such surplus strain 
smc s long term growth goals contemplate continued growth in its insurance businesses 
to achieve these growth goals  smc s us insurance subsidiaries will need to increase statutory surplus 
additional statutory surplus may be secured through various sources such as internally generated statutory earnings  infusions by standard management with funds generated through debt or equity offerings or mergers with other life insurance companies 
if additional capital is not available from one or more of these sources  smc believes that it could reduce surplus strain through the use of reinsurance or through reduced writing of new business 
management believes that the operational cash flow of standard life will be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for as of december   standard life had statutory capital and surplus for regulatory purposes of million compared to million at december  the increase is primarily due to the issuance of million of surplus debentures in connection with the merger of midwestern life and savers life into standard life 
the remaining increase is primarily due to net gain from operations of standard life of million 
as the life insurance and annuity business produced by standard life increases  standard life expects to continue to satisfy statutory capital and surplus requirements through statutory profits  through the continued reinsurance of a portion of its new business  and through additional capital contributions by standard management 
net cash flow from operations on a statutory basis of standard life  after payment of benefits and operating expenses  was million and million for and  respectively 
if the need arises for cash which is not readily available  additional liquidity could be obtained from the sale of invested assets 
effective january  the company decided to no longer sell new business through dixie life 
all new business will instead be sold through standard life 
this decision is not expected to have a material effect on operations or financial condition of the company 
international operations 
smi dividends are limited to its accumulated earnings without regulatory approval 
smi and premier life luxembourg were not permitted to pay dividends in and due to accumulated losses 
premier life bermuda did not pay dividends in and smc does not anticipate any dividends from these companies in factors that may affect future results mergers  acquisitions and consolidations 
the us insurance industry is experiencing an increasing number of mergers  acquisitions  consolidations and sales of certain business lines 
these consolidations are largely the result of the following the need to reduce costs of distribution and overhead  the need to maintain business in force  increased competition  regulatory capital requirements  and technology costs 
smc expects this trend to continue 
foreign currency risk 
smi policyholders invest in assets denominated in a wide range of currencies 
as policyholders are not permitted to invest directly in options  futures and derivatives  their investment and currency risk is limited to premiums they have paid 
although policyholders effectively bear the currency risk  smi could be exposed to currency fluctuations if currencies within the conventional investment portfolio or certain actuarial reserves are mismatched 
in order to minimize this risk  smi continually matches the assets and liabilities of the portfolio and the reserves 
in addition  premier life luxembourg shareholder s equity is denominated in luxembourg francs 
premier life luxembourg does not hedge currency risk because its shareholder s equity will remain in luxembourg francs for the foreseeable future  thus  no significant realized foreign exchange gains or losses are anticipated 
at december   there was an immaterial unrealized loss from foreign currency 
euro currency 
effective january   the eleven participating european member union countries established fixed conversion rates between their legal currencies and the euro 
the legal currencies in those countries will continue to be used as legal tender through january  subsequent to this date  the legal currencies will be canceled and euro bills and coins will be used for cash transactions in the participating countries 
during this three year dual currency environment  conversion rates between the legal currencies will no longer be computed directly between one another 
instead  a special triangulation procedure must be followed by first converting one legal currency into its euro equivalent and then converting the euro equivalent into the other legal currency 
although the company has not initiated an analysis plan for the euro conversion  smc does not expect it to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition 
possibility of future dilution of ownership and voting power 
the smc board of directors has the authority to issue up to 
million additional shares of preferred stock and million additional shares of common stock 
the board s authority under smc s charter typically does not require stockholder approval unless it is otherwise required for a particular transaction 
although smc is not currently involved in any life insurance acquisitions  the company regularly investigates such opportunities and could issue additional shares of smc common or preferred stock in connection with an acquisition 
uncertainties regarding intangible assets 
included in smc s december  financial statements are certain assets that are primarily valued  for financial statement purposes  on the basis of management assumptions 
these assets include items such as deferred acquisition costs  present value of future profits  costs in excess of net assets acquired  and organization and deferred debt issuance costs 
the value of these assets reflected in the december  balance sheet total million or of smc s assets 
smc has established procedures to periodically review the assumptions used to value these assets and determine the need to make adjustments of such values in smc s consolidated financial statements 
smc has determined that the assumptions used in the initial valuation of the assets are consistent with the current operations of smc as of december  regulatory environment 
currently  prescribed or permitted statutory accounting principles sap may vary between states and between companies 
the naic is in the process of codifying sap to promote standardization of methods utilized throughout the industry 
completion of this project might result in changes in statutory accounting practices for smc s insurance subsidiaries  however  it is not expected that such changes would materially affect smc s insurance subsidiaries statutory capital requirements 
financial services deregulation 
the united states congress is currently considering a number of legislative proposals intended to reduce or eliminate restrictions on affiliations among financial services organizations 
proposals are extant which would allow banks to own or affiliate with insurers and securities firms 
an increased presence of banks in the life insurance and annuity businesses may increase competition in these markets 
the company cannot predict the impact of these proposals on the earnings of the company 
impact of year the company updated its main operating computer systems in with year ready systems at a cost of 
million 
since that time the company has completed modifications or conversions of other portions of its software  hardware and imbedded chip technology so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company believes that with such modifications and conversions  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the total cost of the year project is 
million including the 
million previously discussed 
these costs are not material to the company s financial statements and were funded through operating cash flows 
the company is currently assessing the risks associated with their external business relationships  including those with agents and financial institutions 
the company has been informed by approximately of their external business partners that they are or will be year ready sometime in the company is still accumulating data from the remaining business partners  which it hopes to have concluded by mid the company also assessed what contingency plans will be needed  if any  of its critical systems or those of external business relationships that are not year ready after december  the company does not currently anticipate such a situation  but the consideration of a contingency plan will continue to evolve as new information becomes available 
the failure to correct a year problem could result in an interruption  or failure of  a number of normal business activities or operations 
however  management has concluded that the year issue will not materially affect future financial results  or cause reported financial information to be nonindicative of future operating results or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to invest available funds in a manner that will maximize shareholder value and fund future obligations to policyholders and debtors  subject to appropriate risk considerations 
many of the company s products incorporate surrender charges  market interest rate adjustments or other features to encourage persistency 
approximately of the total insurance liabilities at december  had surrender penalties or other restrictions and approximately are not subject to surrender 
the company also seeks to maximize the total return on its investments through active investment management 
accordingly  the company has determined that the entire portfolio of fixed maturity securities is available to be sold in response to i changes in market interest rates  ii changes in relative values of individual securities and asset sectors  iii changes in prepayment risks  iv changes in credit quality outlook for certain securities  v liquidity needs  and vi other factors 
profitability of many of the company s products is significantly affected by the spreads between interest yields on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
although substantially all credited rates on annuity products may be changed annually subject to minimum guaranteed rates  changes in competition and other factors  including the impact of the level of surrenders and withdrawals  may limit the ability to adjust or to maintain crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions 
as of december   the average yield  computed on the cost basis of the investment portfolio  was  and the average interest rate credited or accruing to total insurance liabilities was  excluding interest bonuses guaranteed for the first year of the annuity contract only 
computer models were used to perform simulations of the cash flows generated from the company s existing business under various interest rate scenarios 
these simulations measured the potential gain or loss in fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
with such estimates  the company seeks to closely match the duration of assets to the duration of liabilities 
when the estimated durations of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in the value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
at december   the adjusted modified duration of fixed maturity securities and short term investments was approximately years  and the duration of insurance liabilities was approximately years 
if interest rates were to increase by from their december  levels  the company s fixed maturity securities and short term investments net of the corresponding changes in the values of cost of policies purchased  cost of policies produced and insurance liabilities would decline in fair value by approximately million 
the calculations involved in the company s computer simulations incorporate numerous assumptions  require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any management of the investment portfolio in reaction to such change 
consequently  potential changes in the value of our financial instruments indicated by the simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios  and the differences may be material 
because the company s investments and liabilities are actively managed  actual losses could be less than those estimated above
