item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s three basic businesses white paper  brown paper and building materials  are affected by changes in general economic conditions 
white and brown paper product sales and earnings tend to follow the general economy 
the sales and earnings of the building materials business are closely related to new housing starts  remodeling activity and the availability and terms of financing for construction 
all industry segments are influenced by global economic factors of supply and demand 
in addition  the cost of wood and recycled fiber  basic raw materials for all segments  are sensitive to various supply and demand factors including environmental issues affecting log supply 
results of operations vs 
consolidated net sales increased and operating earnings increased in compared to a strong performance from the brown paper segment and increases in unit shipments for many product lines contributed to the better results 
brown paper was the top performing segment in as operating earnings increased when compared to driving the increase in operating earnings was an increase in net sales of  as average sales prices increased in all product lines 
corrugated container prices increased and grocery bag prices increased over the prior year 
while price movements were positive in  unit shipment fluctuations also played a significant factor in increasing sales and earnings 
corrugated container unit shipments increased over the prior year  however grocery bag unit shipments decreased 
approximately of the increase in corrugated container shipments was due to increased internal converting capacity from capital project enhancements 
the remainder of the increase was a result of a full year of operation at our box plant in plant city  florida  and our sheet plant in portland  oregon  both of which came on line in the second quarter of in addition  the company acquired a interest in a box plant in mexico city  mexico  in january  raw material costs had a mixed impact on operating earnings during as occ costs declined while chip costs increased from the prior year 
white paper net sales increased over the prior year as increases in unit shipments more than offset decreases in average sales prices 
while sales were up compared to  operating earnings decreased in  primarily as a result of pricing pressures on market pulp and fine paper 
average sales prices for cut sheet and continuous forms showed slight increases over the prior year 
significant price declines from  came from hardwood market pulp  declining  and fine paper  declining 
the price decline was the result of pricing pressure which existed throughout much of as difficulties occurring in the asian economies impacted markets 
also negatively impacting white paper results were increased chip costs of and start up costs for the new paper machine at kentucky mills in overall  white paper unit shipments showed positive gains over  which led to the increase in net sales 
cut sheets increased while continuous forms decreased 
the increased cut sheet volume was the result of our new brownsville  tennessee  cut sheet plant which came on line in february  hardwood market pulp declined while fine paper unit shipments increased 
the fine paper increase was the result of our new kentucky paper machine  which successfully came on line at the end of the second quarter of building materials operating earnings decreased in and net sales slightly decreased from the prior year 
declining prices were the cause for the drop in operating earnings 
lumber reflected the most dramatic erosion as average sales prices decreased 
other price declines included in particleboard and in medium density fiberboard mdf 
the difficulties in the asian economies continued to create supply and demand imbalances  thus keeping prices depressed for these products in the pricing exception in was oriented strand board osb  which realized a price increase of 
while prices were down for most product lines  strong housing starts and low interest rates helped fuel unit shipment increases for most product lines in lumber was the primary benefactor as unit shipments increased over the prior year 
in addition  the start up of our new small log sawmill in taylor  louisiana  in august  and other capital project completions helped increase unit shipments 
other unit shipment increases included particleboard of and mdf of over the prior year 
mdf increased due to expansion from capital projects and the acquisition of a new facility in morcenx  france  in march  decreased plywood shipments of were the result of having no production at our taylor  louisiana  mill in  which closed in july   and downtime at our zwolle  louisiana  mill for six months due to a fire that halted production in the second quarter of in december   the company completed the construction of a new integrated lvl and i joist plant in simsboro  louisiana 
while the completion had no volume impact in  the addition will double the company s production capacity for i joist products in selling and administrative expenses sg a increased in due to assimilation of acquisitions and expansions that occurred during the year 
sg a as a percentage of sales  however  decreased to for compared to for interest expense was million in compared to million in  a increase 
the weighted average interest rate remained stable at in and the increase in expense was primarily due to an increase of million in average outstanding debt and a decrease in capitalized interest to million in from million in  as a result of the completion of the expansion at hawesville  kentucky  in june of results of operations vs 
consolidated net sales increased while operating earnings decreased compared to  as average sales prices declined for most products 
white paper product sales were down in  as sales prices declined in all product lines except specialty paper products and hardwood market pulp 
while specialty paper products were flat compared to  hardwood market pulp prices increased in unit shipment increases partially offset sales price decreases as volumes increased in most product lines 
unit shipments increased for cut sheets and for continuous forms  while market pulp remained steady with levels 
the cut sheet increase was the result of our development of market share in anticipation of the start up of the paper machine in hawesville  kentucky 
the impact of these changes reduced white paper operating earnings in brown paper products didn t fare much better in as sales decreased and operating earnings decreased from corrugated container unit shipments increased while grocery bags decreased 
increases achieved in the corrugated container line were due to the new portland  oregon  sheet plant and the new corrugated box plant in plant city  florida  both of which came on line in the first half of building materials sales increased and operating earnings increased in compared with as increases in unit shipments more than offset decreases in average sales prices 
unit shipment increases were realized from a full year of operation at the warrenton  oregon  sawmill  the mdf plant in clonmel  ireland  the converted mdf plant in eugene  oregon  and the osb plant in arcadia  louisiana 
additionally  the company began exporting logs in january  unit shipments increased in lumber  in osb and in mdf 
plywood incurred an decrease in unit shipments primarily due to the july closure of the taylor  louisiana  plywood facility 
sales price decreases partially offset unit shipment increases as prices declined in all product lines except plywood and european mdf 
plywood prices remained stable with a slight increase of over in addition  the european mdf market continued to be strong as prices increased over the fourth quarter of sales prices in remaining product lines decreased  ranging from in lumber to in osb  as supply and demand imbalances kept prices trending downward 
selling and administrative expenses sg a increased to of net sales in compared to in overall  sg a increased over interest expense was million in compared to million in interest expense increased as a result of increased debt related to the acquisitions discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting the effects of increased outstanding debt was the decrease in the company s weighted average interest rate from in to in in addition  capitalized interest increased from million in to million in due primarily to the capital expansion at hawesville  kentucky 
liquidity and capital resources willamette generates funds internally via net earnings adjusted for non cash charges against earnings such as depreciation  cost of fee timber harvested and deferred income taxes 
funds generated externally have usually been through debt financing 
in  cash flows from operating activities were million and represented an increase of from comparable cash flows in the increase was primarily achieved through increased net earnings and depreciation in compared to the prior year 
internally generated cash flows funded of capital expenditures in net working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in inventories resulting from new facilities and decreases in current notes payable and accounts payable 
the company is continually making capital expenditures at its manufacturing facilities to improve fiber utilization and labor efficiency and to expand production 
in  the company made million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment 
during the following major capital projects were completed addition of a new uncoated free sheet paper machine at hawesville  kentucky 
installation of a new biomass boiler at the kingsport  tennessee  fine paper mill 
construction of a new cut sheet plant in brownsville  tennessee 
construction of a new  integrated lvl and i joist plant near simsboro  louisiana 
construction of a new small log sawmill at taylor  louisiana 
relocation of a corrugated facility in sacramento  california 
major capital projects underway at december  include expansion of secondary fiber capacity at the paper mill in campti  louisiana 
upgrade of a paper machine at johnsonburg  pennsylvania 
construction and installation of a new recovery boiler at the albany  oregon  paper mill 
the cost of all major capital projects in progress at december  is estimated to be approximately million  of which million has already been spent 
these projects will be funded with internally generated cash flows and with external borrowings if needed 
in december   the company finalized the sale of  acres of southwest washington timberland for million 
the company acquired the land in as part of the purchase of cavenham forest industries 
the forest lands were sold as they were not critical to the long term fiber supply needs of the company s northwest operations 
proceeds of the sale were used to pay down existing debt 
in june   the company initiated a medium term note program and issued million of notes as of december  the medium term notes carry interest rates ranging from to and maturities from to years 
in addition  in january   the company issued million in debentures million at due and million at due the proceeds from both issuances were used to replace notes maturing in and reduce other bank borrowing 
the total debt to capital ratio decreased to at december  from at december  the company believes it has the resources available to meet its short term and long term liquidity requirements 
resources include internally generated funds  short term borrowing agreements and the unused portion of a million revolving loan available under an existing credit agreement 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of million of the company s common stock 
the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for million during the third and fourth quarters of on august   the board of directors declared a for stock split of its outstanding common stock 
the split was implemented as a stock dividend  payable september  at the rate of one share of common stock for each share held of record on august  other matters the company believes it is in substantial compliance with federal  state and local laws regarding environmental quality 
the us environmental protection agency epa released the final rules regarding air and water quality referred to as the cluster rules in early compliance with the cluster rules is required within three years of enactment  or by however  certain exceptions to the rules extend the time period for specific compliance requirements up to eight years 
the company  through previously completed and future projects  is making significant progress toward upgrading our mills 
the company plans to have all our mills in compliance with the cluster rules by the required deadlines 
in addition to the impact of the cluster rules on pulp and paper mills  the company s other operations are faced with increasingly stringent environmental regulations 
in the first quarter of  the company received from the epa a request for information under section of the clean air act the act requesting information for a period covering years 
the requests were focused on compliance with regulations under the prevention of significant deterioration program under the act 
on may   the epa issued a notice of violation nov alleging violations of the act and related state regulations  and on december   issued a second nov supplementing and clarifying the first nov 
the company is reviewing the allegations contained in the novs and is meeting with the epa to negotiate a resolution of the issues raised by the novs 
settlements by other companies in the wood products industry that have received novs under the act have involved the payment of fines and agreements to install emission control equipment and undertake supplemental environmental projects 
in november   the company received from the epa a request for information under section of the act requesting information with respect to the company s paper operations 
the request  which the company believes is similar to requests received by others in the paper industry  also focuses on compliance with regulations under the prevention of significant deterioration program under the act 
based upon either enacted or proposed regulations  the company estimates that over the next five years  additional capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will not exceed million 
although future environmental capital expenditures cannot be predicted with any certainty because of continuing changes in laws  the company believes that compliance with such environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position 
much attention has been given to the controversy concerning preservationists efforts to stop the harvest of timber from federal timberlands 
concurrent with these efforts have come increased regulations  limitations and restrictions on the harvest of timber from privately owned timberlands 
current rules and regulations do not significantly impact the company s ability to manage its timberlands on a sustained yield basis 
the year yk issue  which is common to most businesses  arises from the inability of systems and certain software application programs to properly recognize and process dates and date sensitive information on and beyond january  in  the company began working to address the possible effects of the yk issue on its information  financial and manufacturing systems 
these efforts include inventory assessment  modification and testing of these key systems 
willamette is fortunate in that many of the company s systems have been replaced during the past few years as we implemented new technology 
many of these new systems are already yk compliant 
to date  the company has spent million on yk compliance and currently estimates that total spending will approximate million 
these costs are being expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position 
as of december   a majority of the company s mission critical financial and information systems have been modified and tested for yk compliance and are expected to be compliant by the second quarter of in the manufacturing area  the company has completed the process of inventorying and assessing its primary manufacturing systems for yk compliance 
to date  no significant issues have been identified with the company s manufacturing systems and the company expects to resolve any compliance issues with these systems by the third quarter of the company has also been surveying its major vendors  suppliers and customers to assess the potential impact on its operations of these key third party relationships 
this process includes obtaining a letter of certification as to their efforts associated with yk compliance 
to date  no significant compliance issues have been identified with these third parties 
the company plans to continually update and evaluate compliance with these key third parties throughout the most reasonably likely worst case scenario facing the company is the occurrence of unscheduled down time at its facilities resulting from internal system difficulties or third party failures that could have a significant adverse effect on the company s earnings 
while it is the company s belief that all of its systems will be assessed and modified before january   there can be no guarantee that issues will not arise pertaining to these systems or that vendors  suppliers and customers will adequately address their yk compliance requirements 
the company is developing contingency plans relating to mission critical systems and key third parties 
these include identifying alternative suppliers and manufacturing systems  and working with major customers who may be affected by yk issues 
the yk compliance effort is continuously monitored by a special task force which makes regular reports to senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors 
over the years  inflation has resulted in replacement costs higher than those originally needed to purchase existing plant and equipment 
advancing technology and environmental concerns also contribute to higher costs 
productivity gains  because of technological improvements  may partially offset these increased costs 
our use of lifo to value inventories allows us to include these inflationary costs in the cost of sales
