item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company conducts business in two segments through its two primary operating subsidiaries  superior and enterprise 
superior is a leading healthcare consulting firm that provides a wide range of information technology consulting and strategic and operations management consulting services to a broad cross section of healthcare industry participants and healthcare information system vendors 
enterprise assists clients in various industries with network and telecommunication design and acquisition  enterprise messaging  intranet and web strategies  workgroup consulting  remote network administration and outsourcing  and software and application development solutions 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from fees for professional services  the substantial majority of which are billed at contracted hourly rates 
the company establishes standard billing guidelines based on the type and level of service offered 
actual billing rates are established on a project by project basis and may vary from the standard guidelines 
billings are generally made on a bi weekly basis to monitor client satisfaction and manage outstanding accounts receivable balances 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are provided 
a portion of the company s projects are billed on a fixed fee basis  typically on a monthly fee basis 
the company recognizes revenue on fixed fee projects in a manner similar to the percentage of completion basis 
as of december   the company has increased the number and size of projects billed on a fixed fee basis  however  in  less than ten percent of the company s revenues were realized in this manner 
increased use of fixed fee contracts subjects the company to increased risks  including cost overruns 
for outsourcing engagements  the company recognizes revenue in the amount billable under the contract  which is typically billable on a monthly basis 
as of december   the company has been awarded eight significant contracts to provide healthcare it outsourcing services 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profit margins on outsourcing contracts which are consistent with its historical levels of profitability 
the company s historical revenue growth is attributable to various factors  including an increase in the number of projects for existing and new clients  and expanded geographic presence 
in addition  the company seeks to increase revenues by expanding its range of specialty services 
the company manages its client development efforts through several strategic services groups  each having specific geographic responsibility and focus 
the company s most significant expense is cost of services  which consists primarily of consultant salaries and benefits 
in recent years  consultant compensation expense has grown faster than consultant billing rates  resulting in an increase in the company s cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
the company has sought to address this issue by adding an additional variable portion of compensation payable upon the achievement of measurable performance goals  including practice specific and company wide revenue and earnings targets 
in addition  the company has sought to address compensation expense pressures through increased use of stock options as an overall part of its compensation package 
the company s cost of services as a percentage of revenues is also impacted by its consultant utilization 
the company manages utilization by monitoring project requirements and timetables 
the number of consultants assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
project terminations  completions and scheduling delays may result in periods when consultants are not fully utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant project could cause the company to experience lower consultant utilization  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned consultants 
in addition  the establishment of new practice areas and the hiring of consultants in peak hiring periods have resulted in periods of lower consultant utilization and resulting downward pressure on margins until project volume increases in these new areas 
in the future  the establishment of new practice areas  hiring of consultants in peak hiring periods  and further geographic expansion  could from time to time adversely affect utilization 
variations in consultant utilization would result in quarterly variability of the company s cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
the company s consultants are generally employed on a full time basis  and therefore the company will  in the short run  incur substantially all of its employee related costs even during periods of low utilization 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of recruiting  continuing education  marketing  facilities  equipment depreciation  amortization of goodwill and administration  including compensation and benefits 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues continues to improve as the company leverages its infrastructure expense across its growing revenue base

the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was also attributable to increased operating efficiencies resulting from leveraging the company s infrastructure expense across its growing revenue base

the company incurred approximately  of costs in connection with the business acquisitions of comsul and chi during these costs consisted primarily of payments for legal  accounting  and investment banking fees related to the business acquisitions

approximately million in cash was used in acquisitions and the investment in drkoop 
com during see business developments in 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of its operations in the past three years 
yk readiness the year issue yk exists because some computer programs use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for instance  these programs record the year as some date sensitive software may interpret the year as rather than this could result in a system failure or miscalculations  causing disruptions of operations  including a temporary inability to engage in normal business activities 
readiness the company has substantially completed an inventory of its it systems and non it systems such as building facilities  voice mail  telephone and other systems containing embedded microprocessors 
the company expects to complete its assessment of yk readiness and complete its development of yk remediation plans for its mission critical systems by may  to remediate those systems by june  to complete testing of those systems by july  and to place those remediated systems in production by july the phases run concurrently for different systems 
the company considers a system mission critical if its failure would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
the above dates do not include the replacement of certain mission critical systems which were scheduled for replacement during for reasons unrelated to yk readiness 
all of these systems are expected to be replaced by september the company s principal mission critical it systems are its accounting and human resources systems  both of which are third party software applications 
the human resources software is being assessed  remediated and tested by the software vendor 
the accounting software is being upgraded with the vendor developed yk compliant upgrade 
both the accounting and human resources systems are expected to be remediated and tested during the second quarter of the company has sought information and assurances from its material third party vendors and suppliers regarding their yk readiness 
the company intends to continuously evaluate its vendor and supplier relationships and to develop contingency plans to mitigate the negative effects on the company from the yk problems of its suppliers and vendors 
cost the company estimates the cost of its yk remediation efforts as follows expenditure to date future total internal cost    external cost    total    internal costs reflect the estimated cost of the time of company employees devoted to yk remediation 
external costs reflect all other costs  including non employee labor  capital expenditures  and other costs 
approximately  of external costs are expected to be capitalizable 
the to date expenditures are as of march  the cost of senior management time devoted to monitoring and managing the company s yk remediation efforts is not included in the above estimates 
other risks the company performs yk services for certain clients  including assisting them in identifying and assessing potential yk problems 
in addition  former  present and future clients could assert that certain other services performed by the company involved or are related to yk issues 
there can be no assurance that various third party software products that the company has recommended and or implemented for its clients will all prove to be yk compliant 
any yk related failure of critical client systems or processes that are directly or indirectly connected to systems or software analyzed  designed  developed  or implemented by the company or by the businesses the company has acquired or may acquire may subject the company to claims  whether or not the failure is related to the services provided by the company 
the resolution of such claims  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company has attempted to include provisions in its client contracts that disclaim implied warranties  limit express warranties and impose limitations on the amounts and types of damages for which the company may be liable 
however  not all past and present client contracts include such provisions 
the company cannot ensure that it will be able to obtain these provisions in agreements for future projects  nor can it ensure that these provisions will prevent past  present or future clients from asserting yk claims against the company or will protect the company from  or limit the amount of the company s liability for  yk claims asserted against the company 
the company also may be subjected to yk claims arising from services performed by companies which the company has acquired or may acquire 
these services may have been performed prior to the acquisition and so would not have been in the company s control 
the resolution of such claims  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  in many instances the services that the company provides to its clients are performed at the client s site  and require the use of the client s information systems 
the company may be impaired in its ability to perform services on client systems which are unavailable as a result of a client s yk problems 
the company will be at risk from external infrastructure failures  including electrical power  telephone  and transportation  among others 
investigation and assessment of infrastructures is beyond the scope and resources of the company 
among the risks arising from these sources are the company s inability to conduct business in its offices or at client sites that lose electrical power or experience failure of elevator  security  hvac or other building systems  down time for billable personnel who are unable to travel to or from engagement locations if airline or other transportation providers cannot provide service  and disruption to company business if telephone or cellular communication is unavailable 
the yk event presents both risks and opportunity for the company 
on the one hand  there is a risk that clients may delay or cancel purchasing various services from the company because financial  technical  management or other resources of the clients are directed to their own yk remediation or yk problems 
on the other hand  as economic forces and the yk event impose change on the healthcare market  opportunities exist for the company to provide consulting services to its clients to assist them in dealing with the changing landscape 
there are further forces impacting the health care industry as yk approaches that present additional challenges and opportunities to the company 
broad segments of the healthcare provider community face financial stress from increasing costs  intensified competition and pressure on both revenues and margins 
financial pressures may be exacerbated by the balanced budget act  which will reduce the rate of growth in medicare and medicaid funds 
there are increasingly frequent reports of healthcare providers announcing negative or dramatically reduced operating margins for patient care 
there have also been provider bankruptcies and distressed consolidations 
financial instability among constituents of the company s client base may cause some clients to defer or cancel projects that require consulting services  and could adversely affect some clients ability to pay 
however  changes impacting the healthcare industry historically have generated new service opportunities for the company  and the company intends to actively pursue such opportunities as may be presented 
contingency plans the company expects to develop  assess and revise contingency plans on an ongoing basis throughout in an effort to mitigate the negative effect of any internal or external yk failure 
the company cannot assure that any contingency plans will prevent internal or external yk failures from having a material adverse effect on the company 
forward looking statements the estimates regarding the costs of the company s yk efforts  as well as statements regarding the potential effect of yk issues on the company and the company s plans to deal with issues or contingencies raised by yk issues  are forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual costs  effects or plans to differ materially from the discussion above 
among these risks or uncertainties are the following difficulty in successfully identifying  assessing  replacing and testing all hardware  software and systems which may be affected by yk problems or which may contain microprocessors affected by those problems  difficulty in identifying all third parties including but not limited to clients  third party suppliers  vendors  and other providers whose inability to process yk date information may affect the company  the company s lack of control over and limited knowledge of the yk remediation efforts and yk readiness of those third parties  the availability  to the company and material third parties of qualified professionals to analyze and remedy yk problems  the difficulty in projecting labor or consulting costs  particularly in light of the fact that demand for yk remediation services will become more intense as the year approaches  and the effect of general economic conditions on the willingness of third parties to make the expenditures necessary to address yk problems which may affect the company

shares used in calculating net earnings per share basic         shares used in calculating net earnings per share diluted         revenues and operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to several factors  such as the number and significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a quarter  delays incurred in connection with a project  consultant hiring  and utilization 
the timing of revenues varies from quarter to quarter because the company s sales cycle can be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments  the general ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the timing of the establishment of new practice areas  geographic expansion and the hiring of key individuals can also have an effect on consultant utilization 
seasonal factors such as vacation days  total business days in a quarter or the business practices of clients  such as deferred commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar or the client s fiscal year  can cause the company to experience lower consultant utilization 
because a significant percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number or size of client assignments or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  the company s annual employees meeting  which this year is scheduled for may  can result in lower consultant utilization in the quarter in which the meeting occurs
