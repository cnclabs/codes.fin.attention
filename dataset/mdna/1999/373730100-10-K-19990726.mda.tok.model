item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for years ended april    and results of operations in may  the company acquired the outstanding capital stock of spandex plc spandex 
accordingly  spandex was included in the company s consolidated balance sheet at april  and in the company s results from operations and cash flows for the twelve month period ended april  in february  the company acquired the outstanding stock of coburn optical industries  inc coburn 
coburn was included in the company s consolidated balance sheet at april  and and in the company s results from operations and cash flows for the twelve month period ended april  and the two months ended april  in march  the company sold its gerber systems unit  which comprised the company s imaging and inspection systems product class 
as a result  the company s april  balance sheet and the fiscal year consolidated financial statements do not include any gerber systems activity 
revenue vs 
consolidated revenue in was million  an increase of million or percent from million in the increase in reflected both higher product sales and service revenue 
each of the company s operating segments experienced sales growth in  except for the company s apparel and flexible materials segment 
the increases reflected higher revenue from the acquisitions of spandex and coburn incremental increases of million and million  respectively  for the twelve month period ended april   net of intercompany eliminations 
the sale of the company s imaging and inspection systems product class in last year s fourth quarter was an offsetting factor million in sales in fiscal year 
adjusting for the acquisitions and divestiture  combined sales and service revenue was lower this year compared with last year 
the decrease in revenue in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment in the year was caused predominately by lower sales of the company s automated cutting equipment in certain international markets particularly turkey  southeast asia  and brazil 
strong sales into mexico was an offsetting factor for this segment 
the company also experienced weakness in its ophthalmic lens processing operating segment in this was caused by softness in end sales of prescription optical lenses  consolidation in both the retail and wholesale segments of the industry  and  to a lesser extent  the economic weakness in brazil 
the company s management took actions to resize the optical lens manufacturing business to account for the lower volume  which included reducing employee headcount and other initiatives 
these actions are intended to eliminate approximately million from costs and expenses in the next fiscal year 
combined sales and service revenue for the sign making and specialty graphics operating segment was slightly higher this year compared with last year 
sales of the company s aftermarket supplies increased in compared with  especially in the sign making and specialty graphics segment 
demand for consumables for the gerber edge  a digital imaging system for color printing directly on sign vinyl  was the principal factor 
service revenue increased million percent in  after adjusting for the elimination of the service revenue from the imaging and inspection systems product class 
this increase was caused principally by growth in the company s service operations  and also by the acquisitions of spandex and coburn 
on a geographic basis  sales gains were realized in in the north american  latin american  and european markets 
acquisitions were a major factor spandex s sales to canada and europe added million and million  respectively  and coburn s sales to north america  latin america  and europe added million  million  and million  respectively 
after adjusting for the business acquisitions and divestiture  sales to european and latin american customers were million and million higher  respectively  due to an increase in demand for the company s apparel and flexible materials systems 
these increases were somewhat offset by lower sales of apparel and flexible materials systems in certain international markets  including southeast asia and turkey 
in  sales to pacific and far east customers were million lower than  and sales to middle eastern customers were million lower than revenue vs 
consolidated revenue in was million  an increase of million or percent from million in the increase in reflected higher product sales and a slight increase in service revenue 
each of the company s operating segments experienced sales growth in  except for the company s imaging and inspection systems product class  which was sold in march consolidated revenue was also bolstered by acquisitions in gerber technology s gt cutting edge 
registered trademark  an acquisition in the fourth quarter of  and coburn optical industries  inc  an acquisition in the fourth quarter of  incrementally added million and million to sales 
the largest increase in product sales occurred in the company s apparel and flexible materials operating segment 
significant increases within this operating segment came from gerbercutter fabric cutting systems and fabric spreading systems 
also contributing were higher sales of related software products  including a product data management system that provides a powerful tool for developing product specifications  controlling and managing data  and documenting the product development process  production  and quality requirements 
product sales also increased in from sales of the company s lens edge finishing systems to both the optical retail chains and the wholesale optical laboratories 
the company benefited from higher demand in these markets for its complete lab system 
another developing market was independent eyewear practitioners ophthalmologists  optometrists  and opticians 
sales to this market  as well as sales to the wholesale optical laboratories  were generated from the company s strategic distribution alliance with a major  vertically integrated lens manufacturer 
higher sales of the company s aftermarket supplies for the sign making and specialty graphics operating segment also contributed to the sales increase 
gerber edge consumables were the principal cause 
the revenue decrease in the imaging and inspection systems product class in was caused by lower shipments of computer to plate imaging systems for the commercial printing industry and the inclusion of less than a full year s results eleven months in the company s consolidated results of operations 
this was partially offset by higher shipments of oem supplied equipment for the electronics industry 
on a geographic basis  sales gains were realized in in each of the company s major geographic markets us  europe  far east  and other international 
most notably  export sales to european customers improved significantly  up million from the previous year to million 
this increase was the continuation of a stronger shipment trend that began in the second half of fiscal in total  export sales from the united states in were million  percent higher than the prior year  and represented percent of total revenue compared with percent in both and revenue vs 
consolidated revenue in was million  an increase of million or percent from million in the increase in reflected higher product sales and a slight increase in service revenue 
each of the company s operating segments experienced sales growth in  except for the company s apparel and flexible materials operating segment 
the decrease in this segment was caused by relative weakness in demand from the apparel industry for fabric cutting systems  which occurred in the first half of the fiscal year 
the largest increase in product sales occurred in imaging systems as the company attempted to penetrate the commercial printing industry with computer to plate digital imaging systems 
increased sales of the company s sign making systems and aftermarket supplies also contributed to the sales increase 
the sales increase was fueled by the introduction of two new high speed sign making routers and strong demand for aftermarket supplies  especially consumables for the gerber edge 
product sales gains were also realized in from sales of the company s optical lens manufacturing systems to both the optical retail chains and the wholesale optical laboratories 
in particular  the opening of new retail stores  as well as the conversion of existing stores  led to higher demand for the company s complete lab system 
the company s initial strategic distribution alliance with a major  vertically integrated lens manufacturer contributed to higher sales to the wholesale optical laboratories 
in the second half of  the company experienced stronger demand  especially from the us and certain international markets  for its products in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment 
also contributing were higher sales of related software products  including a product data management system 
slightly affecting comparability was the company s acquisition of cutting edge  inc cutting edge in february  which added million to fourth quarter and annual revenue 
cutting edge manufactures high performance single layer fabric cutting systems for the industrial fabric  automotive  furniture  apparel  and composite materials industries 
geographically  sales gains were realized in in each of the company s major markets 
export sales to the far east improved significantly  up million from the previous year to million  as all of the company s product classes had increased sales in that market in export sales to latin america were also up 
the increase in latin american exports was largely a result of increased demand for the company s computer controlled pre production  design  manufacturing  spreading and unit production systems for the apparel and flexible materials industries 
in total  export sales from the united states in rose million  or percent  from the previous year and represented percent of total revenue 
gross margins the overall gross profit margin in was percent  which was lower than the prior year margin of percent 
gross profit margins on product sales were lower  while service margins were higher 
the decrease in product gross profit margins percent in compared with percent in was related primarily to the inclusion of spandex in the company s financial statements in fiscal year as a distributor  spandex historically had gross profit margins substantially lower than the company s 
however  spandex s historical operating margins were incrementally higher than the company s recent operating margins  owing in part to the absence of spending on research and development 
also reducing the comparative product gross profit margins in was the inclusion of coburn 
a larger percentage of coburn s product mix has historically come from sales of aftermarket products eg  consumables  which generally have gross profit margins lower than equipment sales 
compared with  lower margins were also earned by the company s apparel and flexible materials segment in  caused in part by price discounting on sales of cutting and marker making systems to the apparel industry  and in part by the weakening european currencies that occurred later in the year 
service gross profit margins were higher in than in the prior year 
the increase was caused primarily by the elimination in of the low service margins of the company s imaging and inspection systems product class  which was included in s results 
the overall gross profit margin in was percent compared with percent in this increase reflected higher margins on product sales  which were partially offset by lower service margins 
the gross profit margin on product sales was percent in compared with percent in favorable volume effects from higher shipments of fabric cutting systems  especially in north american markets  was a primary reason for the improvement 
this was partially offset by higher sales of oem supplied equipment for the electronics industry and also by price discounting on computer to plate imaging systems for the commercial printing market 
service gross profit margins decreased in to percent from percent in the reduction in service margins was caused by costs in associated with development of an applications training revenue stream from the computer to plate systems business 
the overall gross profit margin in was percent compared with percent in this reflected lower margins on product sales partially offset by higher service margins 
the gross profit margin on product sales was percent in compared with percent in contributing to the lower product gross margin in were higher sales of oem supplied equipment  particularly for the electronics industry  and price discounting on newly introduced computer to plate digital imaging systems in support of efforts to penetrate the commercial printing market 
product gross margins were also pressured by price discounting on sales of cutting and marker making systems to the apparel industry  especially in the european market 
service gross profit margins increased in to percent from percent in the improvement in service gross profit margins resulted  in part  from the utilization of service personnel on a product retrofit program 
selling  general administrative expenses selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses were million percent of revenue in  which compared with million percent of revenue in and million percent of revenue in the spandex and coburn acquisitions were the principal reasons for the dollar increase in over the amortization of the spandex and coburn acquisition goodwill million and million  respectively was also a factor contributing to the overall dollar increase in the elimination of the s  g a associated with the imaging and inspection systems product class was an offsetting factor 
the year to year s  g a expense increases in and related primarily to the higher sales volumes 
significant marketing expenses associated with the introduction of computer to plate imaging systems for the commercial printing and graphic arts industries affected and s  g a expenses 
increased expenses in were also caused by higher marketing expenses associated with major trade shows  the inclusion of the first full year of cutting edge expenses  and the inclusion of two months of coburn expenses 
partially offsetting these increases was the effect of a cost reduction program implemented at the company s gerber technology subsidiary 
research and development expenses the company has historically committed significant resources to research and the development of new products and strives to maintain a leading position in automation technology in the various markets it serves 
in  the company continued to commit significant resources to research and the development of new products  although the ratio of research and development r d expenses to revenue declined significantly 
r d expense of million in was roughly the same as the prior year 
however  the ratio of r d to revenue declined to percent this year from percent last year 
the lower current year ratio was caused by growth in the revenue base from the spandex acquisition without commensurate r d expense 
spandex is predominantly a distribution company and does not incur r d 
management anticipates that the lower ratio of r d expense to revenue experienced in will continue 
in addition to the incremental expenses of coburn  r d dollar increases in were also related to the development of new sign making plotters and output devices million and automated cutting systems million 
these increases were offset by the elimination of the company s imaging and inspection system product class 
r d expenses increased in although they represented percent of revenue in compared with percent of revenue in the dollar increase related to increased development of new computer controlled sign making and graphic arts systems million  ophthalmic lens manufacturing systems million  and the inclusion of the expenses of cutting edge million 
partially offsetting these were decreased development expenses for interactive imaging and inspection systems million 
r d expenses in were higher than in due largely to the increased development of new interactive imaging and inspection systems million 
also contributing to higher r d levels in were the development of new sign making plotters million and new windows based software products for the company s optical lens manufacturing systems million 
non recurring special charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a million pre tax charge related to the write down of certain assets of the company s gerber systems unit 
gerber systems comprised the company s imaging and inspection systems product class  which was sold to the barco group of belgium as of march  for million in cash plus contingent future royalties 
the special charge reflected the write down of inventory  accounts receivable  and other items 
the special charge amounted to approximately million after taxes or 
per share on a diluted basis 
interest expense in  interest expense increased significantly to million from million in this increase was caused by significantly higher debt balances that financed the acquisition of spandex 
most of these borrowings were against a million multi currency revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on these borrowings is variable and is based on the london interbank offered rate libor for the relevant currency and term  plus a margin based on the relationship of the company s consolidated total debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
in april  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract with an initial notional amount of million that decreases ratably to million over a four year term 
the company designated this swap as a hedge of its exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to the libor based interest payments due on the us dollar denominated portion of the company s borrowings 
the interest differential paid or received under this contract will be recognized as an adjustment to the effective yield of the underlying borrowing hedged 
the combination of the swap and the credit facility pricing results in a net cash outflow equal to an interest rate range of percent to percent  depending on the margin on the credit facility 
in addition to the credit facility  the company s debt obligations included industrial revenue bonds with short term variable tax exempt interest rates in each of the years   and in february  the company borrowed million to finance the acquisition of coburn 
that debt was fully repaid by april  largely with the proceeds from the gerber systems sale 
with the exception of that borrowing  debt levels changed only slightly in and  and the changes in the company s interest expense reflected primarily the movements in short term interest rates 
other income other income in included a gain of approximately million from the final settlement of the company s uk patent litigation with lectra systemes sa of france  which related to computer controlled cutting equipment 
other income in included a gain of approximately million from life insurance benefits the company received upon the death of mr 
h 
joseph gerber  the company s founder and former president 
exclusive of these amounts  other income in   and came primarily from interest on investments and royalty income 
taxes the statutory us federal income tax rate was percent for   and while the effective income tax provision rates were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
offsetting the statutory us federal income tax rate were research and development tax credits reinstated through legislation in  tax exempt interest income from the company s municipal bond investments in years and  and the tax savings derived from the company s foreign sales corporation fsc 
each of these items impacted the effective income tax rate to a greater degree in because of the reduction in pre tax income from the non recurring special charge 
the higher tax rate in was primarily the result of the goodwill amortization related to the acquisitions of spandex and coburn  which is not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes 
the year to year increase in the provision rate also reflected the higher marginal income tax rates associated with higher levels of pre tax earnings in and the liquidation of the company s investments in tax exempt municipal securities 
the tax exempt life insurance benefit noted above reduced the effective tax rate in net earnings net earnings were million  or on a diluted per share basis for fiscal in fiscal  net earnings were million  or diluted earnings per share before the non recurring special charge 
the special charge of approximately million  or 
diluted earnings per share  reduced net earnings to million  or 
diluted earnings per share in reporting in june  the fasb issued two new statements  sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
these statements have been implemented by the company and are disclosed in the accompanying financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  which is effective for years beginning after december  the statement revises the required disclosures for employee benefit plans  but it does not change the measurement or recognition of such plans 
this statement has also been implemented by the company and is disclosed in the accompanying financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company expects to adopt the new statement for the fiscal year beginning may   which is in accordance with the effective date 
the statement will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
financial condition liquidity the company s short term liquidity at april  was substantially the same as the preceding year end and adequate for the company s requirements 
cash and short term cash investments totaled million at april  compared with million at april  working capital levels were also adequate to meet the operating requirements of the company 
net working capital was million at april   compared with million at april  the million increase in net working capital in was largely attributable to the spandex acquisition 
the working capital ratio at april  was to compared with to at april  cash flows cash provided by operations is the company s primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures 
operating activities provided million in cash in cash in was generated by earnings and the non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and lower inventory balances 
the lower inventory balances were a result of management s on going program to improve inventory turnover 
cash generated from operations was slightly offset by lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances due largely to the timing of vendor payments 
the principal non operating use of cash in was for the purchase of spandex for million  which included the repayment of its debt 
the financing for the acquisition was provided primarily by a million multi currency revolving credit facility the company entered into with a group of major us and international commercial banks 
another significant non operating use of cash in was for the company s common stock repurchase program 
in november  the board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to  shares  or approximately percent of the company s then issued and outstanding common stock 
in the year ended april   the company repurchased  shares  of which  shares were under the new authorization and  were under an earlier authorization 
the cost of these shares was million  or an average cost of per share 
under the authorization  management of the company has discretion to purchase stock as market conditions warrant 
other non operating uses of cash in were repayments of long term debt of million  additions to property  plant  and equipment of million  and payment of dividends of million 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal will be in the range of million and expects to fund these with cash on hand and cash from operations 
the company s total debt at april  was million  which was up substantially from the april  balance of million and caused by the acquisition of spandex 
strong cash flow generation in enabled the company to reduce its total debt outstanding at april  from a peak of million immediately after the acquisition of spandex 
net debt total debt less cash and investments was million at april  versus a net cash position of million at april  the ratio of net debt to total capital was percent at april  operating activities provided million in cash in the cash generated by earnings and by the non cash charges against earnings for depreciation  amortization  and the special charge recorded on the sale of the imaging and inspection systems product class was somewhat offset by growth in inventories 
the growth in inventories related to a significantly higher volume of business in the fourth quarter 
significant operating cash flow was also generated in from increases in accounts payable  which was related primarily to improved management of vendor payment cycles 
significant non operating uses of cash in were million for the acquisition of coburn and repayment of its debt  purchase of treasury stock of million  additions to property  plant and equipment of million  and dividends on common stock of million 
significant non operating sources of cash included million in proceeds from maturities and the sale of the company s longer term investment portfolio of municipal securities and million in proceeds from the sale of the imaging and inspection systems product class  including the sale of a facility 
operating activities provided million in cash in the cash generated by earnings and by depreciation and amortization was offset substantially by growth in accounts receivable 
the growth in receivables related to a significantly higher volume of business in the fourth quarter 
also affecting the company s receivables in were extended payment terms given on sales of computer to plate digital imaging systems 
significant non operating uses of cash were million for the acquisition of cutting edge and million for repayment of its debt  additions to property  plant and equipment of million  and dividends on common stock of million 
debt in may  the company obtained a five year million multi currency revolving credit facility from a group of major us and international commercial banks 
the purpose of the facility was to finance the acquisition of the capital stock of spandex and the refinancing of its debt  and for other general corporate purposes 
the interest rate on borrowings under this facility is variable and is based on libor london interbank offered rate plus an applicable margin  which ranges from percent to percent based on the relationship of the company s consolidated total debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
the weighted average interest rate on this facility as of april  was percent 
this credit line also has a facility fee  which ranges from to percent of the credit line 
covenants in the credit facility require the company to maintain certain levels of net worth  certain ratios of total debt to ebitda  and a minimum fixed charge coverage amount  as defined therein 
at april   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
under the most restrictive of these covenants  approximately million of retained earnings was not available for dividend payments at april  in addition to the million revolving credit facility  the company has a million multi currency line of credit from a major european commercial bank 
this line of credit is available in various sub limits to certain of the company s european subsidiaries  and repayment is guaranteed by the parent company 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at percent above the libor for the relevant currency and term with a commitment fee of percent of the unused amount 
at april   the company s bank lines of credit included a million bridge loan facility and a million line of credit from a major us commercial bank 
the bridge loan facility supported the company s tender offer to purchase the outstanding stock of spandex 
both of these credit instruments were replaced with the million revolving credit facility 
at april  and  the company s long term debt also consisted of tax exempt industrial revenue bonds amounting to million and million at those dates 
scheduled maturities of this long term debt in amount to 
million  and payment is expected to be made with cash from operations 
with the addition of the borrowings under the million revolving credit facility in  the company s ratio of total debt to total capitalization was percent at april  compared with percent at april  forward exchange contracts as of april   the company was party to approximately million in forward exchange contracts providing for the delivery by the company of various currencies in exchange for others over the succeeding five months 
the counterparties to the forward exchange contracts were major international commercial banks 
the company continually monitors its open forward exchange contract position and does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
in management s opinion  these financial instruments do not represent a material off balance sheet risk in relation to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon market prices at april  for future deliveries of the various currencies  the hedging gain deferred at that date amounted to approximately million 
interest rate swap in april  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract with an initial notional amount of million that reduces ratably to million over a four year term 
the company designated this swap as a hedge of its exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to the libor plus applicable margin interest payments due on the us dollar denominated portion of borrowings under its million multi currency revolving credit facility 
the interest differential paid or received under this contract will be recognized as an adjustment to the effective yield of the underlying borrowing hedged 
the market value of this contract at april  was approximately million 
lease financing arrangements the company has an agreement with a major financial services institution to provide lease financing to purchasers of the company s equipment 
the present value of the lease receivables financed under this agreement amounted to approximately million at april  and million at april  the underlying equipment collateralizes the lease receivables 
in the event of default by the lessee  the company has liability to the financial services institution under recourse provisions 
the company s liability for uncollected amounts financed in excess of the estimated resale value of the equipment is limited to the extent of loss pools 
these loss pools are established as percentages of each associated group of transactions that are financed in a calendar year and range from five to ten percent of the amount financed 
management believes that the allowance it has established for losses under the recourse provisions is adequate to cover the company s obligations 
year the company recognizes the business risks posed by the year computer date issue 
the company continues to make this issue a top business priority and is actively working to control the associated risks 
each gerber scientific business unit is responsible for developing and executing comprehensive plans to minimize and  to the extent possible  eliminate any major business interruption that could be caused from year issues relating to products  facilities  internal systems  key suppliers  and customers 
in addition  the company has a year corporate oversight committee that reports to executive management and to the board of directors 
the company has completed its year awareness  assessment  and renovation phases and is in the process of carrying out the validation phase 
testing of manufactured products  including internally developed software  has been completed 
the results are available for customers through the company s web sites 
fortunately  most of the company s products do not use dates in any critical calculations 
however  the vast array of products and services sold by the company  both today and in the past  may expose the company to claims from its customers and third parties  impair market acceptance of the company s products or services  or result in payment of damages 
in most cases  the company contractually limits or disclaims consequential damages in the sales contracts 
however  no assurance can be given that the aggregate cost of defending and resolving such claims will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s critical internal systems have been upgraded or replaced 
the company is in the process of validating some third party software packages for year compliance 
the company has also been assessing its year risks related to significant relationships with third parties via on going communication with its critical suppliers and customers 
as part of the process  the company requested written affirmation from suppliers and customers that they have year readiness programs in place and will be ready when necessary 
responses to these inquiries have been reviewed 
further analysis  including site visits  are being conducted as necessary and contingency plans are being developed as issues arise in this analysis 
despite these efforts  the company can provide no assurance that supplier and customer year compliance plans will be successfully completed in a timely manner 
year expenditures were not material  have substantially been incurred  and were funded through cash from operations 
the schedule for completion and the remaining associated costs are based on management s estimates  which include assumptions of future events 
there can be no assurance that the company and its suppliers and customers will be fully year compliant by january  such occurrences as loss of revenue  production delays  lack of third party readiness  and other business interruptions could adversely impact the company 
accordingly  the company will develop contingency plans to address potential issues  which include identification of alternate suppliers 
the ultimate effects on the company or its suppliers or customers of not being fully year compliant is not reasonably estimable 
however  the company believes its year remediation efforts  together with the diverse nature of its businesses  help reduce the potential impact of noncompliance to levels that will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
euro conversion on january   the european economic and monetary union emu entered a three year transition phase during which a common currency  the euro  was introduced in participating countries 
initially  the euro is being used for wholesale financial transactions and it will replace the legacy currencies that will be withdrawn between january  and july  the company is in the process of identifying and ensuring that all euro conversion compliance issues are addressed 
the company has identified certain issues and developed implementation plans associated with the conversion  including technical adaptation of information technology systems  foreign currency considerations  and long term competitive implications of the conversions 
these implementation plans are expected to be completed within a timetable that is consistent with the transition phases of the euro 
based on its evaluation to date  management believes that the introduction of the euro  including the total costs for the conversion  will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  uncertainty exists as to the effects the euro will have on the marketplace and there is no guarantee that all issues will be foreseen and corrected or that third parties will address the conversion successfully
