item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations wps resources corporation wps resources corporation wpsr is a holding company 
approximately of wpsr s assets at december   approximately of its revenues  and of its net income were derived from electric utility operations 
wpsr s wholly owned subsidiaries include two regulated utilities  wisconsin public service corporation wpsc  an electric and gas utility  and upper peninsula power company uppco  an electric utility  and two primary nonregulated subsidiaries  wps energy services  inc esi  and wps power development  inc pdi 
compared with wps resources corporation overview wpsr s results of operations and financial position for and include the effects of the merger with upper peninsula energy corporation upen which was effective september   and accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in accordance with the terms of the merger  each of the  outstanding shares of upen common stock no par value were converted into shares of wpsr common stock  subject to adjustment for cash payments for fractional shares 
in conjunction with this merger  wpsr expensed transaction charges of approximately million in and million in these merger transaction charges consist of the following merger charges millions investment bankers legal accounting other total in addition  uppco  upen s primary subsidiary  recorded severance costs of million and an additional million in other merger related expenses in wpsr consolidated operating revenues were billion in compared with million in  an increase of 
net income was million in and million in  a decrease of 
basic and diluted earnings per share were in compared with in  a decrease of 
the primary reasons for the decrease in earnings  as explained below  were the impact of unusually warm winter weather  the effects of a full year electric rate decrease at wpsc  higher maintenance expenses at wpsc  decreased other income  higher other operating expenses  and a decrease in wpsc s gas margin 
partially offsetting these factors were an increase in electric utility margins and an increase in nonregulated margins 
overview of utility operations wpsc and uppco revenues at wpsc were million in compared with million in  a decrease of 
earnings were million in and million in  a decrease of 
the primary reasons for the decrease in earnings at wpsc were the impact of unusually warm winter weather  increased maintenance expenses  a decrease in other income  an increase in other operating expenses  and a decrease in the gas margin 
partially offsetting these factors were an increase in the electric utility margin and a decrease in interest expense 
revenues at uppco were million in compared with million in  an increase of 
earnings were million in compared with million in  a decrease of 
the primary reasons for the decrease in earnings at uppco were higher maintenance and other operating expenses partially offset by an increase in the electric margin 
electric utility operations wpsc and uppco wpsr consolidated electric utility margins increased million  or  primarily due to increased kilowatt hour kwh sales of to wpsc customers as a result of a increase in cooling degree days in partially offsetting the increase in electric margins in was the impact on wpsc of a public service commission of wisconsin pscw rate order which was effective for the entire year in but was only effective in for the period after february  this order authorized an electric revenue reduction 
wpsr consolidated electric margins thousands revenues    fuel and purchased power    margin    sales in kwh thousands    does not include uppco unbilled kwh 
wpsr consolidated electric utility revenues increased million  or  largely due to increased revenues of million from wpsc s wholesale customers and million from wpsc s commercial and industrial customers as a result of the warmer weather 
also included in electric revenues are surcharge revenues at wpsc of million related to the recovery of the deferred costs for the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee steam generator repairs 
partially offsetting these increases to revenues were the electric rate reduction and a million refund of wpsc s transmission revenues as the result of a federal energy regulatory commission ferc settlement related to open access transmission tariff rates 
wpsr consolidated electric production fuel expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of increased generation expense 
kewaunee was out of service for the first six months of as the result of an extended outage to repair steam generators  thus  in comparison  the higher generation expense in wpsc is currently the operator and owner of kewaunee 
wpsr consolidated purchased power expense decreased million  or  primarily due to decreased purchase requirements at wpsc in the first half of purchase requirements at wpsc in the first half of were higher due to lack of production at kewaunee in the first and second quarters of as a result of an extended outage 
kewaunee was also off line in for a six week scheduled refueling outage 
also contributing to lower purchased power expense at wpsc was a million credit to purchased power expense in the fourth quarter of related to the settlement of litigation involving a contract with a power supplier 
the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of fuel and purchased power  within a specified range  on to its customers through a fuel adjustment clause 
gas utility operations wpsc wpsr consolidated gas margin decreased million in  or  primarily due to a reduction in heating degree days 
wpsr consolidated gas margins thousands revenues    purchase costs    margin    volume in therms thousands    gas operating revenues decreased million  or 
this decrease was due to unusually mild weather in resulting in lower gas therm sales for of 
also contributing to the decrease in gas operating revenues was a reduction in revenues of million for refunds from anr pipeline company which wpsc passed on to its gas customers in the second quarter of gas purchase costs decreased million  or 
this decrease was due to reduced customer demand as a result of the mild weather during also contributing to the decrease in gas costs was a million refund from anr pipeline company which was credited to gas expense in the second quarter of under current regulatory practice  the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a purchased gas adjustment clause pgac 
other utility expenses income wpsc and uppco other operating expenses at wpsc increased million  or  primarily due to higher benefit costs in other operating expenses at uppco increased million  or  primarily as the result of the accrual of million in merger related severance expense in other operating expenses at uppco in included costs incurred related to the termination of uppco s presque isle plant operating agreement with wisconsin electric power company wepco 
uppco had staffed and operated wepco s presque isle power plant through december   at which time the operating agreement was terminated 
maintenance expense at wpsc increased million  or  primarily as a result of increased expenses at kewaunee during the second and fourth quarters of this increase was partly due to the recognition in the second quarter of of the deferred expenses for kewaunee steam generator repairs 
the pscw approved deferral of the repairs in  the cost of which has been collected in the second quarter of through a million electric revenue surcharge 
in addition  maintenance expense at kewaunee increased in the fourth quarter of due to a scheduled refueling outage 
depreciation and decommissioning expenses at wpsc increased million  or  due to an increased plant base and to the accelerated recovery of investment in kewaunee and accelerated funding of kewaunee decommissioning costs 
accelerated recovery of investment and funding began on february  and  therefore  was effective for all of but only a portion of other income at wpsc decreased million  or  primarily due to one time gains on sales of nonutility property which occurred in these gains represented an increase in earnings for of approximately per share 
overview of nonregulated operations nonregulated operations primarily consist of the gas and electric sales at esi  an energy marketing subsidiary 
nonregulated operations also include those of wpsr as a holding company and those of pdi which develops electric generation projects  invests in generating projects  and provides services to the electric power generation industry 
nonregulated operations experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in although nonregulated margins continue to grow  losses are being experienced due to gas and electric trading losses and expenses associated with the expansion of customer base

revenues at esi were million in compared with million in  an increase of 
esi experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in the primary reasons for the increased loss at esi were increased electric and gas trading losses primarily due to market volatility  and higher operating expenses due to expansion of the energy trading business 
partially offsetting these factors was an increase in the gas margin 
nonregulated margins esi gas margins at esi were million in compared with million in  an increase of 
electric margins at esi remained fairly stable 
gas revenues at esi were million in compared with million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was the result of sales volume growth and expansion to additional geographic areas 
electric revenues at esi were million in and million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was also the result of sales volume growth 
esi s cost of sales were million in and million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to increased gas purchases and purchased power of million and million  respectively  as a result of customer growth and higher costs of purchases 
other nonregulated expenses income esi other operating expenses at esi increased million  or  due to expansion of the business 
esi experienced gas trading losses of million in and million in largely due to market volatility 
esi also experienced electric trading losses of million in primarily due to losses in the third quarter related to the unprecedented market volatility in the electric trading market 
price risk management activities esi wpsr has not experienced significant price risk activities at its utility operations which are not recoverable through customer rates  however  price risk is experienced at esi 
esi utilizes derivative financial and commodity instruments derivatives  including futures and forward contracts  to reduce market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and electricity sold under firm commitments with certain of its customers 
esi also utilizes derivatives  including price swap agreements  call and put option contracts  and futures and forward contracts  to manage market risk associated with a portion of its anticipated supply requirements 
in addition  esi utilizes derivatives  within specified guidelines  for trading purposes 
gains or losses on derivatives associated with firm commitments are recognized as adjustments to the cost of sales or to revenues when the related transactions affect earnings 
gains and losses on derivatives associated with forecasted transactions are recognized when such forecasted transactions affect earnings 
at december   million in losses related to firm commitments and forecasted transactions were deferred 
if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur  any gain or loss on the derivative instrument as of such date is immediately recognized in earnings 
derivatives for trading purposes are marked to market each accounting period  and gains and losses are recognized as a component of other income at that time 
in and  trading losses of million and million  respectively  were recognized 
at december   esi had outstanding million notional dekatherms of natural gas under futures and option agreements and million notional dekatherms of natural gas under basis swap agreements for purposes of managing market risk 
the financial instruments outstanding at december  expire at various times through august esi has certain gas sales commitments through august with a range of sale prices from to per dekatherm and a range of associated gas purchase costs of to per dekatherm

earnings were million in and million in  a decrease of 
the primary reason for the decrease in earnings at uppco was a decrease in the electric utility margin 
electric utility operations wpsc and uppco wpsr consolidated electric utility margins decreased million  or  primarily due to implementation of a pscw rate order at wpsc which authorized a million  or  electric revenue reduction 
a second factor contributing to decreased margins was increased replacement power costs as a result of an extended outage at kewaunee 
a surcharge authorized by the pscw partially offset increases in replacement power costs in the latter part of the first quarter and in the second quarter of in spite of a decrease in cooling degree days  wpsr consolidated electric kwh sales increased by primarily due to increased demand by wpsc s commercial and industrial customers 
wpsc s commercial and industrial kwh sales increased  while wholesale kwh sales decreased 
wpsr consolidated electric utility revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to the electric rate decrease at wpsc 
wpsr consolidated electric production fuel expense increased million  or 
nuclear fuel expense at wpsc was million lower than in due to decreased generation at kewaunee in the first and second quarters of as a result of an extended outage 
steam fuel expense at wpsc was higher by million and combustion turbine generation expense was higher by million due to increased generation requirements from these sources during the extended outage at kewaunee 
wpsr consolidated purchased power expense increased million  or  primarily due to increased purchase requirements and higher costs of purchased power at wpsc during the extended outage at kewaunee 
the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of fuel and purchased power  within a specified range  on to its customers through a fuel adjustment clause 
wpsc is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annual basis 
the additional fuel costs in did not result in wpsc being outside this window 
gas utility operations wpsc wpsr consolidated gas margin increased million  or  primarily due to wpsc s implementation of a pscw rate order which authorized a million  or  increase in gas revenues 
gas operating revenues remained relatively stable reflecting the rate increase offset by a reduction in heating degree days 
gas revenues also reflect a one time reduction of million in the first quarter of as a result of a pscw directive to change the accounting treatment for previous customer line extensions 
this reduction represented a decrease of approximately 
per share after income tax effects 
gas purchase costs showed a net decrease of million  or  primarily due to reduced purchases because of decreased demand as a result of the reduction in heating degree days 
the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a pgac 
other utility expenses income wpsc and uppco other operating expenses at wpsc decreased million  or 
cost saving initiatives and decreased amortization of deferred demand side management expenditures resulted in lower customer service and sales expenses of million 
administrative expenses decreased million due to cost saving measures and reduced postretirement medical  dental  and other benefit expenses 
generation operating expenses were lower by million primarily as a result of the completion in of an amortization of deferred expenses related to a previous coal contract settlement 
gas operating expenses decreased million as the result of a pscw directive requiring gas servicing revenues and expenses to be classified as other income and deductions beginning in maintenance expense at wpsc decreased million  or 
electric transmission and distribution expenses decreased million as a result of cost saving initiatives and less maintenance of overhead lines in due to less storm damage 
maintenance expenses were million lower at kewaunee in because kewaunee was out of service in for scheduled maintenance 
gas distribution expenses were lower by million due to cost saving initiatives and decreased maintenance activities 
steam costs decreased million at wpsc s coal fired plants due to changes in maintenance schedules as a result of the extended outage at kewaunee 
depreciation and decommissioning expenses at wpsc increased million  or  largely due to the accelerated recovery of investment in kewaunee and accelerated funding of kewaunee decommissioning costs 
other income at wpsc increased million  or  primarily due to gains in on the sale of nonutility property of million which represented an increase of approximately 
per share after income tax effects 
also included in other income in was interest of million resulting from an income tax audit settlement 
income tax expense increased million reflecting higher net income in overview of nonregulated operations nonregulated operations experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in operating losses at the nonregulated subsidiaries were anticipated by management as the companies developed infrastructure and financed additional working capital needed to support growth 
losses were also incurred at the wpsr holding company in due to expenses incurred as a result of the merger with upen 
overview of wps energy services  inc 
revenues at esi were million in compared with million in  an increase of 
esi incurred a loss of million in and a loss of million in nonregulated margins esi gas margins at esi were a positive million in and a negative million in  an increase of million 
in  customer commitments at esi were not fully hedged during a period of volatile gas commodity markets and certain gas suppliers defaulted which negatively impacted margins 
electric margins at esi increased million in gas sales at esi increased million in  or  as a result of customer growth 
electric sales at esi increased million in  or  also as a result of customer growth 
gas purchases and purchased power expense increased million and million  respectively  in other nonregulated expenses income esi other operating expenses at esi increased million  or  due to expansion of the business and the development of infrastructure as esi positions itself for the future 
although increased margins more than offset other operating expenses  interest costs increased due to the financing of additional working capital needed to support the growth of esi 
esi experienced trading losses of million in and million in other nonregulated operations pdi incurred a loss of million in and a loss of million in other operating expenses at pdi increased million as a result of expansion of the business and operation of the stoneman power plant stoneman 
project revenues at pdi partially offset costs related to the investigation of possible energy related investments and a loss from stoneman operations 
pdi also experienced a loss of million in related to the write off of an investment in an industrial processing facility 
this write off represented a decrease in earnings of 
per share after income tax effects 
other operating expenses at wpsr increased million in due to expenses associated with the upen merger 
balance sheet wpsr compared with nuclear decommissioning trusts increased million due to continued funding and favorable investment returns 
construction in progress increased million largely as a result of construction expenditures related to the kewaunee steam generator replacement project  the combustion turbine project at west marinette  and the transmission line for the de pere energy center project 
customer receivables increased million primarily as a result of increased sales at esi 
net nonutility and nonregulated plant increased million as a result of the acquisition of additional assets at pdi 
investments and other assets increased million primarily due to an increased unrealized gain on the nuclear decommissioning trust at wpsc and an increased unrealized loss on hedging activities at esi 
commercial paper increased million due to increased operational cash needs at wpsc and wpsr 
cash requirements exceeded internally generated funds at both wpsc and wpsr 
accounts payable increased million due to increased payables at wpsc related to the kewaunee refueling outage and other construction projects  and higher payables at esi as a result of increased sales activity 
financial condition wpsr investments and financing wpsr made a million equity infusion into wpsc during the second quarter of wpsc retired million of first mortgage bonds on july  and issued million of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds on december  a special common stock dividend of million was paid by wpsc to wpsr in december the special dividend allowed wpsc s average equity capitalization ratio to remain at approximately  the level approved by the pscw for ratemaking 
short term borrowings increased million during as a result of cash requirements in excess of internally generated funds 
pretax interest coverage was times for the months ended december  for wpsc 
wpsc s bond ratings are aa standard poor s and duff phelps and aa moody s 
wpsr will use internally generated funds and short term borrowing to satisfy most of its capital requirements 
wpsr may periodically issue additional long term debt and common stock to reduce short term debt and to maintain desired capitalization ratios 
the specific forms of financing  amounts  and timing will depend on the availability of projects  market conditions  and other factors 
at this time  however  it is anticipated that common stock will be issued by wpsr in mid wpsr began issuing new shares of common stock for the stock investment plan in january wpsr may also expand its leveraged employee stock ownership plan during the next three year period 
wpsc makes large investments in capital assets 
construction expenditures for wpsc are expected to be approximately million in the aggregate for the through period 
this includes expenditures for the replacement of kewaunee steam generators 
in addition  other capital requirements for wpsc for the three year period will include kewaunee decommissioning trust fund contributions of million 
wpsc s agreement to purchase electricity from the de pere energy center  a gas fired cogeneration facility  will be accounted for as a capital lease 
the de pere energy center lease will be capitalized at million in while not a capital expenditure  this will affect the capital structure 
uppco will incur construction expenditures of about million in the aggregate for the period through  primarily for electric distribution improvements 
investment expenditures for nonregulated projects are uncertain since there are few firm commitments at this time 
approximately million will be incurred in to purchase generating units located in the state of maine and the canadian province of new brunswick 
financing for most nonregulated projects is expected to be obtained through a new subsidiary  wps resources capital corporation  which was formed in january to obtain funding for those projects 
on july   wpsr capital trust i trust  a delaware business trust of which wpsr owns all of the outstanding million trust common securities  issued million of trust preferred securities to the public 
the sole asset of the trust is million of wpsr subordinated debentures due in the terms and interest payments on these debentures correspond to the terms and distributions on the trust preferred securities 
regulatory wpsc received a rate order in the wisconsin jurisdiction on january  the impact is a million increase in electric revenues and a million increase in gas revenues on an annual basis 
the new rates will be effective for and the pscw authorized a return on wpsc equity for and merger on september   upen merged with and into wpsr  and uppco  upen s utility subsidiary  became a wholly owned subsidiary of wpsr 
the exchange of stock qualifies as a tax free transaction and the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
kewaunee on september   wpsc and madison gas and electric company mg e finalized an arrangement in which wpsc will acquire mg e s share of kewaunee 
this agreement  the closing of which is contingent upon regulatory approvals and steam generator replacement scheduled for the spring of  will give wpsc ownership in kewaunee 
the arrangement provides that the book value of mg e s share of kewaunee at the time of the transfer could be credited against the purchase price of a planned megawatt  natural gas fired  combustion turbine electric generation station to be built near marinette  wisconsin 
wpsc had previously agreed to build this station for mg e 
if  for some reason  the marinette station is not completed  the arrangement calls for wpsc to pay for mg e s share of kewaunee with a combination of cash and notes 
mg e has agreed to retain certain of its obligations related to the period of time that it had been an owner of kewaunee 
mg e will effectively transfer its nuclear decommissioning funds to wpsc to pay for mg e s share of the currently estimated decommissioning costs of the plant at the closing for the asset swap 
wpsc and wisconsin power and light company  the joint owners of the plant after the described change in ownership  will be responsible for the decommissioning of the plant 
year compliance the year issue arises because software programs  computer hardware  and equipment that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this may result in system failures or other disruptions of operations 
wpsr and its subsidiary companies are committed to eliminating or minimizing adverse effects of the year computer compliance issue on their business operations  including the products and services provided to customers  and to maintaining wpsr s reputation as an efficient and reliable supplier of energy 
wpsr  however  is unable to guarantee that there will be no adverse effects as a result of the year computer compliance issue because many aspects of compliance are beyond wpsr s direct control 
wpsr has undertaken a program to assess year compliance and to bring computer systems into compliance by the year all systems  including energy production and delivery systems  other embedded systems  and third party systems of suppliers are being evaluated to identify and resolve potential problems 
a year project plan which includes awareness  inventory and assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation has been developed 
the formal awareness phase of the year project which includes understanding and communication of the issue to employees  customers  suppliers  and other affected parties has essentially been completed 
the year issue has been communicated to wpsr employees and customers via several media 
all wpsr business unit leaders have been made aware of the year project plan and their roles in implementing the plan 
communication and response to year inquiries continue 
the inventory and assessment phase which includes identification of all information and non information technology systems and of non compliant systems  applications  and hardware  has been completed 
action plans for remediation  which includes modifications to bring systems into compliance  and action plans for testing including validation of compliance have been completed 
modifications of major in house supported systems to correct year problems have been underway since wpsr s information technology department has identified five major systems 
all of these systems customer information  finance  human resources  materials management  and facility management are currently year compliant 
in addition  non information technology systems have been identified and ranked as to the risk posed by non compliance 
non information technology systems include computer and embedded systems related to wpsr s power plant operating  system operating  hydraulic  transmission  and other operating functions 
all systems ranked as critical  severe  or high are scheduled to be year compliant by the end of the first quarter of wpsr has hired an external consulting group to monitor the progress of its year compliance activities 
the consulting group s responsibilities include performing a status check on wpsr s ability to achieve year compliance 
in addition  wpsr is identifying  contacting  and assessing suppliers and other business partners for year readiness  as these external parties may have the potential to impact wpsr s year readiness 
wpsr is also working to address year issues related to all joint ownership facilities 
at the present time  wpsr is not aware of problems that would materially impact the company s operations 
however  wpsr has no means of ensuring that all third parties will be year compliant in a timely manner  and the inability of these parties to resolve successfully their year issues could have a material impact on the operations of wpsr s subsidiaries 
due to fewer expenditures for hardware and software than originally anticipated  the estimate of total year project costs has been reduced to million 
this estimate is considered reasonable and has been approved for rate recovery by the pscw 
this estimate includes internal labor costs of million  software replacement costs for non compliant products of million  and contract labor costs of million 
expenditures for the year project incurred through december   are million 
major expenditures for hardware  software  and other equipment were made in the fourth quarter of and additional expenditures will be made in the first quarter of the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or the failure of  certain normal business activities or operations which could materially affect wpsr s results of operations 
however  due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  wpsr is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on operations 
a preliminary identification of potential risks related to the failure to be in compliance by the year has been made 
a better understanding of actual risks will be developed during the remediation  testing  and contingency planning processes 
the development of wpsr s contingency planning process is intended to minimize the problems associated with these risks 
wpsr is assessing the potential impact of failure to achieve year compliance with respect to each of the following generation availability system monitoring and control functions ability to restart generators that are out of service for planned or unplanned outages company owned voice data communications transmission facilities system protection critical operating data ie  generation plant data electric and gas distribution systems pipelines constraints to the supply or pressure of natural gas major support systems contingency plans for dealing with year issues will be developed by april for each application that has been identified as critical or severe 
in addition  a proposal for a quick response team concept has been drafted  and a process for handling unexpected year problems will be formalized in early a most reasonably likely worst case year scenario will be identified and addressed by a crisis management team in early the team plans to conduct a crisis management drill using a year scenario 
trends wpsr accounting standards wpsc and uppco follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and their financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating each utility 
for wpsc these include the pscw  of revenues  the michigan public service commission mpsc  of revenues  and the ferc  of revenues 
in addition  kewaunee is regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission 
environmental matters are primarily governed by the united states environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires all derivatives to be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative is dependent upon the use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met  changes in the derivative s fair value must be recognized currently in earnings 
this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  wpsr will be adopting the requirements of this statement on january   and has not yet determined the method of adoption or its impact 
however  the requirements of this statement could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement requires the capitalization of certain costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use 
the statement is effective for periods beginning after december  wpsr will be adopting the requirements of this statement in january although the total impact of wpsr s adoption of this statement has not been determined  wpsc s adoption of this statement is expected to result in a reduction in operating expenses which will be considered in the ratemaking process 
the capitalized software costs will then be charged to amortization expense in future years 
in april  the aicpa issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this statement provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up costs and organization costs 
costs of start up activities and organization costs are required to be expensed as incurred 
the statement is effective for periods beginning after december  wpsr will be adopting the requirements of this statement in and does not anticipate any material impact to its financial statements 
utility restructuring electric reliability issues have replaced restructuring and retail competition issues in wisconsin  and the pscw announced that its first priority is to develop the utility infrastructure necessary to assure reliable electric service and to remove the barriers to competition at the wholesale level 
in  the pscw and the major utilities in wisconsin  including wpsc  made legislative proposals to address reliability and restructuring concerns  including market power  among other issues 
this resulted in the electric reliability bill wis 
laws act 
act contains provisions which relate to the planning and approval by the pscw of electric power generation and transmission facilities  the regional management of the transmission system  new electric power generation  including the ownership and operation of wholesale merchant plants  new electric power transmission facilities  out of state retail electric sales  service standards for electric generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  and the allowable assets of public utility holding companies 
on june   the mpsc ordered utilities under its jurisdiction to file electric open access plans and related tariffs 
the mpsc order called for generation open access in increments of of retail load each year starting in and ending in the mpsc order requires full generation open access for retail load in wpsc and uppco submitted plans which provide retail open access starting in when the mpsc order requires open access for of retail load 
the plans then continue on the mpsc schedule including full open access in should electric deregulation occur such that wpsc and uppco would no longer qualify to reflect the effects of ratemaking under sfas no 
in their financial statements  no impairment of significant recorded assets or reduction in reported equity is anticipated 
wpsc and uppco do not have any significant assets which are foreseen as being potentially stranded and no potential disparity between the depreciable lives of capital assets and those lives applicable to a competitive environment has been identified 
increased competition is likely to put pressure on electric utility margins 
at this time  however  management cannot predict the ultimate results of deregulation 
part of electric utility restructuring involves establishing independent system operators isos 
an iso is an independent third party which potentially owns the transmission facilities  oversees the operations of transmission facilities  administers open access transmission tariffs  and directs power dispatch 
wpsc is working with several groups which are attempting to form isos 
both the pscw and the mpsc continue to review gas industry restructuring 
in a current docket  the pscw is addressing gas restructuring issues including unbundling of rates  pricing of contracted services in potential utility bypass situations  and the separation of gas utilities from their nonregulated gas marketing affiliates

wpsc has historically recovered gas costs through a pgac 
the pscw has recently allowed utilities to select either an incentive gas cost recovery mechanism or a modified one for one mechanism for gas cost recovery 
wpsc has selected the modified one for one gas cost recovery plan  and implementation of the new mechanism  which is similar to the recovery received under the existing pgac  began in january environmental wpsc continues to investigate the environmental cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites 
the cleanup of wpsc s stevens point manufactured gas plant site has been substantially completed with monitoring of the site continuing 
costs of this cleanup were within the range expected for this site 
future investigation and cleanup costs for the remaining seven sites is estimated to be in the range of million to million 
these estimates may be adjusted in the future contingent upon remedial technology  regulatory requirements  and experience gained through cleanup activities 
an initial liability for cleanup of million had been established with an offsetting regulatory asset deferred charge 
of this amount  approximately million has been spent to date 
management believes that cleanup costs net of insurance recoveries  but not the carrying costs associated with the cleanup expenditures  will be recoverable in current and future customer rates

kewaunee on september   wpsc and mg e finalized an arrangement in which wpsc will acquire mg e s share of kewaunee 
this agreement  the closing of which is contingent upon regulatory approval and steam generator replacement scheduled for the spring of  will give wpsc ownership in kewaunee 
on october   kewaunee was shut down for a planned maintenance and refueling outage 
inspection of the plant s two steam generators showed that the repairs made in were holding up well and few additional repairs were needed 
in addition to the inspection and repair of the steam generators  a major overhaul was performed on the main turbine generator 
the plant was back in operation on november  nonregulated activities esi incurred a million loss in and a million loss in a primary strategy for esi is to gain market presence which is reflected in a growth in revenues during the three year period through  from million in to million in to support this growth  significant expenditures were made for personnel additions and system improvements 
these expenditures  coupled with extreme gas market volatility  contributed to the losses incurred at esi 
gas market volatility was reflected in the nymex gas futures prices per dekatherm which  in  ranged from a high of to a low of 
in  gas futures prices ranged from a high of to a low of 
gas market volatility has a direct impact on revenue and trading income 
pdi expects to improve the overall performance of its investment in stoneman due to a multi year capacity sales agreement 
stoneman was also grandfathered by the pscw as a merchant plant which increases the probability that pdi will repower the plant as a megawatt to megawatt gas fired combined cycle generating facility 
operational problems related to the bonding process at eco coal pelletization  llc are being addressed with expected resolution before the second quarter of impact of inflation wpsr wpsr s current financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and report operating results in terms of historic cost 
they provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
under rate treatment prescribed by utility regulatory commissions  wpsc s and uppco s projected operating costs are recoverable in revenues 
because forecasts are prepared assuming inflation  the majority of inflationary effects on normal operating costs are recoverable in rates 
however  in these forecasts  wpsc and uppco are only allowed to recover the historic cost of plant via depreciation 
results of operations wisconsin public service corporation wpsc is a regulated electric and gas utility 
electric operations accounted for of revenues  while gas contributed to revenues 
compared with wisconsin public service corporation overview revenues at wpsc were million in compared with million in  a decrease of 
earnings were million in and million in  a decrease of 
the primary reasons for the decrease in earnings at wpsc were the impact of unusually warm winter weather  increased maintenance expenses  a decrease in other income  an increase in other operating expenses  and a decrease in the gas margin 
partially offsetting these factors were an increase in the electric utility margin and a decrease in interest expense 
electric utility operations wpsc s electric utility margins increased million  or  primarily due to increased kwh sales of to wpsc customers as a result of a increase in cooling degree days in partially offsetting the increase in electric margins in was the impact of a pscw rate order on wpsc which was effective for the entire year in but was only effective in for the period after february  this order authorized an electric revenue reduction 
wpsc electric margins thousands revenues    fuel and purchased power    margin    sales in kwh thousands    electric utility revenues increased million  or  largely due to increased revenues of million from wpsc s wholesale customers and million from wpsc s commercial and industrial customers as a result of the warmer weather 
also included in electric revenues are surcharge revenues at wpsc of million related to the recovery of the deferred costs for the kewaunee steam generator repairs 
partially offsetting these increases to revenues were the electric rate reduction and a million refund of wpsc s transmission revenues as the result of a ferc settlement related to open access transmission tariff rates 
electric production fuel expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of increased generation expense 
kewaunee was out of service for the first six months of as the result of an extended outage to repair steam generators  thus  in comparison  the higher generation expense in purchased power expense decreased million  or  primarily due to decreased purchase requirements in the first half of purchase requirements in the first half of were higher due to lack of production at kewaunee in the first and second quarters of as a result of an extended outage 
also contributing to lower purchased power expense was a million credit to purchased power expense in the fourth quarter of related to the settlement of litigation involving a contract with a power supplier 
the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of fuel and purchased power  within a specified range  on to its customers through a fuel adjustment clause 
gas utility operations wpsc s gas margin decreased million in  or  primarily due to a reduction in heating degree days 
wpsc gas margins thousands revenues    purchase costs    margin    volume in therms thousands    gas operating revenues decreased million  or 
this decrease was due to unusually mild weather in resulting in lower gas therm sales for of 
also contributing to the decrease in gas operating revenues was a reduction in revenues of million for refunds from anr pipeline company which wpsc passed on to its gas customers in the second quarter of gas purchase costs decreased million  or 
this decrease was due to reduced customer demand as a result of the mild weather during also contributing to the decrease in gas costs was a million refund from anr pipeline company which was credited to gas expense in the second quarter of under current regulatory practice  the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a pgac 
other utility expenses income other operating expenses at wpsc increased million  or  primarily due to higher benefit costs in maintenance expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of increased expenses at kewaunee during the second and fourth quarters of this increase was partly due to the recognition in the second quarter of of the deferred expenses for kewaunee steam generator repairs 
the pscw approved deferral of the repairs in  the cost of which has been collected in the second quarter of through a million electric revenue surcharge 
in addition  maintenance expense at kewaunee increased in the fourth quarter of due to a scheduled refueling outage 
depreciation and decommissioning expenses increased million  or  due to an increased plant base and to the accelerated recovery of investment in kewaunee and accelerated funding of kewaunee decommissioning costs 
accelerated recovery of investment and funding began on february  and  therefore  was effective for all of but only a portion of other income decreased million  or  primarily due to one time gains on sales of nonutility property which occurred in these gains represented an increase in earnings for of approximately per share 
compared with wisconsin public service corporation overview revenues at wpsc were million in compared with million in  a decrease of 
earnings were million in and million in  an increase of 
the primary reasons for the increase in earnings were a decrease in operating and maintenance expenses  an increase in other income  and an increase in the gas utility margin 
offsetting these factors were a decrease in the electric utility margin  an increase in depreciation and decommissioning expense  and an increase in income tax expense 
electric utility operations wpsc s electric utility margins decreased million  or  primarily due to implementation of a pscw rate order which authorized a million  or  electric revenue reduction 
a second factor contributing to decreased margins was increased replacement power costs as a result of an extended outage at kewaunee 
a surcharge authorized by the pscw partially offset increases in replacement power costs in the latter part of the first quarter and in the second quarter of in spite of a decrease in cooling degree days  electric kwh sales increased by primarily due to increased demand by wpsc s commercial and industrial customers 
commercial and industrial kwh sales increased  while wholesale kwh sales decreased 
electric operating revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to the electric rate decrease 
electric production fuel expense increased million  or 
nuclear fuel expense was million lower than in due to decreased generation at kewaunee in the first and second quarters of as a result of an extended outage 
steam fuel expense was higher by million and combustion turbine generation expense was higher by million due to increased generation requirements from these sources during the extended outage at kewaunee 
purchased power expense increased million  or  primarily due to increased purchase requirements and higher costs of purchased power during the extended outage at kewaunee 
the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of fuel and purchased power  within a specified range  on to its customers through a fuel adjustment clause 
wpsc is required to file an application to adjust rates either higher or lower when costs are plus or minus from forecasted costs on an annual basis 
the additional fuel costs in did not result in wpsc being outside this window 
gas utility operations wpsc s gas margin increased million  or  primarily due to the implementation of a pscw rate order which authorized a million  or  increase in gas revenues 
gas operating revenues remained relatively stable reflecting the rate increase offset by a reduction in heating degree days 
gas revenues also reflect a one time reduction of million in the first quarter of as a result of a pscw directive to change the accounting treatment for previous customer line extensions 
this reduction represented a decrease of approximately 
per share after income tax effects 
gas purchase costs showed a net decrease of million  or  primarily due to reduced purchases because of decreased demand as a result of the reduction in heating degree days 
the pscw allows wpsc to pass changes in the cost of gas on to customers through a pgac 
other utility expenses income other operating expenses decreased million  or 
cost saving initiatives and decreased amortization of deferred demand side management expenditures resulted in lower customer service and sales expenses of million 
administrative expenses decreased million due to cost saving measures and reduced postretirement medical  dental  and other benefit expenses 
generation operating expenses were lower by million primarily as a result of the completion in of an amortization of deferred expenses related to a previous coal contract settlement 
gas operating expenses decreased million as the result of a pscw directive requiring gas servicing revenues and expenses to be classified as other income and deductions beginning in maintenance expense decreased million  or 
electric transmission and distribution expenses decreased million as a result of cost saving initiatives and less maintenance of overhead lines in due to less storm damage 
maintenance expenses were million lower at kewaunee in because kewaunee was out of service in for scheduled maintenance 
gas distribution expenses were lower by million due to cost saving initiatives and decreased maintenance activities 
steam costs decreased million at wpsc s coal fired plants due to changes in maintenance schedules as a result of the extended outage at kewaunee 
depreciation and decommissioning expenses increased million  or  largely due to the accelerated recovery of investment in kewaunee and accelerated funding of kewaunee decommissioning costs 
other income increased million  or  primarily due to gains in on the sale of nonutility property of million which represented an increase of approximately 
per share after income tax effects 
also included in other income in was interest of million resulting from an income tax audit settlement 
income tax expense increased million reflecting higher net income in balance sheet wpsc compared with nuclear decommissioning trusts increased million due to continued funding and favorable investment returns 
construction in progress increased million largely as a result of construction expenditures related to the kewaunee steam generator replacement project  the combustion turbine project at west marinette  and the transmission line for the de pere energy center project 
commercial paper increased million due to increased operational cash needs at wpsc 
cash requirements exceeded internally generated funds 
accounts payable increased million due to increased payables related to the kewaunee refueling outage and other construction projects  and other long term liabilities increased million due to an increased liability for postretirement health care and higher deposits from the joint owners of kewaunee as a result of the refueling outage 
financial condition wpsc investments and financing wpsr made a million equity infusion in wpsc during the second quarter of wpsc retired million of first mortgage bonds on july  and issued million of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds on december  a special common stock dividend of million was paid by wpsc to wpsr in december the special dividend allowed wpsc s average equity capitalization ratio to remain at approximately  the level approved by the pscw for ratemaking 
short term borrowings increased million during as a result of cash requirements in excess of internally generated funds 
pretax interest coverage was times for the months ended december  wpsc s bond ratings are aa standard poor s and duff phelps and aa moody s 
wpsc makes large investments in capital assets 
construction expenditures for wpsc are expected to be approximately million in the aggregate for the through period 
this includes expenditures for the replacement of kewaunee steam generators 
in addition  other capital requirements for wpsc for the three year period include kewaunee decommissioning trust fund contributions of million 
wpsc s agreement to purchase electricity from the de pere energy center  a gas fired cogeneration facility  will be accounted for as a capital lease 
the de pere energy center lease will be capitalized at million in at the same time  a capital lease obligation of the same amount will be recorded which will affect wpsc s capital structure 
regulatory wpsc received a rate order in the wisconsin jurisdiction on january  the impact is a million increase in electric revenues and a million increase in gas revenues on an annual basis 
the new rates will be effective for and the pscw authorized a return on wpsc equity for and kewaunee on september   wpsc and mg e finalized an arrangement in which wpsc will acquire mg e s share of kewaunee 
this agreement  the closing of which is contingent upon regulatory approvals and steam generator replacement scheduled for the spring of  will give wpsc ownership in kewaunee 
the arrangement provides that the book value of mg e s share of kewaunee at the time of the transfer could be credited against the purchase price of a planned megawatt  natural gas fired  combustion turbine electric generating station to be built near marinette  wisconsin 
wpsc had previously agreed to build this station for mg e 
if  for some reason  the marinette station is not completed  the arrangement calls for wpsc to pay for mg e s share of kewaunee with a combination of cash and notes 
mg e has agreed to retain certain of its obligations related to the period of time that it had been an owner of kewaunee 
mg e will effectively transfer its nuclear decommissioning funds to wpsc to pay for mg e s share of the currently estimated decommissioning costs of the plant at the closing for the asset swap 
wpsc and wisconsin power and light company  the joint owners of the plant after the described change in ownership  will be responsible for the decommissioning of the plant 
year compliance the year issue arises because software programs  computer hardware  and equipment that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this may result in system failures or other disruptions of operations 
wpsc is committed to eliminating or minimizing adverse effects of the year computer compliance issue on its business operations  including the products and services provided to customers  and to maintaining wpsc s reputation as an efficient and reliable supplier of energy 
wpsc  however  is unable to guarantee that there will be no adverse effects as a result of the year computer compliance issue because many aspects of compliance are beyond wpsc s direct control 
wpsc has undertaken a program to assess year compliance and to bring computer systems into compliance by the year all systems  including energy production and delivery systems  other embedded systems  and third party systems of suppliers are being evaluated to identify and resolve potential problems 
a year project plan which includes awareness  inventory and assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation has been developed 
the formal awareness phase of the year project which includes understanding and communication of the issue to employees  customers  suppliers  and other affected parties has essentially been completed 
the year issue has been communicated to wpsc employees and customers via several media 
all wpsc business unit leaders have been made aware of the year project plan and their roles in implementing the plan 
communication and response to year inquiries continue 
the inventory and assessment phase which includes identification of all information and non information technology systems and of non compliant systems  applications  and hardware  has been completed 
action plans for remediation  which include modifications to bring systems into compliance  and action plans for testing including validation of compliance have been completed 
modifications of major in house supported systems to correct year problems have been underway since wpsc s information technology department has identified five major systems 
all of these systems customer information  finance  human resources  materials management  and facility management are currently year compliant 
in addition  non information technology systems have been identified and ranked as to the risk posed by non compliance 
non information technology systems include computer and embedded systems related to wpsc s power plant operating  system operating  hydraulic  transmission  and other operating functions 
all systems ranked as critical  severe  or high are scheduled to be year compliant by the end of the first quarter of wpsc has hired an external consulting group to monitor the progress of its year compliance activities 
the consulting group s responsibilities include performing a status check on wpsc s ability to achieve year compliance 
in addition  wpsc is identifying  contacting  and assessing suppliers and other business partners for year readiness  as these external parties may have the potential to impact wpsc s year readiness 
wpsc is also working to address year issues related to all joint ownership facilities 
at the present time  wpsc is not aware of problems that would materially impact the company s operations 
however  wpsc has no means of ensuring that all third parties will be year compliant in a timely manner  and the inability of these parties to successfully resolve their year issues could have a material impact on company operations 
due to fewer expenditures for hardware and software than originally anticipated  the estimate of total year project costs has been reduced to million 
this estimate is considered reasonable and has been approved for rate recovery by the pscw 
this estimate includes internal labor costs of million  software replacement costs for non compliant products of million  and contract labor costs of million 
expenditures for the year project incurred through december   are million 
major expenditures for hardware  software  and other equipment were made in the fourth quarter of and additional expenditures will be made in the first quarter of the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or the failure of  certain normal business activities or operations which could materially affect wpsc s results of operations 
however  due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  wpsc is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on operations 
a preliminary identification of potential risks related to the failure to be in compliance by the year has been made 
a better understanding of actual risks will be developed during the remediation  testing  and contingency planning processes 
the development of wpsc s contingency planning process is intended to minimize the problems associated with these risks 
wpsc is assessing the potential impact of failure to achieve year compliance with respect to each of the following generation availability system monitoring and control functions ability to restart generators that are out of service for planned or unplanned outages company owned voice data communications transmission facilities system protection critical operating data ie  generation plant data electric and gas distribution systems pipelines constraints to the supply or pressure of natural gas major support systems contingency plans for dealing with year issues will be developed by april for each application that has been identified as critical or severe 
in addition  a proposal for a quick response team concept has been drafted  and a process for handling unexpected year problems will be formalized in early a most reasonably likely worst case year scenario will be identified and addressed by a crisis management team in early the team plans to conduct a crisis management drill using a year scenario 
trends wpsc accounting standards wpsc follows sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating the utility 
for wpsc these include the pscw  of revenues  the mpsc  of revenues  and the ferc  of revenues 
in addition  kewaunee is regulated by the nuclear regulatory commission 
environmental matters are primarily governed by the united states environmental protection agency and the wisconsin department of natural resources 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires all derivatives to be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative is dependent upon the use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met  changes in the derivative s fair value must be recognized currently in earnings 
this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  wpsc will be adopting the requirements of this statement on january   and has not yet determined the method of adoption or its impact 
however  the requirements of this statement could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
in march  the aicpa issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement requires the capitalization of certain costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use 
the statement is effective for periods beginning after december  wpsc will be adopting the requirements of this statement in january while the total impact of wpsc s adoption of this statement has not been determined  wpsc s adoption of this statement is expected to result in a reduction in operating expenses which will be considered in the ratemaking process 
the capitalized software costs will then be charged to amortization expense in future years 
in april  the aicpa issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this statement provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up costs and organization costs 
costs of start up activities and organization costs are required to be expensed as incurred 
the statement is effective for periods beginning after december  wpsc will be adopting the requirements of this statement in and does not anticipate any material impact to its financial statements 
utility restructuring electric reliability issues have replaced restructuring and retail competition issues in wisconsin  and the pscw announced that its first priority is to develop the utility infrastructure necessary to assure reliable electric service and to remove the barriers to competition at the wholesale level 
in  the pscw and the major utilities in wisconsin  including wpsc  made legislative proposals to address reliability and restructuring concerns  including market power  among other issues 
this resulted in the electric reliability bill wis 
laws act 
act contains provisions which relate to the planning and approval by the pscw of electric power generation and transmission facilities  the regional management of the transmission system  new electric power generation  including the ownership and operation of wholesale merchant plants  new electric power transmission facilities  out of state retail electric sales  service standards for electric generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  and the allowable assets of public utility holding companies 
on june   the mpsc ordered utilities under its jurisdiction to file electric open access plans and related tariffs 
the mpsc order called for generation open access in increments of of retail load each year starting in and ending in the mpsc order requires full generation open access for retail load in wpsc submitted a plan which provides retail open access starting in when the mpsc order requires open access for of retail load 
the plan then continues on the mpsc schedule including full open access in should electric deregulation occur such that wpsc would no longer qualify to reflect the effects of ratemaking under sfas no 
in its financial statements  no impairment of significant recorded assets or reduction in reported equity is anticipated 
wpsc does not have any significant assets which are foreseen as being potentially stranded and no potential disparity between the depreciable lives of capital assets and those lives applicable to a competitive environment has been identified 
increased competition is likely to put pressure on electric utility margins 
at this time  however  management cannot predict the ultimate results of deregulation 
part of electric utility restructuring involves establishing isos 
an iso is an independent third party which oversees the operations of transmission facilities  administers open access transmission tariffs  and directs power dispatch 
wpsc is working with several groups which are attempting to form isos 
both the pscw and the mpsc continue to review gas industry restructuring 
in a current docket  the pscw is addressing gas restructuring issues including unbundling of rates  pricing of contracted services in potential utility bypass situations  and the separation of gas utilities from their nonregulated gas marketing affiliates 
the mpsc is conducting pilot studies to test the development of competitive retail gas markets in michigan
