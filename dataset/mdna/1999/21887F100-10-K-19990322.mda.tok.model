item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview corixa s objective is to be a leader in the discovery and commercialization of products useful in preventing  treating or diagnosing cancer  certain infectious diseases and certain autoimmune diseases 
corixa s strategy is to dedicate its resources to the discovery of vaccines and other antigen based products and to establish corporate collaborations early in the development process for all aspects of product development and commercialization  including research  clinical development  obtaining regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing 
corixa believes that this research and partner driven approach creates significant scientific  operational and financial advantages for the company and accelerates the commercial development of new therapeutic and prophylactic t cell vaccines and other immunotherapeutic products 
as of december   approximately of corixa s revenue has resulted from such collaborative agreements 
in particular  corixa has entered into significant corporate partnerships with sb biologicals and sb manufacturing with respect to tuberculosis  breast cancer and prostate cancer 
in addition  smithkline beecham agreed to provide payment for work that is performed in additional programs in the following areas i ovarian and colon carcinoma vaccine discovery and development programs and ii vaccine discovery programs for two chronic infectious pathogens  chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydia pneumoniae 
the discovery phase of the agreement also allows for the selection of one additional disease field to be agreed upon at a future date 
the company has also granted smithkline beecham an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture  and sell vaccine products resulting from the company s clinical program based on her neu for the treatment of breast and ovarian cancer as well as the company s preclinical program based on mammoglobin  a novel gene product associated with breast cancer 
for certain of these disease areas  the company granted smithkline beecham certain rights to develop  manufacture and sell passive immunotherapy products such as t cell or antibody therapeutics and therapeutic drug monitoring products 
smithkline beecham has committed million to fund work in such discovery programs during the next four years 
additionally  since corixa s inception  approximately of corixa s revenue has resulted from funds awarded through government grants 
as of december   corixa had total stockholders equity of million 
see item business corporate partnerships vaccines 
corixa has entered  and intends to continue to enter  into collaborative agreements early in the development process 
corixa believes that this active corporate partnering strategy enables the company to maintain its focus on its fundamental strengths in vaccine discovery and research  capitalizes on its corporate partners strengths in product development  manufacturing and commercialization  and significantly diminishes corixa s financing requirements 
when entering into such corporate partnering relationships  corixa seeks to cover its research and development expenses through research funding  milestone payments and collaboration agreement credit lines  technology or license fees  while retaining significant downstream participation in product sales through either profit sharing or product royalties paid on annual net sales 
on september   the company completed an acquisition of genquest  inc  a delaware corporation genquest 
the financial statements of corixa corporation include the accounts of its wholly owned subsidiary  chinook  a delaware corporation formerly known as chinook acquisition corporation chinook created to effect the merger with genquest 
pursuant to the terms set forth in the agreement and plan of merger by and among the company  chinook and genquest  genquest merged with and into chinook and the separate corporate existence of genquest ceased  with chinook surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of corixa 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
corixa s income statement for the period in which the acquisition of genquest occurred includes a write off of approximately million or of the purchase price  representing the values determined by management to be attributable to the in process research and development assets associated with the technology acquired in acquisition of genquest 
of this amount  approximately is related to potential diagnostic products  approximately is related to drug screening products and services  approximately is related to gene therapy products  and approximately is related to therapeutic antibody products 
this represents the value ascribed to these programs by corixa s management  based on the discounted cash flows management currently expects from the technologies and genes acquired 
there can be no guarantee  however  that any particular acquired technology will result in a particular product or treatment or that any of the technologies acquired in the acquisition of genquest will result in any products 
see factors affecting future results there are uncertainties related to corixa s early stage of development  there are uncertainties related to corixa s technology and product development  corixa is dependent on existing and future corporate partnerships  and corixa is dependent on in licensed technology 
corixa management believes that the allocation of a majority of the purchase price to these product areas is appropriate because of the future potential that these programs may contribute to the operations of corixa 
in evaluating the acquisition of genquest  corixa management considered a number of factors  including an analysis of genquest that assumed the acquired technology would result in a commercialized product or initial product revenue as early as there can be no assurance  however  that any of such acquired technology will result in product revenue in or at all 
corixa remains focused on the discovery and early clinical development of proprietary vaccine products that induce specific and potent pathogen or tumor reactive t cell responses for the treatment and prevention of cancer  infectious diseases and certain autoimmune diseases 
corixa also intends to broaden its scope to include other strategic relationships that complement its approach to immune system based therapies for cancer  infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases 
corixa has experienced significant operating losses in each year since its inception 
as of december   corixa s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
corixa may incur substantial additional operating losses over  at a minimum  the next several years 
such losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of various costs associated with corixa s discovery  research and development programs and preclinical and clinical activities and the purchase of technology  for example the genquest acquisition 
substantially all of corixa s revenue to date has resulted from corporate partnerships  other research  development and licensing arrangements  research grants and interest income 
corixa s ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations is dependent in large part upon entering into collaborative agreements with corporate partners for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for its products and successfully manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
there can be no assurance that corixa will be able to achieve consistent profitability 
in addition  payments under collaborative agreements and licensing arrangements will be subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amounts  resulting in quarters of profitability and quarters of losses by corixa 
therefore  corixa s results of operations for any period may fluctuate significantly and may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
results of operations fiscal years ended december   and total revenue revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in and from million in this increase was primarily attributable to revenue recognition from the multi field agreement with smithkline beecham 
revenue of approximately million was recognized during the year ended december  in conjunction with the collaboration agreement with genquest 
revenue under government grants received in was million  more than the  received in and down from million in research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in and from million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased payroll and personnel expenses  laboratory services and supplies  increased collaboration and patent expenses  increased consulting costs  and increased deferred compensation costs associated with the amortization of certain stock option grants 
additionally  increased research and development expense for the year ended december  includes the second quarter  charge to reflect a write off of the receivable for warrants issued associated with the genquest collaboration and a  charge in the first quarter to reflect expenses associated with termination of the collaboration with cellpro 
the non cash compensation expense associated with the stock option grant amortization will continue to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of such options  through june research and development expenses of approximately million and million were incurred during the period ended september  the date of the genquest acquisition  and year ended  respectively  in conjunction with the genquest collaboration agreement 
corixa expects research and development expenses to increase in the future to support the expansion of its research and development activities 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from for the same period in and from  in the increase was primarily attributable to increased expenses related to legal fees  business development  and other costs associated with being a public company  and the general and administrative portions of the amortized deferred compensation expense associated with the grant of certain stock options 
corixa expects general and administrative expenses to increase in the future to support the expansion of its business activities 
in process research and development for the year ended december   in process research and development expense reflects the amount allocated to in process technology acquired in the genquest acquisition 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in and from  in this increase resulted from higher average cash balances in compared to as a result of corixa s initial public offering 
interest expense interest expense increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in and from  in the increase was primarily attributable to higher loan and capital lease financing balances 
other income other income decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in and from  in the balance for includes  and  in proceeds from management and administrative services agreements with genquest and idri  respectively 
includes other income of  and  for management and administrative agreements with genquest and idri  respectively 
for  other income consists of  and  in proceeds from genquest and idri  respectively 
the company provides services to idri with respect to corporate management  accounting and financial matters  record keeping  personnel administration and human resources  and treasury services as required by the agreement with idri 
similar services were performed under the genquest agreement  which ended upon the acquisition of genquest by corixa 
deferred compensation amortization of deferred compensation of approximately million and million was recorded in the year ended december  and respectively 
deferred compensation represents the amortization of the difference between the exercise prices of options for  shares of common stock granted during the year ended december  and the deemed fair value of the company s common stock on the grant dates 
the remaining balance of million will be amortized over fiscal years through as the subject options vest 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
if noncompliant systems are not modified  the result could be a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
corixa has largely completed its assessment of its internal systems affected by the year issue and anticipates that it will not be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software to cause its computer systems will properly utilize dates past december  corixa has initiated communications  in the form of questionnaires  with its significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which corixa is vulnerable to those third parties failure to solve their own year issues 
at this time  corixa cannot predict the level of year readiness with respect to its significant suppliers and customers 
corixa intends to continue to monitor the progress of these third parties and will develop contingency plans during the fiscal year in the event corixa becomes aware that one or more of these third parties fails to solve their year issues in such a way as to materially adversely affect the operations of corixa 
the total exposure of the year issue is estimated to be less than  and will be funded through operating cash flows 
to date corixa has not incurred significant costs related to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts in connection with  its year project and the development of a remediation plan 
management does not currently expect corixa s financial condition or results of operations will be materially adversely affected by the year issue 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which corixa s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with corixa s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on corixa 
corixa intends to complete its contingency planning based upon analysis of results of questionnaires received from customers and suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources corixa has financed its operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  collaborative agreements and debt instruments 
the october initial public offering and preceding private placements of equity securities have provided corixa with aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
through december   corixa recognized approximately million of revenue under corporate partnerships and grants and has drawn million on a bank loan and million from credit lines under collaborative agreements 
through december   corixa s operations have used cash of approximately million 
corixa has invested million in property and equipment and has acquired an additional million of equipment through capital lease financings since inception 
corixa expects capital expenditures to increase over the next year as it completes its facility expansion in the first quarter of after that  capital expenditures should stabilize 
during the year ended december   net cash used in corixa s operations was million  compared to  in and million in the increase in cash used by operations was due primarily to an increase in research and development expenses 
investing activities used million  compared to million over the same period in and million in the decrease was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of securities and the million expended to acquire genquest 
as of december   corixa had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million in and million in corixa believes that its existing capital resources  committed payments under its existing collaborative agreements and licensing arrangements  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund its current and planned operations until at least january there is  however  no assurance such sources of capital will be sufficient for such period of time 
corixa intends to enter into additional corporate collaborations that will provide funding for all or a part of corixa s research and development activities 
corixa s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others  continued scientific progress in its discovery  research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of these activities  the ability of corixa to maintain existing  and enter into additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of acquiring companies with complementary technology  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  and the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products and other factors not within corixa s control 
corixa intends to seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements  public or private equity or debt financings  and capital lease transactions 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient capital is not available  corixa may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of its discovery  research or development programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
market risk disclosures interest rate risk the company s line of credit has an interest rate that is based on rates that may fluctuate over time based on economic changes in the us and worldwide financial environment 
the company is subject to interest rate risk  and could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
the company does not expect any change in the interest rates to have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us and european interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments as well as interest paid on debt 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table which follows

corixa is at an early stage in the development of its therapeutic  prophylactic and diagnostic products 
to date  almost all of corixa s revenues have resulted from payments made under agreements with its corporate partners 
corixa expects that most of its revenues for the foreseeable future will continue to result from existing and future corporate partnerships  if any 
corixa has generated only minimal revenues from diagnostic product sales and no revenues from therapeutic product sales since inception 
vaccine products that may result from corixa s research and development programs are not expected to be commercially available for a number of years  if at all 
it will be a number of years  if ever  before corixa will receive any significant revenues from commercial sales of such products 
corixa may not receive anticipated revenues under existing corporate partnerships  and corixa may not be able to enter into any additional corporate partnerships 
thus  corixa may not ever achieve consistent profitability 
there are uncertainties related to corixa s technology and product development 
corixa s technological approach to the development of therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines and other immunotherapeutic products for cancers and certain infectious and autoimmune diseases is unproven in humans 
products based on corixa s technologies are currently in the discovery  preclinical or early clinical investigation stages  and to date  neither corixa nor any of its corporate partners have conducted any clinical trials that incorporate corixa s proprietary microsphere delivery systems or its proprietary adjuvants 
in addition  neither corixa nor any other company has successfully commercialized any therapeutic vaccines for cancer or infectious diseases targeted by corixa 
corixa may not be able to develop successfully effective vaccines for such diseases in a reasonable time frame  if ever  and such vaccines may not be capable of being commercialized 
in addition to its internal development programs  corixa in licenses and acquires technologies to enhance its product pipeline 
any in licensed technologies or technologies acquired as a result of the genquest or anergen merger or otherwise may not prove to be effective or may not result in the successful development of commercial products 
a majority of corixa s programs are currently in the discovery stage or in preclinical development 
only four of corixa s therapeutic vaccine products have advanced to phase i clinical trials 
corixa s vaccines have not been demonstrated to be safe and effective in clinical settings 
corixa s programs may not move beyond their respective current stages of development 
assuming corixa s research does advance  certain preclinical development efforts will be necessary to determine whether any product is safe to enter clinical trials 
under certain of corixa s existing corporate partnerships  the respective corporate partner has primary responsibility for the clinical development of a product 
any such corporate partner may not pursue clinical development in a timely or effective manner  if at all 
if such a product receives authorization from the fda to enter clinical trials  then it may be  and in the case of vaccine products will be  subjected to a multi phase  multi center clinical studies to determine its safety and efficacy 
it is difficult to predict the number or extent of clinical trials required or the period of mandatory patient follow up 
assuming clinical trials of any product are successful and other data are satisfactory  corixa or its applicable corporate partner will submit an application to the fda and appropriate regulatory bodies in other countries to seek permission to market the product 
typically  the review process at the fda takes several years  and the fda may not approve corixa s or its corporate partner s application or may require additional clinical trials or other data prior to approval 
furthermore  even if regulatory approval is ultimately obtained  delays in the approval process could have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  corixa may not be able to produce any products in commercial quantities at a reasonable cost or may not be able to market successfully such products 
corixa is dependent on existing and future corporate partnerships 
the success of corixa s business strategy is largely dependent on its ability to enter into multiple corporate partnerships and to manage effectively the numerous relationships that may exist as a result of this strategy 
corixa has established significant relationships with various corporate partners as of december  for example  in october corixa entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with smithkline beecham for the research  development and commercialization of vaccine products aimed at the prevention and or treatment of tuberculosis  chlamydia trachomatis infection  chlamydia pneumoniae infection  breast cancer  prostate cancer  ovarian cancer and colon cancer 
corixa derived and of its revenues during the year ended december  and the year ended december   respectively  from research and development and other funding under its existing corporate partnerships 
the termination of any of these corporate partnerships would have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of corixa s corporate partners have entered into agreements granting them options to license certain aspects of corixa s technology 
any such corporate partner may not exercise its option to license such technology 
corixa has also entered into corporate partnerships with several companies for the development  commercialization and sale of diagnostic products incorporating corixa s proprietary antigen technology 
any such diagnostic corporate partnership may not ever generate significant revenues 
furthermore  corixa is currently engaged in discussions with a number of pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies with respect to potential corporate partnering arrangements covering various aspects of corixa s technologies 
however  due in part to the early stage of corixa s technologies  the process of establishing corporate partnerships is difficult and time consuming and involves significant uncertainty 
such discussions may not lead to the establishment of any new corporate partnership on favorable terms  or at all 
if established  any such corporate partnership may not result in the successful development of corixa s products or the generation of significant revenues 
because corixa enters into research and development collaborations with corporate partners at an early stage of product development  corixa s success is highly reliant upon the performance of its corporate partners 
under existing corporate partnership arrangements  corixa s corporate partners are generally required to undertake and fund certain research and development activities with corixa  make payments upon achievement of certain scientific milestones and pay royalties or make profit sharing payments when and if a product is commercialized 
corixa does not directly control the amount or timing of resources to be devoted to activities by its existing or future corporate partners 
any of corixa s existing or future corporate partners may not commit sufficient resources to corixa s research and development programs or the commercialization of its products 
if any corporate partner fails to conduct its activities in a timely manner  or at all  corixa s preclinical or clinical development related to such corporate partnership could be delayed or terminated 
corixa s corporate partners may not perform their obligations as expected 
also  corixa s current corporate partners or future corporate partners  if any  may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with corixa 
further  disputes may arise with respect to ownership of technology developed under any such corporate partnership 
finally  any of corixa s current corporate partnerships may be terminated by its corporate partner  and corixa may not be able to negotiate additional corporate partnerships in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
because the success of corixa s business is largely dependent upon its ability to enter into multiple corporate partnerships and to manage effectively the numerous issues that arise from such partnerships  management of these relationships will require significant time and effort from corixa s management team  effective allocation of corixa s resources to multiple projects and an ability to obtain and retain management  scientific and other personnel sufficient to accomplish the foregoing 
corixa s need to manage simultaneously a number of corporate partnerships may not be successful  and the failure to manage effectively such corporate partnerships would have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
corixa s stockholders face potential dilution 
corixa s stockholders will experience immediate and substantial dilution as a result of the shares of corixa common stock issued to anergen stockholders in the merger with anergen  which closed on february  see notes to consolidated financial statements investments 
additional dilution may also occur upon exercise  if at all  of outstanding options and warrants to purchase corixa common stock with an exercise price greater than assumed by corixa in the merger 
additionally  if corixa elects to put the sale of shares of corixa common stock to smithkline beecham biologicals  sa smithkline beecham under the october collaboration and license agreement  corixa will issue additional shares of its common stock to smithkline beecham  which issuance will result in additional dilution to corixa s stockholders 
see part i business corporate partnerships vaccines 
corixa s integration of operations and scientific cultures related to acquisitions may be difficult and lead to adverse effects 
corixa believes that the mergers with genquest see part i business introduction and notes to consolidated financial statements note acquisition of genquest and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations item and anergen see notes to consolidated financial statements investments will result in long term benefits 
these anticipated benefits will depend in part on whether the companies can integrate their operations in an efficient and effective manner 
this may not occur 
integrating distinctive operations and scientific cultures will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process  in addition to direct and indirect transaction costs 
successful integration requires integration of the companies respective research efforts and scientific cultures and coordination of the companies respective business development efforts 
this integration may not be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining operations could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  corixa s business activities 
furthermore  there could be a material adverse effect on employee morale and on the ability of corixa to retain key scientific and managerial personnel 
combining operations may be more difficult because of the necessity to consolidate geographically separate facilities 
if corixa has difficulty integrating the operations of anergen and genquest into corixa  a material adverse effect may result on corixa s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  failure to achieve synergies may lead to a decline in corixa s stock price 
corixa may not manage its growth successfully or integrate successfully potential future acquisitions 
in the future  corixa may make additional acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
managing acquired businesses entails numerous operational and financial risks and strains  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and scientific cultures  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or strategic relationships of acquired entities 
corixa may not be able to manage effectively growth  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
corixa is dependent on in licensed technology 
corixa s success is also dependent on its ability to enter into licensing arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology that is advantageous or necessary to the development and commercialization of corixa s products 
corixa is party to various license agreements that give it rights to use certain technologies in its and its corporate partners discovery  research  development and commercialization activities 
disputes may arise as to the inventorship and corresponding rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by corixa and its licensors or scientific collaborators 
additionally  many of corixa s in licensing agreements contain milestone based termination provisions 
corixa s failure to meet any significant milestones in a particular agreement could allow the licensor to terminate such agreement 
corixa may not be able to negotiate additional license agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  that any of its current license agreements will not be terminated  and it may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of its exclusive licenses 
in the event corixa is unable to obtain or maintain licenses to technology advantageous or necessary to corixa s business  corixa and its corporate partners may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or in license similar technology 
corixa and its corporate partners may not be successful in this regard 
if corixa cannot acquire or develop necessary technology  it may be prevented from commercializing certain of its products 
any such event would have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
corixa is dependent on proprietary technology and its patent protection is uncertain 
corixa s success will depend in part on its ability and that of its corporate partners to obtain and enforce their respective patents and maintain trade secrets  both in the united states and in other countries 
as of january   corixa owned or had licensed issued united states patents that expire at various times between december and august  and pending united states patent applications 
corixa  its corporate partners or its licensors may not have or may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
patents may not issue from any of the pending applications owned or licensed by corixa or its corporate partners 
any claims allowed may not issue  or in the event of issuance  may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to corixa or its corporate partners 
corixa has licensed certain patent applications from sri related to corixa s microsphere encapsulation technology  one of which is currently the subject of an opposition proceeding before the european patent office 
sri may not prevail in this opposition proceeding and patents may not issue in europe related to such technology 
in addition  through its acquisition of anergen  corixa assumed responsibility for a currently pending opposition proceeding directed toward a third party european patent 
there is no guarantee corixa will prevail in this opposition proceeding 
also  corixa s or its corporate partners current patents  or patents that issue on pending applications  may be challenged  invalidated  infringed or circumvented  or the rights granted thereunder may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to corixa 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue and patent applications in certain foreign countries are not generally published until many months or years after they are filed 
publication of technological developments in the scientific and patent literature often occurs long after the date of such developments 
accordingly  corixa cannot be certain that it or one of its corporate partners was the first to invent the subject matter covered by any patent application or that it or one of its corporate partners was the first to file a patent application for any such invention 
patent law relating to the scope and enforceability of claims in the fields in which corixa operates is still evolving 
the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies  including corixa  are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions for which legal principles are not firmly established 
for example  there is substantial uncertainty regarding the potential for patent protection for gene fragments or genes without known function or correlation with specific diseases 
the degree of future protection for corixa s proprietary rights  therefore  is highly uncertain 
in this regard  independent patents may not issue from each of the pending united states patent applications referenced above  which include many interrelated applications directed to common or related subject matter 
in addition  there may be issued patents and pending applications owned by others directed to technologies relevant to corixa s or its corporate partners research  development and commercialization efforts 
corixa s or its corporate partners technology may not be able to be developed and commercialized without a license to such patents 
also  such patent applications may be granted priority over patent applications filed by corixa or one of its corporate partners 
the commercial success of corixa depends significantly on its ability to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties  and corixa s and its corporate partners technologies may  or in the future may  infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
a number of pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  universities and research institutions may have filed patent applications or may have received patent grants that cover technologies similar to the technologies owned  optioned by or licensed to corixa or its corporate partners 
in addition  corixa is unable to determine the patents or patent applications that may materially affect corixa s or its corporate partners ability to make  use or sell any products 
the existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned  optioned by or licensed to corixa or its corporate partners and limit the ability of corixa or its corporate partners to obtain meaningful patent protection 
if patents containing competitive or conflicting claims are issued to third parties  corixa or its corporate partners may be enjoined from pursuing research  development or commercialization of products or be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
corixa or its corporate partners may be so enjoined or may not be able to obtain any license to the patents and technologies of third parties on acceptable terms  if at all 
corixa or its corporate partners may not be able to obtain or develop alternative technologies 
if corixa or any of its corporate partners is enjoined from pursuing its research  development or commercialization activities or if any such license is not  or alternative technologies are not  obtained or developed  corixa or such corporate partner may be delayed or prevented from commercializing its products  which would have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
third parties may independently develop similar or alternative technologies to those of corixa  duplicate any of the technologies of corixa  its corporate partners or its licensors  or design around the patented technologies developed by corixa  its corporate partners or its licensors 
the occurrence of any of these events would have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
litigation may also be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to corixa or its corporate partners or to determine the scope and validity of a third party s proprietary rights 
corixa could incur substantial costs if litigation is required to defend itself in patent suits brought by third parties  if corixa participates in patent suits brought against or initiated by its corporate partners or if corixa initiates such suits 
funds or resources may not be available to corixa in the event of any such litigation 
additionally  corixa or its corporate partners may not prevail in any such action 
an adverse outcome in litigation or an interference to determine priority or other proceeding in a court or patent office could subject corixa to significant liabilities  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties or require corixa or its corporate partners to cease using certain technology  any of which may have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
corixa also relies on trade secrets and proprietary know how  especially in circumstances in which patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable 
corixa attempts to protect its proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and advisors 
these agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual by corixa during the course of the individual s relationship with corixa will be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances 
these agreements also generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to corixa shall be the exclusive property of corixa 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for any breach  and corixa s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by its competitors  any of which could have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
clinical results of acquired technology may not be reproducible 
clinical results from trials of companies acquired  or from technology acquired through in licensing may not be reproducible by the company 
inability to reproduce such clinical results could have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
corixa has a history of operating losses 
corixa has experienced significant operating losses in each year since its inception on september  as of december   corixa s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
corixa may incur substantial additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
such losses have been and may continue to be principally the result of the various costs associated with corixa s discovery  research and development programs  preclinical studies and clinical activities 
substantially all of corixa s revenues to date have resulted from corporate partnerships  other research  development and licensing arrangements  research grants and interest income 
corixa s ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations is dependent in large part upon entering into agreements with corporate partners for product discovery  research  development and commercialization  obtaining regulatory approvals for its products and successfully manufacturing and marketing commercial products 
corixa may not be able to achieve consistent profitability 
in addition  payments under corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements will be subject to significant fluctuations in both timing and amounts  resulting in quarters of profitability and quarters of losses by corixa 
therefore  corixa s results of operations for any period may fluctuate and may not be comparable to the results of operations for any other period 
corixa s need for  and ability to secure  additional funding is uncertain 
the company will require substantial capital resources in order to conduct its operations 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  among others  the following continued scientific progress in its discovery  research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of its discovery  research and development programs  the ability of the company to maintain existing  and establish additional  corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  the potential need to develop  acquire or license new technologies and products  and other factors not within the company s control 
the company intends to seek such additional funding through corporate partnerships  public or private equity or debt financings and capital lease transactions 
additional financing  however  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
additional equity financings could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
if sufficient capital is not available  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of its discovery  research or development programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
corixa believes that following the genquest merger  the company s existing capital resources  committed payments under existing corporate partnerships and licensing arrangements  bank credit arrangements  equipment financing and interest income will be sufficient to fund the company s current and planned operations over at least the next months 
such funds  however  may not be sufficient to meet the capital needs of the company 
in addition  a substantial number of the payments to be made by corixa s corporate partners and other licensors are dependent upon the achievement by corixa of development and regulatory milestones 
failure to achieve such milestones would have a material adverse effect on the company s future capital needs 
corixa is dependent on key personnel 
corixa is highly dependent on the principal members of its scientific and management staff  the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent corixa s achievement of its scientific or business objectives 
competition among biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies for qualified employees is intense  and the ability to retain and attract qualified individuals is critical to corixa s success 
corixa may not be able to attract and retain such individuals currently or in the future on acceptable terms  or at all  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  corixa does not maintain key person life insurance on any officer  employee or consultant of corixa 
corixa also has relationships with scientific collaborators at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at corixa s request or assist corixa in formulating its research and development strategy 
these scientific collaborators are not employees of corixa and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to corixa 
corixa has limited control over the activities of these scientific collaborators and  except as otherwise required by its license  consulting and sponsored research agreements  can expect only limited amounts of time to be dedicated to corixa s activities by such individuals 
failure of any such persons to devote sufficient time and resources to corixa s programs could have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  these collaborators may have arrangements with other companies to assist such companies in developing technologies that may prove competitive to those of corixa 
corixa faces intense competition 
the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive 
several biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies  as well as certain research organizations  currently engage in  or have in the past engaged in  efforts related to the development of vaccines for the treatment and prevention of cancers and various infectious diseases  as well as the development of diagnostic products for infectious disease indications 
many companies  including corixa s corporate partners as well as academic and other research organizations  are also developing alternative therapies to treat cancers  infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases and  in this regard compete with corixa 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to corixa s business may be acquired or licensed by competitors of corixa  thereby preventing corixa from obtaining such technology on favorable terms  or at all 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in discovery  research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than corixa or its corporate partners 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery  research  clinical development and marketing of products similar to those of corixa 
these companies and institutions compete with corixa in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to corixa s programs 
corixa and its corporate partners will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  price and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or may achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than corixa and its corporate partners 
such competitive products may render corixa s products obsolete 
corixa lacks manufacturing experience and relies on contract manufacturers 
corixa does not have significant manufacturing facilities 
although corixa currently manufactures limited quantities of certain antigens and adjuvants  including corixa s novel leif adjuvant  to conduct preclinical studies and to supply corporate partners  corixa intends to rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce large quantities of such substances for clinical trials and product commercialization 
additionally  corixa may be required to rely on contract manufacturers to produce antigens  adjuvants and other components of its products for research and development  preclinical and clinical purposes 
corixa s vaccines and other products have never been manufactured on a commercial scale 
such products may not be able to be manufactured at a cost or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet corixa s needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality 
if corixa is unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products and substances on acceptable terms  or if it should encounter delays or difficulties in its relationships with manufacturers  corixa s preclinical and clinical testing would be delayed  thereby delaying the submission of products for regulatory approval or the market introduction and subsequent sales of such products 
any such delay may have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  contract manufacturers that corixa may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices gmp regulations enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
if the facilities of such manufacturers cannot pass a pre approval plant inspection  the fda premarket approval of corixa s products will not be granted 
corixa lacks marketing experience and is dependent on third parties 
corixa currently has no sales  marketing or distribution capability 
corixa intends to rely on its current and future corporate partners  if any  to market its products 
such corporate partners  however  may not have effective sales forces and distribution systems 
if corixa is unable to maintain or establish such relationships and is required to market any of its products directly  corixa will have to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
corixa may not be able to maintain or establish such relationships with third parties or develop in house sales and distribution capabilities 
to the extent that corixa depends on its corporate partners or third parties for marketing and distribution  any revenues received by corixa will depend upon the efforts of such corporate partners or third parties 
such efforts may not be successful 
corixa faces much government regulation 
the preclinical testing and clinical trials of any products developed by corixa or its corporate partners and the manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution  export or import  marketing  advertising and promotion of any new products resulting therefrom are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  the principal one of which is the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product developed by corixa or its corporate partners must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product in order to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances would adversely affect the marketing of any products developed by corixa or its corporate partners  impose significant additional costs on corixa and its corporate partners  diminish any competitive advantages that corixa or its corporate partners may attain and adversely affect corixa s ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
even after such time and expenditures  any required approvals or clearances may not be obtained for any products developed by or in collaboration with corixa 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for such product  and product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing gmp 
the fda has recently revised the gmp regulations 
the new quality system regulation imposes design controls and makes other significant changes in the requirements applicable to manufacturers 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
corixa is also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals  the environment and the use and disposal of hazardous substances  used in connection with corixa s discovery  research and development work  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents 
in addition  corixa cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations which might have an adverse effect on the discovery  development  production and marketing of corixa s products 
corixa may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
corixa may be adversely affected by the cost of such compliance 
corixa faces product liability exposure and potential unavailability of insurance 
corixa risks financial exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of such products results in personal injury 
corixa may experience losses due to product liability claims in the future 
corixa has obtained limited product liability insurance coverage 
such coverage  however  may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost  or at all 
corixa may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product approved for marketing 
a product liability claim  product recalls or other claim  as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  may have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
corixa s products may not be accepted by the market 
any products successfully developed by corixa or its corporate partners  if approved for marketing  may never achieve market acceptance 
corixa s products  if successfully developed  will compete with a number of traditional drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies  as well as new products currently under development by such companies and others 
the degree of market acceptance of any products developed by corixa or its corporate partners will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidates  their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors 
physicians  patients or the medical community in general may not accept and utilize any products that may be developed by corixa or its corporate partners 
the lack of such market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
corixa faces uncertainty related to pricing and reimbursement and health care reform 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of corixa s or its corporate partners products  if any  will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies and other organizations 
both the federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care  and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products may change or be adopted before any of corixa s or its corporate partners products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that corixa receives for any product it or any of its corporate partners may develop in the future and may have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  including pharmaceuticals 
corixa s or its corporate partners products  if any  may not be considered cost effective or that adequate third party reimbursement will be available to enable corixa or its corporate partners to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on their investment 
in any such event  corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
corixa faces potential volatility in its stock price 
the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies have in the past been  and can in the future be expected to be  especially volatile 
the market price of corixa s common stock may be subject to substantial volatility depending upon many factors  including announcements regarding the results of discovery efforts  preclinical and clinical activities  announcements regarding the acquisition of technologies or companies  including the genquest and anergen mergers  technological innovations or new commercial products developed by corixa or its competitors  changes in government regulations  changes in corixa s patent portfolio  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  changes in existing corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements  establishment of additional corporate partnerships or licensing arrangements  progress of regulatory approvals  issuance of new or changed stock market analyst reports and or recommendations  economic and other external factors  operating losses by corixa  and fluctuations in corixa s financial results and degree of trading liquidity in its common stock 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on corixa s business  financial condition and results of operations and the price of its common stock in the public market 
control by existing stockholders 
as of february   executive officers and directors of corixa  together with entities affiliated with them  beneficially own approximately of the outstanding corixa common stock together with applicable options and warrants held by such stockholders 
the voting power of these stockholders could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of corixa 
for further information refer to the company s proxy statement to be filed within days after the end of the company s fiscal year ended december
