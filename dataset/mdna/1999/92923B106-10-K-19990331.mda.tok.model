item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the primary sources of revenue for wfs are servicing income  net interest income and gain on sale of contracts 
during  wfs purchased billion of contracts compared to billion in  an increase of 
after purchasing contracts  wfs generally securitizes its contracts and earns servicing income 
servicing income is primarily generated following the securitization of contracts purchased by wfs and consists of i contractual servicing fees  ii retained interest income and iii other fee income such as late charges and documentation fees which are earned regardless of whether or not a securitization has occurred 
contractual servicing is the servicing fee contractually due from a trust for servicing contracts which have been securitized 
retained interest income represents realized gross retained interest income from securitized contracts net of the amortization of the risa 
late charges  deferment fees  documentation fees and other fees are also collected on contracts serviced and are retained by the company 
while contracts are held on balance sheet  wfs earns net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on contracts not yet sold in securitization transactions and the interest paid on the liabilities used to fund such contracts 
gain on sale of contracts is recognized based on the estimated present value of the estimated future earnings to be received from the excess spread on securitized contracts at the time of sale 
the company s securitization transactions involved the sale of contracts to a trust in exchange for asset backed securities issued by the trust which wfs sells to investors 
see business hedging and securitization 
wfs continues to service the contracts following their securitization and receives a contractual servicing fee for such activities 
in connection with the securitization of contracts  wfs retains the right to receive excess spread which is equal to the difference between the stated interest rate on the contracts securitized and the interest rate on the asset backed securities  after adjustments for credit losses  administrative expenses and contractual servicing fees 
wfs securitized billion  billion and billion of contracts during  and  respectively 
the following table lists each of the company s outstanding securitization transactions 
each of these transactions was rated aaa by s p  and aaa by moody s  their respective highest ratings

results of operations servicing income servicing income decreased to million during compared to million during and million during  representing a decrease of and a decrease of  respectively 
servicing income declined during due to higher amortization of retained interest in securitized assets as a result of higher credit losses  lower retained interest income as a result of wfs not executing a securitization transaction in the third quarter and  increased levels of bankruptcies 
contractual servicing is earned at a rate of to per annum on the outstanding balance of contracts securitized and is consistent with industry standards 
retained interest income is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold and the size of the serviced portfolio 
servicing fee income is related to the size of the serviced portfolio 
during the past three years  wfs increased its average serviced portfolio to billion in from billion and billion in and  respectively 
other fee income  consisting primarily of documentation fees  late charges and deferment fees  decreased to million during compared to million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease of less than and an increase of  respectively 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands retained interest income    contractual servicing income    other fee income    total servicing income    wfs has completed securitization transactions to date since its first transaction in december the first eleven of these transactions were on balance sheet collateralized bond offerings and the remaining were off balance sheet trusts 
twenty three transactions have been paid in full and all were paid on or before their contractual maturity dates 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between the rate earned on contracts held on balance sheet and the interest costs associated with the company s borrowings 
net interest income totalled million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the following table shows the average rate earned on contracts and the average rate paid on borrowings  consisting primarily of advances from the bank  together with the corresponding net interest rate spread for years ended  and for the year ended december  yield on contracts cost of borrowings net interest rate spread the increase in the net interest rate spread in was the result of lower overall financing costs as wfs utilized the line of credit in order to retain contracts on its balance sheet while obtaining higher yields on those contracts retained 
as wfs securitizes its contracts  revenue previously recognized as net interest income will  upon such securitization  be recognized as retained interest income 
prior to securitizing contracts  wfs earns interest income on its contracts  pays interest expense to fund the contracts and absorbs any credit losses 
after securitization  the net earnings are recorded as retained interest income 
to protect against changes in interest rates  wfs hedges contracts purchased until their securitization with two year treasury securities forward agreements 
the gain or loss on these forward agreements is deferred and included as part of the basis of the underlying contracts and recognized when the contracts are securitized 
see capital resources and liquidity 
the company s primary source of borrowings has been advances from its parent 
these advances were provided on an as needed basis at a weighted average rate equal to in  in and in for  and  the cost of borrowings represents the average combined rate of the senior note  promissory note and the line of credit 
see capital resources and liquidity and transactions with related parties 
gain on sale of contracts wfs recorded gain on sale of contracts of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gain on sale of contracts declined compared to prior periods due to not executing a securitization transaction in the third quarter of  and as a result of changes in the gross interest rate spread of contracts securitized see the table under overview  the amount of dealer participation paid  changes in credit loss assumptions  and the effect of hedging activities 
gross interest rate spread is affected by product mix  general market conditions and overall market interest rates 
the risks inherent in interest rate fluctuation are reduced through hedging activities 
wfs computes a gain on sale with respect to contracts securitized based on the present value of the estimated future retained interest earnings to be received from such contracts using a market discount rate 
two methods have arisen in practice to determine the fair value of these future retained interest earnings  the cash in method and the cash out method 
the securities and exchange commission sec has set forth specific guidance that the cash out method is the only appropriate method to be used in determining the fair value of such assets as defined by the financial accounting standards board statement no 
the cash out method discounts expected future retained interest earnings from the period in which the transferor expects to receive the cash  thereby taking into consideration the period of time that the cash is received from obligors but restricted from distribution to the transferor 
wfs has historically and will continue to use the cash out method in measuring such assets 
in order to determine the gain on sale  wfs also considers prepaid dealer commissions  issuance costs and the effect of hedging activities 
retained interest in securitized contracts is capitalized upon securitization of contracts and represents the present value of the estimated future earnings to be received by wfs from the excess spread created in securitization transactions and is amortized against servicing income over the life of the contracts 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to wfs consolidated financial statements 
provision for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses to cover anticipated losses on the contracts held on balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the contracts held on balance sheet or as a result of the reduction of contracts held on balance sheet due to a securitization transaction 
the level of the allowance is based principally on the outstanding balance of contracts held on balance sheet  pending sales of contracts and historical loss trends 
when wfs sells contracts in a securitization transaction  it reduces its allowance for credit losses and factors potential losses into its gain on sale calculation 
wfs believes that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb inherent losses in the owned contract portfolio 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to wfs consolidated financial statements 
during  the provision for credit losses totaled million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in provision for credit losses in was due primarily to an increased amount of loans held on balance sheet 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of salaries and employee benefits  credit and collections expense and other miscellaneous costs 
over the past three years  these expenses have increased as wfs operations have expanded 
at the end of  wfs operated in seven states 
since  wfs has expanded its operations to include states 
as the servicing portfolio increases  costs related to credit  collection and other related expenses increase as well 
total operating expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company reduced its cost of operations in in both dollars and as a percent of average serviced contracts with the completion of the restructuring programs as well as other operating efficiencies achieved during the year 
operating expenses as a percentage of average serviced contracts declined basis points to in compared with in salaries and employee benefit expenses remained at million in both and  up from million in miscellaneous expenses  which includes occupancy  telephone and other miscellaneous expenses  were million  down and from million and million in and  respectively 
wfs pays a monthly management fee to the bank and westcorp which covers various expenses  including accounting  legal  tax  cash management  purchasing and auditing services 
additionally  the bank and westcorp pay fees to wfs for information services 
the management fee is based upon the actual costs incurred and estimates of actual usage 
wfs believes that the management fee approximates the cost to perform these services on its own behalf or to acquire them from third parties 
wfs has the option  under the management agreements  to procure these services on its own should it be more economically beneficial to wfs to do so 
see transactions with related parties management agreements 
restructuring in  the company completed a restructuring plan initially announced on february  the plan had four objectives to reduce operating costs  to increase contract production volume  to strengthen credit quality and to improve the quality of personnel 
the plan was achieved in two phases 
phase i of the plan  completed in the first quarter of  consisted of the restructuring of operations in the western united states 
phase ii of the plan  completed in the third quarter of and patterned after phase i  consisted of the restructuring of operations in the central and eastern united states 
as a result of the restructuring  a total of positions  or of the company s workforce  were eliminated and offices were closed 
the company now purchases contracts through regional business centers rbcs and satellite offices  each offering the full spectrum of prime and non prime products 
the total pre tax restructuring charge in for the completed plan was million 
restructuring related costs included million for employee severance and million for lease termination fees and the write off of disposed assets 
the restructuring charge was substantially utilized during operating costs as a percent of serviced contracts has declined from in to in  resulting in a decrease in operating costs of million on an annual run rate basis 
through the restructuring  wfs increased its contract production volume to billion compared with billion in prior to the restructuring  the company purchased contracts in offices  each serving either the prime or non prime market 
as part of the restructuring  the company closed poorly performing offices and combined its prime and non prime marketing into a single  unified marketing effort 
by combining the marketing of the two products under a single marketing force  wfs is able to more fully leverage its existing dealer relationships across the full spectrum of credit 
each of the offices underwrites contracts by employing separate credit analysts that specialize in either reviewing prime or non prime paper 
the underwriting process is further enhanced by credit policies and contract approval authorities controlled by the front end contract production system and through the use of the company s proprietary scorecard which was implemented in the fourth quarter of see business maintain solid asset quality consistent and expeditious underwriting 
as part of the restructuring  early delinquency collection efforts were centralized at two national servicing centers that employ automated queuing and dialing techniques to contact customers 
when these efforts are unsuccessful  the collection process is transferred to the rbcs where loan service counselors undertake more extensive collection efforts up to and including repossession 
the company plans to further improve its collection efforts by implementing a new collection system  including risk based collections  in during  the company also established a more effective management structure 
each rbc is managed by a rbc manager who directs and is responsible for the performance of the region 
four functional managers who oversee marketing  credit  collections and operations report directly to the rbc manager 
this organization is designed to provide overall coordination of the activities within the rbc with appropriate focus and specialization in each of these four critical business areas 
each of these critical functions also has a national director who provides expertise  training and policy development  management and enforcement 
this matrix structure has been effective in providing greater oversight  compliance and focus for each aspect of the organization and has helped standardize operating practices by identifying best practices and employing these practices throughout the organization 
income taxes wfs files federal and certain state tax returns as part of a consolidated group that includes the bank and westcorp  the holding company parent of the bank 
other state tax returns are filed by wfs as a separate entity 
tax liabilities from the consolidated returns are allocated in accordance with a tax sharing agreement based on the relative income or loss of each entity on a stand alone basis 
the effective tax rate for wfs was for  and see transactions with related parties tax sharing agreement 
financial condition contracts receivable and contracts held for sale wfs holds a portfolio of contracts on balance sheet for investment that totaled million at december  and million at december  contracts held for sale totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the balance in the held for sale portfolio is largely dependent upon the timing of the origination and securitization of contracts 
wfs completed securitization transactions of billion during  down from billion in as a result of the company s decision not to execute a securitization transaction in the third quarter  during a time when asset backed transactions were adversely affected by wider spreads thereby leaving a greater amount of automobile contracts on the balance sheet 
wfs securitized billion of contracts in february  and plans to continue to securitize contracts on a regular basis when favorable market conditions exist 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to wfs consolidated financial statements 
amounts due from trusts the excess cash flow generated by contracts sold to trusts is deposited into spread accounts by the trustee under the terms of the securitization transactions 
in addition  at the time a securitization transaction closes  wfs advances additional monies to wfal to initially fund these spread accounts 
wfs establishes a liability associated with its use of the spread account funds which is reduced as such funds reach predetermined funding levels 
wfs is released from obligation after the spread account reaches a predetermined funding level 
amounts due from trusts represents amounts due to wfs that are still under obligation to be held in the spread accounts 
the amounts due from trusts at december  was million compared with million at december  the increase is a result of the increase in total contracts securitized and outstanding

retained interest in securitized assets effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas requires that  following a transfer of financial assets  the transferor recognizes the assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  and derecognizes assets for which control has been surrendered and liabilities that have been extinguished 
for securitization transactions  sfas defines two separate financial assets retained at the time of securitization  a retained interest in securitized assets  which represents the excess spread created from securitization  and a servicing rights asset which represents the benefit derived from retaining the rights to service the contracts securitized 
previous accounting guidance did not separately distinguish these rights 
retained interests in securitized assets risa capitalized upon securitization of contracts represent the present value of the estimated future earnings to be received by wfs from the excess spread created in securitization transactions 
excess spread is calculated by taking the difference between the coupon rate of the contracts sold and the certificate rate paid to the investors less contractually specified servicing and guarantor fees 
prepayment and credit loss assumptions are utilized to project future excess spread and are based upon historical experience 
credit losses are estimated using a cumulative loss rate estimated by management to reduce the likelihood of asset impairment 
all assumptions used are evaluated each quarter and adjusted  if appropriate  to reflect actual performance of the contracts 
future earnings are discounted at a rate management believes to be representative of the market at the time of securitization 
the balance of the risa is amortized against actual excess spread income earned on a monthly basis over the expected repayment life of the underlying contracts 
risa s are classified in a manner similar to available for sale securities and as such are marked to market each quarter 
market value changes are calculated by discounting the excess spread using a current market discount rate 
any changes in the market value of the risa is reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated statement of income loss and comprehensive income loss and shareholders equity on the consolidated statements of financial condition as an unrealized gain or loss  net of applicable taxes 
two methods have arisen in practice to determine the fair value of future retained interest earnings  the cash in method and the cash out method 
the securities and exchange commission sec has set forth specific guidance that the cash out method is the only appropriate method to be used in determining the fair value of such assets as defined by the financial accounting standards board statement no 
the cash out method discounts future retained interest earnings from the period in which the transferor expects to receive the cash  thereby taking into consideration the period of time that the cash is received from obligors but restricted from distribution to the transferor 
wfs has historically and will continue to use the cash out method in measuring such assets 
wfs retains the rights to service all contracts it securitizes 
consumer servicing rights assets csra represent the present value of the estimated future earnings to be received from servicing securitized contracts 
these earnings are calculated by estimating future servicing revenues  including contractually specified servicing fees  late charges  other ancillary income  and float benefit and netting them against the actual cost to service contracts 
wfs has not capitalized any servicing rights as of december  the following table presents the activity of the risa for the year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance    additions    amortization    change in unrealized gain on securities available for sale  ending balance    at the time of a securitization  the company utilizes prepayment speed  net credit loss and discount rate assumptions to initially compute the value of the risa 
these assumptions may change periodically based on actual performance or other factors 
during  the company utilized prepayment rates of abs in computing risa 
cumulative net credit loss assumptions utilized for securitizations ranged from to 
the company used a discount rate of basis points over the two year treasury rate at the time of securitization in discounting future earnings 
the following table presents the estimated future undiscounted retained interest earnings to be received from securitizations 
estimated future undiscounted risa earnings are calculated by taking the difference between the coupon rate of the contracts sold and the certificate rate paid to the investors  less the contractually specified servicing fee and guarantor fees  after giving effect to estimated prepayments and assuming no losses 
to arrive at the risa  this amount is reduced by the off balance sheet allowance established for potential future losses and by discounting to present value 
december  dollars in thousands estimated net undiscounted cash flows   off balance sheet allowance for losses   discount to present value   retained interest in securitized assets   outstanding balance of contracts sold through securitizations   off balance sheet allowance for losses as a percent of contracts sold through securitizations the decline in the off balance sheet allowance is due to lower potential future losses as a result of a higher percentage of prime contracts securitized 
wfs believes that the off balance sheet allowance for losses is currently adequate to absorb potential losses in the sold portfolio

servicing contracts includes payment processing  customer service  managing delinquent contracts  repossessing and selling autos  securing defaulted contracts and recovering deficiency balances 
at december   delinquencies for the serviced portfolio was based on the dollar amount of contracts outstanding compared to and at december  and delinquency is calculated based on the contractual due date 
net chargeoffs on average contracts outstanding during the period totaled at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
wfs believes the increase in delinquency and loss experience is due to the shift in product mix from prime to non prime contracts in and  the disruption in collection efforts during the current year restructurings  and higher than expected bankruptcies 
see business maintain solid asset quality 
the following tables reflect the delinquency  repossession and loss experience that wfs has achieved as a result of its collection efforts 
it is the company s policy to charge off all contracts once they become days past due  including those that are not in compliance with a court ordered bankruptcy plan and whether or not the automobile has been repossessed or sold by that date 
wfs continues to accrue interest on a contract until it is charged off 
at the time a contract is charged off  all accrued but unpaid interest which has been previously included as income is reversed 
no assurance can be given that the future performance of the contracts purchased by the company will be similar to the delinquency  repossession and loss rates disclosed in the following tables

delinquency and loss experience was impacted by the disruption in collection efforts during the current year restructurings  see improve operating efficiencies  the shift to a greater ratio of non prime paper during and  and higher levels of bankruptcies 
capital resources and liquidity wfs requires substantial capital resources to support its business 
the primary cash requirements related to operating activities include i amounts needed to purchase contracts  ii dealer participation  iii securitization costs including spread account advances  and iv interest advances to trusts 
wfs also uses significant amounts of cash for operating 
sources of cash available to wfs include contract securitizations  borrowings under the line of credit and notes payable and collections of principal and interest from contracts 
these sources provide the liquidity needed to fund the purchase of contracts 
although wfs does not have publicly rated debt  its parent  the bank  receives long term deposit and subordinated debt ratings 
in november  moody s downgraded the long term deposit to ba from ba  issuer to b from ba and subordinated debt to b from b ratings of the bank 
this downgrade could result in higher future financing costs for wfs 
principal uses of cash purchase of contracts the most significant cash flow requirement is for the purchase of contracts 
wfs primarily uses the line of credit with the bank  to fund its purchase of contracts from dealers and consumers  which are held for sale until securitized 
wfs purchased billion of contracts during compared to billion in and billion in dealer participation consistent with industry practice  wfs pays an up front dealer participation to the originating dealer for each contract purchased 
participation paid by the company to dealers during was million compared to million in and million in contract securitizations at the time a securitization transaction closes  the company is required to advance monies to initially fund spread accounts 
the company funds these spread accounts by foregoing receipt of excess cash flow until these accounts exceed predetermined levels 
the amounts due from trusts represent funds due to the company which have not yet been disbursed from the spread accounts 
the amounts due from trusts at december   including initial advances not yet returned  was million compared to million at december  see transactions with related parties reinvestment contract 
advances due to servicer as the servicer of contracts sold in securitizations and in accordance with servicing agreements  wfs periodically makes advances to the securitization trusts to provide for temporary delays in the receipt of required payments from obligors 
wfs receives reimbursement of these advances through payments from the obligor on the contracts or from the trustee at the time a contract liquidates 
principal sources of cash contract securitizations the primary source of funds for wfs is the securitization of contracts 
wfs has regularly securitized contracts through underwritten public sales of securities since although the underlying interest costs associated with securitizations fluctuate  they are primarily market driven and not necessarily related to the operations of wfs 
wfs expects to continue to utilize securitization transactions as part of its liquidity strategy when the appropriate market conditions exist 
other sources wfs also obtains cash under the senior note  promissory note  line of credit  wfs reinvestment contract and short term investment from its parent  the bank 
see business transactions with related parties these financing sources  provided through our parent company  are expected to provide adequate funding of the company s operations  and while no assurances can be given  the company believes that its sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet its long and short term cash requirements 
asset liability management asset liability management is the process of measuring and controlling interest rate risk through matching the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities 
the contracts originated and held by wfs are all fixed rate and accordingly wfs has exposure to changes in interest rates 
wfs prepayment experience on contracts has not been historically sensitive to changes in interest rates and wfs therefore believes it is not exposed to significant prepayment risk relative to changes in interest rates 
as a result of this approach to interest rate management  combined with the company s hedging strategies  wfs does not anticipate that changes in interest rates will materially affect the company s results of operations or liquidity  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
the company s hedging strategy includes the use of two year treasury securities forward agreements 
generally  these agreements are entered into by the company in amounts which correspond to the principal amount of the securitization transactions 
the market value of these forward agreements is designed to respond inversely to the market value changes of the underlying contracts 
because of this inverse relationship  wfs can effectively lock in its gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
gains and losses relative to these agreements are deferred and recognized in full at the time of securitization as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts 
wfs enters into these forward agreements either with the bank or highly rated counterparties and further reduces its risk by avoiding any material concentration with a single counterparty 
credit exposure is limited to those agreements with a positive fair value and only to the extent of that fair value 
wfs hedges substantially all of its contracts pending securitization 
see note financial instrument agreements to wfs consolidated financial statements 
management monitors the company s hedging activities to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by senior management of wfs based upon the monitoring activities of the company 
wfs hedges substantially all of its contracts pending securitization either through outside parties or affiliated entities 
year during  the company began a formal risk evaluation of potential year issues 
the year issues arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail and create erroneous results 
the outcome of the risk evaluation was the formation of a year committee that consists of officers and employees of the company 
in addition  there is a committee that consists of directors that provide oversight and direction to the year committee 
the purpose of the year committee is to assess all risks  analyze current systems  coordinate upgrades and replacements  and report current and projected status of all known year compliance issues 
as a subsidiary of a federally chartered savings bank  wfs is subject to supervision and regulation by the office of thrift supervision ots 
as such  wfs and the bank s compliance to year issues are subject to the examination of the ots 
the company has initiated a five phase program to address the issues related to the year and the impact on the company s information and non information technology systems 
in addition  as part of the program  the company is in contact with its principal vendors to assess whether their year issues  if any  will affect the company 
the company  in phase one  identified year issues and created a plan 
in phase two  the company took inventory of the systems and programs affected by the year issues 
currently  the company is in the third  fourth and fifth phases of its year plan 
in these phases  the company ensures that the systems have been fixed and tested 
it is expected that the third and fourth phases be completed by march the final phase implements the tested year compliant systems 
for some applications  this phase has begun 
the company expects to have all applications implemented by june  the company s replacement or remedied costs for year compliance issues is estimated at approximately million  which the company will expense as incurred 
this estimated cost consists primarily of software upgrades that include new features which are combined with year corrections 
the company s inception to date year cost is approximately million 
due to the uncertainty and the lack of current disclosure by the electrical utility industry regarding the progress toward becoming year compliant  the company estimates that the worst case year issue scenario would be a possible discontinuance of electrical power 
in the event of an electrical power failure  the company has the capability to run its information systems at the corporate location on diesel powered generators 
there is no guarantee  however  that all issues will be foreseen and corrected  or that no material disruption of our business will occur 
effect of inflation and changing prices unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of wfs are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant effect on wfs performance than the general level of inflation

current accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement is effective with the year end financial statements  however  a total for comprehensive income is required in the financial statements of interim periods beginning with the first quarter of reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods provided for comparative purposes is required 
this statement establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements 
it requires that a company classify items of other comprehensive income  as defined by accounting standards  by their nature eg  unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale and retained interests in securitized assets in a financial statement with the same prominence as other financial statements  but does not require a specific format for that statement 
the accumulated balance of comprehensive income is to be displayed separately from retained earnings and additional paid in capital in the equity section of the consolidated statements of financial condition 
in june the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
this statement provides guidance for the way public enterprises report information about derivatives and hedging in annual financial statements and in interim financial reports 
the derivatives and hedging disclosure is required for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement will require wfs to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must by adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
wfs is in the process of evaluating the effect sfas will have  if any  on the earnings and financial position of the company 
forward looking statements included in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this annual report on form k are several forward looking statements

these forward looking statement are subject to many risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ significantly from historical results or from those anticipated by us 
the most significant risks and uncertainties we face are the level of charge offs  as an increase in the level of charge offs will decrease our earnings  our ability to originate new contracts in a sufficient amount to reach our needs  as a decrease in the amount of contracts we originate will decrease our earnings  a decrease in the difference between the average interest rate we receive on the contracts we originate and the rate of interest we must pay to fund our cost of originating those contracts  as a decrease will reduce our earnings  the continued availability of sources of funding for our operations  as a reduction in the availability of funding will reduce our ability to originate contracts  maintaining the level of operating costs  as an increase in those costs will reduce our net earnings  and the year issues  as a disruption of our collection efforts as a result of year problems or an increase in our costs to correct year issues will reduce earnings 
there are other risks and uncertainties we face  including the effect of changes in general economic conditions and the effect of new laws  regulations and court decisions

the company s asset liability committee is responsible for the management of interest rate risk 
this committee closely monitors interest rate risk and recommends policy for managing this risk 
the primary measurement tool for evaluating this risk is the use of interest rate shock analysis 
it should be noted that shock analysis is objective but not entirely realistic in that it assumes an instantaneous and isolated set of events 
contracts originated and held by wfs are all fixed rate and accordingly have exposure to changes in interest rates 
wfs prepayment experience on contracts has not been historically sensitive to changes in interest rates and wfs  therefore  believes it is not expected to be exposed to significant prepayment risk relative to changes in interest rates 
the company s hedging strategy includes the use of two year treasury securities forward agreements 
generally  these agreements are entered into by the company in amounts which correspond to the principal amount of the securitization transactions 
the market value of these forward agreements is designed to respond inversely to the market value changes of the underlying contracts 
because of this inverse relationship  wfs can effectively lock in its gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
gains and losses relative to these agreements are deferred and recognized in full at the time of securitization as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts 
wfs enters into these forward agreements either with the bank or highly rated counterparties and further reduces its risk by avoiding any material concentration with a single counterparty 
management monitors the company s hedging activities to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by senior management of wfs based upon the monitoring activities of the company 
as a result of this approach to interest rate management  combined with the company s hedging strategies  wfs does not anticipate that changes in interest rate will materially affect the company s results of operations or liquidity  although no assurance can be given in this regard
