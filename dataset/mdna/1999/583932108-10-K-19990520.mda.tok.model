item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in the physician management services operations  revenue is generated when the contracted physician performs a medical service that in turn is billed by the company to the ministry of health 
the fee for services billed to the ministry of health are based on rates set by the ministry of health and vary depending on the type of medical service performed 
the ministry of health pays the company on a monthly basis for these services billed and the company in turn pays the physician according to the contract between the physician and the company 
in addition  the company owns and manages its clinic and provides staffing  administration  management and financial support 
therefore  the company receives a monthly management fee from each clinic and is entitled to distributions made from the clinic 
in may of  management entered into a strategic partnership with clinicare of calgary  an automated medical records practice management system 
the clinicare system  when utilized to integrate the company s medical clinics  enables management to develop incremental medical records based complementary business opportunities 
as the dominant player in the canadian physician management services industry  management believes there is significant incremental revenue and profitability that will be derived from the effective management of the underlying medical records supporting the company s annual patient visits 
the company is launching an internet based healthcare network  called healthyconnect 
com  that will allow participants to access and exchange healthcare related information  purchase healthcare products and services  and communicate more cost effectively with one another 
healthyconnect 
com  combined with the clinicare strategic partnership  provides a platform by which the company can benefit from business opportunities that are complementary to its other two divisions 
these opportunities include provision of clinical trial services  the marketing of patient focussed medical information  and the ability of third party service providers to efficiently conduct their operations through an electronically integrated business partnership 
this integrated and rapidly growing canadian physician management services structure will be well positioned to provide physicians with the beneficial aspects of managed care  including dealing with the business complexities of cross relationships with service providers  and day to day operating efficiencies required to maximize earnings from their practice of medicine 
during  the company completed two acquisitions 
in june of  the company completed the acquisition all of the outstanding shares of jc medical management inc  a multi physician primary care clinic located in toronto  canada that provides healthcare to the surrounding community 
in september of  the company acquired of the outstanding shares of doctors on call ltd  an on call service that provides patients with hour access to medical services in london  canada 
in january of  the company acquired a interest in an urgent care centre  medical urgent care inc the company developed and opened its first urgent care centre in september the urgent care centre concept consists of a group of emergency trained physicians  a medical laboratory  a diagnostic radiology service  and a pharmacy  each of which must be present for the others to co exist  and each of which is provided by a separately owned company 
the company manages the clinic component of the urgent care centre and provides the support staff for this component 
ownership of medical urgent care inc is shared with the group of emergency trained physicians that provides the medical service in the clinic component 
in february   the company became party to a lease for the clinic located within york university in toronto  canada 
the company has entered into a management services agreement to manage to clinic for a monthly fee based on revenues generated by the clinic 
the company will have a interest in the company that owns the clinic 
in march of  the company purchased of the outstanding capital of caremedics elmvale inc  a multi physician primary healthcare clinic located in ottawa  canada 
the company entered into a management services agreement to manage the clinic for a monthly fee based on revenues generated by the clinic 
complementary to the development of the physician management services organization pmso and internet business  the company continues to promote its medical manpower staffing services throughout canada 
demand for emergency care has grown significantly over the past ten years  notwithstanding the small proportion of physicians focusing on emergency medicine 
moreover  recruitment of experienced emergency medicine practitioners by hospitals in other countries is intense and such demand is expected to continue for some time 
given the uncertainties associated with patient volumes in several ontario hospital emergency departments  the pool of available physicians willing to practice emergency medicine has been declining 
the company s ability to provide solutions and source physicians and highly skilled nurses will be enhanced by its success in developing its dominant status in the pmso sector 
in canada  in excess of seventy percent of physician staffing in hospital based emergency departments is provided by family physicians 
the company s business strategy is to integrate and through its physicians program offer the family physician a comprehensive practice opportunity 
management believes that the creation of a dominant mso status in canada will significantly contribute to the company s efforts in growing its emergency services recruitment division 
it is management s intention to market its mso services to the canadian physician community  which totals approximately  members strong and collects annual billings of approximately billion 
fees charged by the company for emergency department staffing services are comprised of two elements i hospital services  and ii physician services 
under each hospital contract  the company has the responsibility for the billing and collection of physician fees 
the company charges each hospital a fee for its recruiting and staffing services on a fixed fee basis 
the company s hospital contracts are designed to transfer to the hospital certain financial risks arising from changes in patient volume 
because the majority of such contracts are reimbursed from government healthcare insurance plans  the company s bad debt experience in collection of physician fees has been less than of allowable billings  primarily due to administrative errors 
fee for service contractual arrangements involve a credit risk related to services provided to uninsured individuals 
the company s working capital needs are generally a function of the acquisition of new hospital contracts or the conversion of fixed fee contracts to fee for service contracts 
as discussed below in results of operations  the company has sometimes experienced a reduction in the number of its hospital contracts  making the acquisition of new contracts particularly important 
the company s physician contracts are entered into between the company and individual physicians and are either part time or full time 
in general  each contracted physician will be placed in a functioning facility by the company and the company will collect all fees due to the physician for rendering medical services 
the company then pays the physician for the medical services provided based on the terms of the contract between the company and the physician
