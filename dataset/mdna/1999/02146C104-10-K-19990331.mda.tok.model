this increase was primarily due to the investment of proceeds received from the debentures issued in may minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest in losses of consolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december  was million  representing an increase of million from  for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of residences owned by the company within consolidated  majority owned joint venture arrangements 
during  the company had an average of residences held in consolidated joint venture arrangements compared to one residence held in a consolidated joint venture arrangements during net loss 
as a result of the foregoing  the net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to a net loss of million for the comparable period in liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december   and  the company experienced cash flow deficits from operations of million   and million  respectively 
these cash flow deficits were primarily a result of the company s significant development of new residences  which typically incur cash flow deficits during the lease up period 
a significant number of these new residences were owned in consolidated joint venture arrangements 
consistent with the terms of these agreements  operating deficits included in cash flow from operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  were funded with capital contributions from the minority partners 
in and  the cash flow deficit was also caused by restructuring and transaction costs of approximately million and million respectively  incurred in connection with the sterling merger and general administrative expense necessary to support the company s continued growth 
during the year ended december   the company executed approximately million of new financing 
financing was provided through the sale of debentures pursuant to the exercise of an overallotment option and the issuance of common stock in january which provided net proceeds of million and million  respectively  million of sale leaseback financing  million of secured mortgage financing  million of unsecured short term financing  million of minority partner contributions and cash from operations 
in addition  the company assumed existing debt of million related to acquisitions completed in this financing along with approximately million in available cash and investments was used to fund million in construction and development activity  million in acquisition activity  million in joint venture buy outs  and operating cash flow deficits 
in december  the company had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at december  the decrease was due to the utilization of million in cash and investments to fund additional construction and development activities during the company s earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges by million and million for the years ended december  and to achieve its growth objectives  the company will need to obtain sufficient financing to fund its development  construction and acquisition activities 
the company has plans to develop approximately million of residences for the month period ending december  historically  the company has financed its development program and acquisitions through a combination of various forms of real estate financing mortgage and sale leaseback financing  capital contributions from joint venture partners and the sale of its securities 
the company currently has executed non binding letters of intent with various healthcare reits and commitments from conventional lenders for financing 
as of december   the company had million and million of remaining financing commitments from these healthcare reits and conventional lenders  respectively 
in addition  the company will require approximately million to acquire the properties it has agreed to purchase from hcr manor care 
the company expects to finance this transaction through a separate credit facility 
in addition to financing construction and development costs  the company will require capital resources to meet its operating and working capital needs incurred primarily in connection with the start up and lease up phases of new residences 
the company believes that its cash on hand  financing under these commitments  other financing that the company expects to be able to access and equity contributions from its joint venture development partners will be sufficient to fund its growth strategy for the next months 
a lack of funds may require the company to delay or eliminate all or some of its development projects and acquisition plans 
in addition  the company may require additional financing to enable it to acquire additional residences  to respond to changing economic conditions  to expand the company s development program or to account for changes in assumptions related to its development program 
there can be no assurance that any newly constructed residences will achieve a stabilized occupancy level and attain a resident mix that meet the company s expectations or generate sufficient positive cash flow to cover operating and financing costs associated with such residences 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in securing additional financing or that adequate funding will be available and  if available  will be on terms that are acceptable to the company 
the company is obligated under its joint venture arrangements to purchase the equity interests of its joint venture partners at fair market value upon the election of such partners 
within the next twelve months  the company will become subject to such contingent purchase obligations with respect to equity interests held by joint venture partners  exercisable at their election  related to certain of the company s residences 
at such times  or earlier  as such contingent purchase obligations are exercisable  the company may also elect to exercise its rights to purchase such interests 
based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions as to the number of residences to be developed with joint venture partners  the timing of such development  the time at which such options may be exercised and the fair market value of such residences at the date such options are exercised  the company estimates that it may require approximately million to million to satisfy these purchase obligations during the month period ended december  impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 
inflation could  however  affect the company s results of operations due to the company s dependence on its senior resident population who rely on liquid assets and relatively fixed incomes to pay for the company s services 
as a result  the company may not be able to increase residence service fees to account fully for increased operating expenses 
in structuring its fees  the company attempts to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to anticipate fully or otherwise respond to any future inflationary pressures 
in addition  given the significant amount of construction and development activity which the company anticipates  inflationary pressures could affect the company s cost of new product deployment and financing 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
year issue as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  any of the company s computer systems that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the so called year issue 
this could result in certain system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions to the operations or business activities of the company 
the company began evaluating its compliance with year issues in an assessment of existing systems indicated that all of its principal systems  such as general ledger  accounts payable  billing  property management  and all desktop applications such as word processing  e mail and spreadsheet applications were compliant 
to address the significant growth of the company  a new corporate telecommunications system was installed in and the company implemented a new human resources and payroll system on january  while preliminary indications suggest that there are no systems in the residences that will be affected call systems  elevators  phones  etc  the company will be completing its evaluation of compliance of these systems during the second quarter of while the company does not believe that it has any significant exposure from lack of compliance by third party vendors  it will also be completing its evaluation of those vendor systems by the second quarter of  thus allowing for the remainder of to develop any contingency plans that might be required 
because the company s hardware and software has been determined to be year compliant  and third party vendor arrangements are not anticipated to have a significant effect on operations  the company does not expect that issues associated with year compliance will have any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that the computer systems of other businesses on which the company s operations rely  such as utilities  transportation  communications  banking and government  will be timely modified  or that a failure to modify such systems by such businesses  or modifications that are incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
because the remaining focus around year compliance issues relates primarily to identifying third party problems or issues and contingency plans  if necessary  the company believes that the associated costs related to year compliance will be immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis which presents the hypothetical change in fair value of those financial instruments held by the company at december  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from an immediate hypothetical one percentage point parallel shift in the yield curve 
the fair value of the debt included in the analysis is million 
although not expected  a one percentage point change in the interest rates would have caused the company s annual interest expense to change by approximately million 
accordingly  a significant increase in libor could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
although a majority of the debt and lease payment obligations of the company as of  or during the twelve months ended  december  are not subject to floating interest rates  indebtedness that the company may incur in the future may bear interest at a floating rate 
debt and annual operating lease payment obligations will continue to increase significantly as the company pursues its growth strategy 
the company does not presently use financial derivative instruments to manage its interest costs 
the company does not use foreign currency exchange rate forward contracts or commodity contracts and does not have foreign currency exposure as of december
