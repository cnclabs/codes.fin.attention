item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
years ended december   and usdata corporation the company is a global supplier of real time manufacturing application development software that enables information integration  decision support and supervisory control throughout the manufacturing enterprise 
the company s component based products help automate manufacturing and process control applications  allowing customers to reduce operating costs  shorten cycle times  and improve product quality 
the company provides this knowledge through software products and services and delivers it through a community of business partners 
the company brings nearly a quarter century of expertise in manufacturing performance improvement to its partners and end users 
net sales have been generated primarily from licenses of the factorylink r family of products and secondarily from technical support and service agreements  training classes  and product related integration services 
the support and services agreements are generally one year  renewable contracts entitling a customer to certain software upgrades and technical support 
support and service revenue represented approximately   and of net sales during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the company released factorylink r and  real time information windows nt and windows platforms supporting powerful client access environments and technologies and providing year readiness 
in addition  the company released during  year ready versions for all other major platforms historically marketed by the company 
in early the company also began shipping factorylink r webclient  which provides the ability to view and control any factorylink r server running microsoft windows nt using a simple web browser 
in mid  the company introduced its newest software product  xfactory tm  a manufacturing execution software mes product which incorporates microsoft s newest technologies and is built on microsoft s distributed internet applications dna architecture 
xfactory tm enables manufacturing plants to more easily and quickly automate their production processes and is the first visual object modeling mes 
the xfactory tm software product enables customers to develop versatile and flexible mes applications for production management  product tracking  product scheduling  and genealogy tracking for manufacturing and production processes 
during  the company successfully completed its transition to an indirect sales model and now focuses its sales efforts through selected distributors and vars value added resellers capable of providing the level of support and expertise required in the real time manufacturing and process control application market 
the company had previously employed multiple channels of distribution which combined the company s direct sales and support resources with qualified third party remarketers 
this change was an important part of the company s new strategic plan developed in the latter part of the company currently has seven channel support locations in the united states and six internationally to support its sales efforts through its network of distributors and vars 
export sales are a significant element of the company s activities and  in the years ended december   and  represented  and  respectively  of total net sales 
effective july   the company sold its auto id hardware integration and servicing business systems operations 
in conjunction therewith  during the first quarter of  the company reported a loss of  related to the disposal thereof and  related to operations through the date of disposal 
risks and uncertainties except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this form k  including the managements s discussion and analysis  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
potential risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following rapid technological change the market for computer software in general is characterized by rapid changes in computer hardware and software technology and is highly competitive 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  respond to evolving end user requirements and achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products or product enhancements on a timely basis or in a manner that satisfies customers needs or achieves market acceptance 
dependence on principal product families the company currently derives substantially all its net sales from licenses of the company s factorylink r family of products and related support services 
while the company has introduced xfactory tm and plans on additionally broadening its product families  it expects that factorylink r products will continue to account for a substantial portion of its net sales 
intense competition some of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors have been or could be acquired by larger  stronger companies  thus increasing their competitive resources 
there can be no assurance that such competitors will not be better positioned to adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources than the company to the promotion and sales of products 
the company s competitors may also increase their efforts to gain and retain market share through competitive pricing 
timing of sales the company has historically operated with little backlog because software products are shipped as orders are received 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecast 
if net sales do not meet the company s expectations in any given quarter  operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition  the loss of a significant customer  the addition of a large customer  or changes in seasonal patterns of capital spending by customers of the company would affect the company s financial results 
dependence on key personnel the company believes its future success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of its senior management  highly skilled employees  contractors and other senior personnel 
in particular  the marketplace for skilled  technical employees and contractors in the company s business is extremely competitive 
although the company expects to be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees and contractors for the foreseeable future  the can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so

the net result of this product mix shift was reflected in lower overall average selling prices asps for the company s products which partially offset the positive impact of increased unit shipments 
however  during the latter part of the company s asps began to stabilize as over of all unit shipments were for windows nt and windows platforms in compared to in revenues from product related consulting declined substantially from reflecting the company s decision to refer nearly all such activity to its channel distribution partners 
north american sales decreased by while european sales increased in compared to north american sales and international sales were and of total sales  respectively

no assurance can be given  however  that such credit facility or debt or equity financing will be available to the company on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  if at all 
impact of year issue the company is currently addressing the year yk issue  which results from the fact that many computer programs were previously written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
programs written in this way may recognize a date ending in as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
during the company completed its conversion to a new integrated business software solution  which provides order processing  sales administration  accounts receivable  accounts payable and general ledger systems 
however  the new software is not currently yk ready  therefore  during the first half of  the company plans on upgrading to the most recent version of this software  which is yk ready 
thereafter  the company is planning on conducting transaction based testing to confirm the system s ability to handle transactions related to the yk 
the company has not estimated the cost of completing this upgrade  but currently believes it will not be material 
the company has recently upgraded to a new internal network server  both hardware and software  which are both yk ready 
outside of its integrated business software applications  the company has very few systems that are interfaced together and therefore believes that its exposure is relatively low that a yk problem with any one system or application can adversely impact the entire it environment 
for primarily operational purposes  the company has been upgrading pcs and individual applications running thereon throughout and the upgraded pcs and application software are yk ready and the company believes it has minimal exposure to any business interruption from out of date pc s  network equipment or related software 
in addition  the company has a backup process in place under which data from individual pcs are backed up to an it controlled server 
therefore  if any one application does not function due to yk issues  the data can easily be moved to another desktop station that is yk ready 
additionally  during the company conducted an inventory of pc s  software and network equipment to determine which of those might need to be replaced or upgraded because of yk related issues 
the company s primary products are manufacturing related software 
the company has established a process for testing and certifying these software products for yk readiness 
during  the company released a yk ready version of factorylink r for all major platforms supported by the company 
the company has used and plans on continuing to use its own internal development and support resources to test and remediate its product software for yk readiness 
all new products of the company introduced in are yk ready 
the company has also established a special section on its world wide web site devoted to yk readiness 
the site clearly indicates what the company means when it states a product is yk ready  which specific products are yk ready and what the upgrade path is  if required  to bring older versions of its products up to yk readiness 
customers who are covered under the company s service and support agreements are eligible to receive yk versions of the company s products at no additional cost 
the company has instituted specific marketing and pricing programs to identify and assist customers who are not covered under the company s service and support agreements in upgrading to yk ready versions of its software products 
additionally  the company has added specific language to its standard product warranty addressing yk 
the company has not obtained  nor does it anticipate obtaining  any insurance coverage for yk problems 
to date  the company has not incurred any material expense directly related to yk readiness for its internal it and non it computer systems 
activities and expenses associated with conversion to new or upgraded systems have been driven primarily by operational considerations 
the company plans to use its internal resources to address any yk readiness issues which are currently planned or may yet arise 
the company has not separately tracked these types of expense  but does not currently believe they have been or will be material 
the company has incurred costs in terms of time spent on research  modification  testing and remediation for its manufacturing related software products but has not determined the magnitude of such costs to date 
additional internal resources will be utilized during  however  the company does not currently expect such expenses to be material to its financial position or results of operations 
the company does not currently believe it is dependent on any significant suppliers for which there may be yk readiness issues 
services such as banking and insurance are conducted with companies that either are or will be yk ready
