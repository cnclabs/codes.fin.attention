impact of year the company has completed an assessment of the hardware and software in its internal information systems and has substantially completed the necessary modifications 
the company is currently testing its critical systems to verify proper date handling functionality with respect to year and thereafter 
the company is working with its significant suppliers and business partners to ensure that those parties have appropriate year readiness plans  and will be able to continue to provide products and services to the company 
the company is assessing the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should those organizations fail to properly remediate either their computer systems or their product offerings 
the company s comprehensive year initiative is being managed by a team of internal staff who expect to complete the year initiative in the fall of the company believes it is adequately addressing the year issues 
it does not believe that the year matters discussed above will have a material impact on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies will not fail  and that such failures would not have an adverse effect on the company 
in order to mitigate the risk of supplier and business partner non compliance  the year initiative also includes the creation of contingency plans  both from technical and business process perspectives 
based on the company s assessments to date  the costs of the year initiative are estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million has been incurred to date 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete its year initiative are forward looking statements and are based on management s best estimates  according to information available through the company s assessments to date 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the retention of these professionals  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
at present the company has not experienced any significant problems in these areas

these risks primarily relate to the sale of products to foreign customers and changes in interest rates on the company s long term debt obligations  discounted lease rentals  capital leases and other long term debt obligations
