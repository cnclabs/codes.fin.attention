other revenues include those derived from information based product and services  financial advisory services  and publication of newsletters  reference manuals  and data series for the energy and transportation industries services 
the company s client base includes both the public and private sector 
revenue from the private sector is typically characterized by higher gross margins than the public sector  yet generally requires a higher relative level of infrastructure support 
consequently  the company s operating performance is affected by its public sector private sector business mix 
through strategic acquisitions and internal growth  the company has increased its private sector client base  and will continue to pursue such opportunities in the future 
total revenues represent the total of all revenues related to contracts  including revenues associated with professional staff  subcontractors and independent consultants 
consulting revenues represent the amount of contract revenue associated with billings by the company s professional staff

the company derives substantially all of its revenues from fees for professional services 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis 
the majority of revenues are billed at standard daily rates  standard hourly rates  or cost plus fixed fees 
revenues from standard daily rate contracts are recognized at amounts represented by the agreed upon billing amounts and costs are recognized as incurred 
revenues from standard hourly rate engagements are recognized as hours are recorded and costs are recognized as they are incurred 
revenue from cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized as costs are incurred on the basis of direct costs plus allowable indirect costs and a pro rata portion of estimated fee 
the remainder of the revenues are billed on a fixed bid basis and by lump sum fee arrangements 
revenues from fixed bid type contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting with costs and estimated profits included in contract revenues based on the relationship that contract costs incurred bear to management s estimate of total contract costs

project personnel are typically full time professionals employed by the company  although the company often supplements its professional project staff through the use of subcontractors and independent consultants

year the year issue is the result of computer hardware and software being designed with the year field being set for two digits instead of four digits 
computer programs and systems with this problem will be unable to properly distinguish between the year and the year as a result  the programs could fail or yield incorrect results 
the company s business  as well of those of its principal suppliers and clients  is dependent on the ability of its software and hardware systems to properly function 
failure of one or more of these systems of the company or a material client or supplier could disrupt the company s operations and cause a material adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s year strategy the company has established the year readiness plan the plan to prepare for the year issue 
this plan is comprised of the following elements audit  remediation  and testing of internal systems 
obtaining assurance or information on the state of year readiness of our material clients and suppliers who exchange information electronically with us or upon whom our work product may depend 
developing contingency plans  when practical  to address potential year failures 
the company s goal is to complete implementation of the plan by september  detailed below are the status of progress and timetables for each of the phases of the plan 
assessment remediation testing implementation it domestic complete current current by rd quarter it international by nd quarter during nd quarter during nd quarter by rd quarter business operations complete complete complete complete embedded st quarter st rd quarter st rd quarter by rd quarter rd party nd quarter during nd quarter nd rd quarter by rd quarter year readiness report the company made several acquisitions in it undertook a comprehensive due diligence examination that identified general year readiness issues for itself and the companies it acquired 
the company recently formalized its efforts by establishing a year working committee the committee led by its chief information officer to oversee the integration of its year efforts and to implement the plan 
the committee includes the coo  cfo  general counsel  and other company executives and outside consultants as required 
the company has engaged a consultant to complete the assessment of its domestic offices and to assist in the assessment of its major international offices 
the company s front office systems used for the delivery of services to clients  both hardware and software  were replaced or significantly upgraded in and and were manufactured to be year ready with minor  vendor identified problems 
the company currently expects that the process of updating those systems that are not year ready will be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company does not employ any significant custom programming in its front office  work product  or back office systems 
the company s work product is generated almost exclusively with commercially available statistical  econometric  word processing  spreadsheet  database  or mathematical software for which the company has obtained year readiness assurances 
these software products have been audited and updated where appropriate 
the company will implement a firm wide software application to monitor year compliance of new work product and to provide a testing mechanism for the re use of models  spreadsheets  or databases 
this application is a commercially available year audit and remediation product specifically designed for microsoft windows compliant software applications 
a conversion was undertaken in to replace a significant and non compliant analytic system used to service client analysis needs  including hardware and software  with a compliant system 
the implementation is complete and the conversion of existing analytic applications will be complete by september  back office systems including financial accounting  project accounting  fixed asset management  human resources  payroll  and conflict management have been replaced  updated with vendor supplied year fixes  or converted to compliant versions of the software 
during the second quarter  the company plans to undertake a comprehensive test of its back office systems 
certain models of personal computers have been identified as non compliant and will be replaced in the number of year replacements will not exceed the normal annual personal computer turnover 
the company is contacting the vendors of its principal office systems in order to obtain proof of year readiness 
the company s material office systems include its telephone  communications and networking equipment  security and facilities systems  copiers  pagers  voicemail  and faxing systems 
because the company is highly decentralized with over domestic and international offices  it does not expect the audit and remediation of these office systems to be complete before september  some office systems in the company s international offices will not be corrected by december   but the company does not expect such systems to materially affect the company s ability to complete its engagements 
clients the company s clients include domestic and international companies  private law firms  the united states and state  local and foreign governments and governmental agencies and government owned enterprises 
the company has responded to year compliance surveys from over of its major clients and shared the readiness information disclosed here 
the company is planning to survey in the second quarter its top clients measured by revenue generated for the company in to determine their year readiness 
the company plans to survey other clients if circumstances warrant and to survey new clients upon new engagements 
material vendors the company performs analytic work on time sensitive matters 
certain vendors have been identified as critical to implementing the plan 
these vendors include payroll  credit  transportation  information resources  and certain maintenance providers of mission critical hardware and software 
if one or more of the company s principal vendors experiences significant business disruption as a result of the year issue  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
for example  if the company s principal suppliers of real time electricity data are not functioning properly  the company may be unable to perform analytic work for clients 
similarly  if hardware used to perform modeling cannot be supported because of a year issue at the vendor  the company s ability to meet client demands for time sensitive analysis might be jeopardized 
the committee will be contacting the company s principal vendors during the second quarter of based on the responses  the committee may need to develop contingency plans to replace those vendors whose ability to certify year readiness is in doubt 
the committee expects that the process of evaluating and working with outside vendors will continue into the third quarter of contingency planning the committee is developing a contingency plan in the event that any material system or vendor will not be year ready by december  this contingency plan is scheduled to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of  although it will be reviewed and refined thereafter as the committee continues to evaluate the company s systems and vendors 
costs the company will budget  in each of the next two fiscal years  and  to cover the costs of evaluating systems  acquiring year remediation software  additional testing of hardware and software  hiring an outside year consultant  and administrative costs associated with implementing the plan 
although the company believes this amount will be sufficient to meet the costs of the company s year readiness efforts  there can be no assurance that the costs to implement the plan will not significantly exceed the company s current estimates 
to date  expenditures for year readiness have been nominal and associated with the rapid implementation of already planned front office and back office systems upgrades 
risks at present  the company perceives that its greatest year risk is its dependence on an external network of information providers  vendors  and experts to complete its engagements 
even if the company can satisfy itself that the systems of its material suppliers and partners are year ready  those suppliers and partners in turn rely on a myriad of suppliers to operate their businesses 
year related failures far removed from the company could trigger a chain of events that could materially harm the company s business 
certain clients  despite their best efforts  may suffer the effects of year failures of others and thus delay  cancel  or substantially alter work in progress resulting in a negative effect on the operations of the company  including the failure to meet financial expectations or the loss of key personnel 
such a chain of events could also lead to litigation against the company 
there can be no assurance that year problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates can have a material effect on the company s operations 
interest rate risk the company is subject to risk from changes in interest rates 
the company utilizes us dollar denominated borrowings to fund its operational needs  and as of december   had total outstanding debt of approximately  a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates on the company s total outstanding debt as of december  would not have been material 
interest rates may move in the company s favor 
while the company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of this interest rate risk  there can be no assurance that losses will not result 
foreign currency exchange risk the company is subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for its subsidiaries which use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
such changes could result in cumulative translation gains or losses that are included in shareholders equity 
in the year ended december   approximately of the company s total revenues were derived from operations in foreign countries including argentina  armenia  australia  canada  france  ireland  indonesia  pakistan and new zealand 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies of these countries result in positive or negative fluctuations in the amounts relating to foreign operations reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
none of the components of the company s financial statements were materially affected by exchange rate fluctuations in the years ended december    or the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which some of the company s sales are denominated would have resulted in a decrease in earnings of approximately  the potential impact of the same hypothetical uniform change on the company s cash flows would have resulted in a decrease in cash flows of approximately  this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
foreign exchange rates may move in the company s favor 
the sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to fluctuations in exchange rates is periodically assessed by management by applying an appropriate range of potential rate fluctuations to the company s assets  liabilities  and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currency 
historically  the company has not used foreign currency options and forward contracts to hedge against the earnings effects of such fluctuations 
while the company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of this currency risk  there can be no assurance that losses will not result
