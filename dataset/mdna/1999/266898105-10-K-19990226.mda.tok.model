item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the financial information included herein should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements contained therein 
general the company is a development stage pharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the development of proprietary methods of photodynamic therapy pdt and photodetection pd utilizing levulan r 
the company has filed its first nda with the fda which is for treatment of multiple aks with levulan r pdt 
various other indications are at exploratory  phase i or phase ii stages 
see business company s products and technology  manufacturing 
since its inception  the company has primarily devoted its resources to funding research and development and as a result the company has experienced significant operating losses 
to strengthen its cash position and in order to support on going operations during the fda review process  the company completed a private placement of  shares of its common stock plus  shares issued to the placement agent as its commission  in january raising gross proceeds of  as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  the company s transition from a development stage company to a profitable operating company is dependent upon marketing approval by the fda and the ability of the company to develop a market for its products 
although the company believes its clinical trials support the aks products safety and efficacy  there can be no assurance that the products will be approved by the fda 
additionally  the company cannot be sure that a successful market will develop for its new technology  levulan r pdt for aks 
at this time the company is developing various plans for marketing its first product upon receipt of regulatory marketing approval 
the company is negotiating potential collaborative licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies with manufacturing and or sales and distribution capability to market its products 
the company is also developing plans to market the products through distribution or co promotion arrangements 
in november  the company signed a purchase and supply agreement with nbc covering the light source  the blu u tm  which is part of the company s nda  as well as other light sources which the parties may develop under their co development agreement 
while the company s working relationship with nbc is strong  the dependence on this unrelated third party as its sole source of supply for its first nda product represents a risk to the company 
any material failure by nbc to meet fda regulatory requirements or the company s supply needs could adversely effect the company s financial condition or results 
the company believes that the terms of the agreement will help to control these risks 
the company has agreed to order all of its supply of these light sources for certain territories from nbc and nbc has agreed to supply the company with the quantities it orders subject to the terms of the agreement 
if an opportunity arises  the parties have agreed to negotiate the terms under which nbc would supply light sources to the company for sale in countries other than the current territories 
nbc has granted a license to the company to manufacture the light sources in certain situations if nbc fails to meet the company s supply needs 
the company also has a worldwide license to import  use  sell or dispose of the light sources under nbc s technology within a specific field of use 
also  nbc has agreed that it will not supply certain light sources which may compete with the company s business 
the agreement has a ten year term  subject to earlier termination for breach or insolvency  or for convenience 
however  a termination for convenience requires twelve months prior written notice which may not be given prior to the third anniversary of the date of the agreement 
similarly  the company is dependent upon sole suppliers for bulk ala which the company formulates into levulan r  and for the manufacture of the kerastick tm brand applicators 
the company has recently been informed that the facility of our bulk ala supplier does not yet meet fda s good manufacturing practices gmp regulations 
the company is in regular communication with the supplier on these issues 
we believe that the supplier is actively working to resolve the deficiencies in order to be gmp compliant upon re inspection by the fda 
at this time the company is developing various plans for marketing its first product upon receipt of regulatory marketing approval 
the company is negotiating potential collaborative licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies with manufacturing and or sales and distribution capability to market its products 
the company is also developing plans to market the products through distribution or co promotion arrangements 
the company has identified other suppliers of bulk ala but the regulatory issues associated with qualifying a second source as a sole source  if necessary  would likely delay the company s fda approval and the marketing of levulan r pdt 
the company is considering when it may be desirable and or necessary and the extent of the financial costs to reduce risks associated with the third party manufacture of ala by establishing a back up supplier and of kerasticks tm by establishing its own limited production line 
as previously reported  the company and parteq agreed to revised terms in october and signed an amended license agreement on march  as partial consideration  parteq received options to purchase  shares of common stock of the company at an exercise price of per share which will vest over four years from the october grant date 
the company has agreed to pay royalties of and on of its or its affiliates net selling price of products in countries where patent rights do and do not exist  respectively 
the company also will pay and when patent rights do and do not exist  respectively  on the company s net selling price less cost of goods for products sold to sublicensees 
also  the company is obligated to pay of lump sum sublicense fees paid to the company  such as milestone payments for important regulatory hurdles excluding amounts designated by the sublicense for future research and development efforts  and of royalty payments the company receives on sales of products by sublicensees 
during  the company paid to parteq a minimum royalty of cdn  under certain conditions  additional minimum royalty payments will be made during the term  in amounts up to cdn  if the company enters a sublicense arrangement for both the united states and europe encompassing substantially all dermatological indications 
should no united states patent subsist  whether by virtue of expiry  invalidation or rejection  the agreement becomes perpetual and royalty free 
commencing with the first year of health regulatory approval in the united states  provision is made for minimum royalty payments to parteq 
the company has the right to terminate the license agreement  with or without cause  upon ninety days notice 
the agreement is effective through the expiration date of the latest united states patent made subject to the agreement 
parteq s basic japanese patent on the method of using ala which issued in  has recently become the subject of an opposition proceeding 
as a result  the japanese board of appeals issued a notice of reasons for cancellation 
the company intends to contest this action 
however  the company cannot at this time give any assurance of the likelihood of success of such a contest or any assurance that the company will decide to spend the funds required to complete the contest 
parteq and the company have also agreed to amend the ala assignment agreement with draxis dated october   so that the terms which assign the canadian rights from parteq to draxis will be consistent with the amended license agreement

to the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its development stage operations primarily from sales of securities in public and private offerings 
in january  the company issued  shares of its common stock in a private placement pursuant to regulation d of the securities act of at per share 
the company received net proceeds of  an additional  shares of common stock were issued as commission and non accountable expense allowance to the placement agent 
additional compensation was paid to the placement agent in  five year warrants each of which are exercisable into one share of common stock at per share 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company s total assets  consisting primarily of united states government securities available for sale  were  as compared to  as of december  the company s united states government securities available for sale have an aggregate cost of  and a current aggregate market value of  as of december   resulting in a net unrealized gain on securities available for sale of  provision for which has been recorded as part of shareholders equity and as an item of comprehensive income 
at december   the aggregate cost was  and had a market value of  resulting in an unrealized loss of  the market value of the company s government securities fluctuates  with changes in interest rates in the united states from the time these securities were acquired 
some losses could be realized  depending upon the timing of the company s need to convert government securities into cash to meet its working capital requirements 
the company s us government securities currently have yields ranging from to  and maturity dates ranging from january  to august  as of december  the company s us government securities had yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to august  the company has invested its funds in liquid investments  so that it will have ready access to its cash reserves as needed for the funding of its development plan on a short term and long term basis 
the net proceeds from the company s recent private placement have also been invested in short and medium term us government securities 
as of december   the company had current liabilities of  as compared to  as of december  since its inception  the company has had no long term debt  nor does it have any plans to enter into any such financial arrangements 
management is currently focusing its attention and its funds on commercialization of levulan r pdt for multiple aks and development of its bladder cancer detection indication 
full development and testing of all potential indications which are currently under development  and or the market launch of its products if the company determines to market the products on its own  would likely require additional funding 
the timing of the expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including progress of the company s research and development programs  the results of preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  competitive developments  payments under any collaborative arrangements  if any  entered into by the company and the availability of financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that such funds will be sufficient to enable the company to obtain regulatory marketing approval or to market any product for any indications currently under development 
therefore  there is no way to predict the timing or magnitude of the revenues from the marketing of the company s product or whether any such revenues will be realized 
while the net proceeds of the recent offering should enable the company to maintain its current research program as planned and prepare to commercialize levulan r pdt for aks through most of the year  in order to maintain continuing research and development programs beyond and to market its first product  it would be necessary to raise additional funds through future corporate alliances  financings  or other sources 
if sufficient funds are available  the company may also use its resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  technologies  or products that enhance or expand the company s business 
see business light devices and technology 
the company will be actively seeking relationships with pharmaceutical or other suitable organizations to market the company s products and technologies  or provide funding for research projects 
the company has fifteen full time employees 
the company has employment agreements with its three key executive officers 
the company has purchased key man life insurance  having a face value of cdn 
 on the life of the company s president  for which the company is the named beneficiary 
the company has also retained numerous independent consultants and the services of key researchers at leading university centers whose activities are coordinated by the company s employees 
see note g 
to the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company expects that it will hire or retain significantly more employees and consultants as commercialization of levulan r pdt approaches  particularly in the operations  financial and regulatory areas 
see business other relationships consultants 
the company has not made material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the near term 
if the company decides  in the future  to establish a limited production line for the manufacture of kerasticks tm  the company expects that it will be governed by environmental laws but it does not expect these laws to require material capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future  or any assurance that the operations  business or assets of the company will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
see business government regulation 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  the company has had no sales to date 
at the current time  the fda is reviewing the company s first nda for levulan r pdt to treat multiple actinic keratoses aks of the face and scalp 
the fda is required to formally respond to the company by july with comments concerning the approvability of the nda for marketing 
delays in this process such as requests for additional data or clinical trials  or failure of the company s supplier of ala to meet fda regulations within a reasonable period of time would delay potential fda marketing approval and would have a significant adverse impact on the financial strength of the company 
the time required to complete the government regulatory approval process ie  the length of time required by the company to complete the nda prior to filing  together with the fda review process and any additional development activities that may be required will have a direct effect on whether the company will maintain its current funding levels for all of the levulan r pdt pd indications which it is currently supporting 
in order to maintain the research and development program as now planned beyond  the company may need to raise additional funds 
it may enter into joint development or licensing arrangements  both domestically and internationally  with pharmaceutical companies  in which it will seek to have an alliance partner make up front and or milestone payments  and assume certain of the costs of clinical testing and of obtaining regulatory marketing approval for the products licensed 
however  there is no assurance at this time that a transaction will be consummated 
to the extent that the company is unable to enter into such arrangements  it will require separate funding to complete the regulatory approval process for bladder cancer detection and will likely need additional funds to market its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient funds to obtain approval of any product  that any product will be successfully developed  proven to be safe and effective in necessary pivotal clinical trials  or receive applicable regulatory marketing approvals 
therefore  there is no way to predict the timing or magnitude of the revenues from the marketing of the company s product or whether any such revenues will be realized or whether additional funds will be available on reasonable terms 
interest income  earned primarily on united states government securities  decreased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   as the company continued to expend funds for ongoing research and development 
interest income  the only significant source of income at the current time  is expected to increase temporarily due to the receipt of significant proceeds from the recently completed private placement 
however  unless the company s nda is approved and a market develops  interest income would decline as funds are expended for research and development programs 
interest income for the cumulative period from february  date of incorporation to december  was research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in costs reflected the completion of the multi center phase iii trials for aks and completion of the filing of the aks nda in july the company s research efforts for the remainder of were directed to the bladder cancer pd trials  as funding for secondary indications was decreased pending the company s consummation of a strategic alliance or financing 
the company expects that research and development costs could increase above expenditures depending upon whether a marketing alliance is consummated 
total research and development costs for the cumulative period from february  date of incorporation to december  were  costs and development fees associated with agreements for research projects and clinical studies commit the company to make payments during of  see note i 
to the company s notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see also business other contractual relationships 
operating expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  operating costs are expected to increase in the future as the company continues to add personnel  including additional executive officers in expectation of fda approval of its aks nda 
the company has made capital expenditures in the form of deposits for equipment to establish  if necessary  a back up  limited production line for the manufacture of kerasticks tm 
the company incurred a net loss of  or per share for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the year ended december  such losses are consistent with the company s expectations and the company anticipates that losses will continue throughout the development stage 
the company expects to incur additional operating losses  as it continues to progress with its research and development program and clinical trials  until it can develop sufficient revenues from sales of its products to cover all costs and expenses 
the company s revenues to date have been limited and substantially all of the company s revenues have consisted of interest income 
to achieve profitable operations  the company  alone or with others  must successfully develop  manufacture and market proprietary products 
there is no way to accurately predict the timing or magnitude of revenues from the marketing of levulan r pdt for any indication or whether any revenues will ever be realized 
in march  the company initiated a phase i ii multicenter clinical study examining the use of levulan r with a proprietary non laser light source and a laser for human hair removal 
significantly more research and development in necessary 
however  early clinical trial results are sufficiently positive to indicate that additional spending would be appropriate

the company has implemented sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the statements establishes standards for the way that a public business enterprise reports information about operating segments in annual financial statements and interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the company has determined that  at present  it does not have any reportable segments

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the statement is effective for the fiscal quarters of the company s fiscal year ending december  the company is in the process of evaluating the effect of this statement on its consolidated financial statements 
year compliance 
the year issue is the result of computer programs having been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computers  computer programs  and administrative equipment that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if any of the company s systems that have date sensitive software use only two digits  system failures or miscalculations may result causing disruptions to operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or send and receive electronic data with third parties or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s relatively new management information systems  which were supplied and are maintained by third parties  have been certified as year compliant 
however  because most computer systems are  by their very nature  interdependent  it is possible that non compliant third party computers could have an adverse effect on the company s computer systems 
the company can give no assurance that such third party systems do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with the year date functions that may have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operation or financial condition 
the company is in the process of contacting its key unrelated third parties to certify their year compliance 
the company expects to complete the process of obtaining certifications from unrelated third parties by june  in the event such certifications are not available  the company is developing plans to evaluate the potential impact on its operations if such third parties are unable to perform their obligations 
to the extent that such third parties are materially adversely effected by the year issue  the company could have disruptions in its operations 
the company believes that it is devoting the necessary resources to identify and resolve significant year issues in a timely manner 
the costs incurred in addressing year compliance are not considered at this time to be material and will be expensed as incurred 
year ended december  versus year ended december  the company had no sales during the year 
the company s most advanced clinical program remained levulan r pdt pd for actinic keratoses aks 
the company completed two parallel phase iii clinical trials using levulan r pdt for treatment of pre cancerous aks of the face and scalp which allowed the company to begin to prepare its first nda 
in may  the company signed an agreement with richard wolf medical instruments corp  to collaborate on the development of the company s levulan r pd process for enhanced detection of bladder cancer 
under the agreement  wolf will provide  at no cost to the company  proprietary non laser light sources and cystoscopes  along with technical and regulatory support  for the company s clinical trials for this indication 
the company and wolf intend to co operate in the marketing of the levulan r pd system for bladder cancer detection  once the appropriate approval has been received from the fda 
the company also has the right under the agreement to qualify other manufacturers light sources and or cystoscopes with the fda for use in levulan r pd of bladder cancer 
in november  the company commenced a multicenter phase i ii clinical trial levulan r pd for bladder cancer in the us the results were announced in january and the company is seeking advice of expert urologists to assist with development of future trials 
also during the year the company entered into a license agreement to develop and market an incoherent or non laser light source for possible use in its endometrial ablation clinical program 
the company paid an execution fee of pound   and has agreed to pay royalties on sales ranging from to 
the company continued plans for further clinical trials in acne and hair removal 
in addition  the company continued its pilot work on endometrial ablation  by supporting plans for a phase i ii investigator ind clinical trial
