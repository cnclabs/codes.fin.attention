item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of alaris medical and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview alaris medical is a holding company for alaris medical systems 
alaris medical also identifies and evaluates potential acquisitions and investments  and performs various corporate functions 
as a holding company  alaris medical currently has no revenues to fund its operating and interest expense and relies on its existing cash  cash generated from operations of alaris medical systems and external borrowings to meet its obligations 
capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is a leading provider of infusion systems and related technologies to the united states hospital market  with the largest installed base of pump delivery lines channels 
the company is also a leader in the international infusion systems market 
based on installed base of infusion pumps  the company has a number one or two market position in eight western european countries  the number three market position in germany  the largest installed base of infusion pumps in australia and canada and a developing position in latin america and asia 
the company s infusion systems  which are used to deliver one or more fluids  primarily pharmaceuticals or nutritionals  to patients  consist of single and multi channel infusion pumps and controllers  and proprietary and non proprietary disposable administration sets ie  plastic tubing and pump interfaces 
in addition  the company is a leading provider of patient monitoring products that measure and monitor temperature  pulse  pulse oximetry and blood pressure  with the largest installed base of hospital thermometry systems in the united states 
through its july  acquisition of instromedix  the company also designs  manufactures and sells cardiology products such as arrhythmia event recorders and pacemaker monitors 
the company sells a full range of products through a worldwide direct sales force consisting of over sales persons and through more than distributors to over  hospitals worldwide 
sales by the company s international business unit represented of the company s total sales for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company had sales of million and adjusted ebitda of million 
as a result of the merger on november   the operating results reported for the year ended december  are not comparable to the operating results and cash flows represent those of advanced medical alaris medical s predecessor and imed and include those of ivac from november  through december  in recent years  the company s results of operations have been affected by the cost containment pressures applicable to health care providers 
in particular  in order to reduce costs  certain hospitals have adopted a protocol increasing the maximum time between disposable administration set changes from every hours to as much as every hours 
notwithstanding this change in protocol  unit sales volume of the company s disposable administration sets increased in every year since  primarily as a result of the growth in its worldwide installed base of infusion pumps 
however  uncertainty remains with regard to future changes within the healthcare industry 
the trend towards managed care and economically motivated buyers in the us may result in continued pressure on selling prices of products and compression on gross margins 
the us marketplace is increasingly characterized by consolidation among healthcare providers and purchasers of medical products 
the company s profitability is affected by the increasing use of group purchasing organizations gpos which are better able to negotiate favorable pricing from providers of infusion systems  such as the company  and which insure compliance with exclusive buying arrangements for their members 
these buying arrangements  in certain situations  also may result in the gpo requiring removal of the company s existing infusion pumps 
the company expects that such gpos will become increasingly more common and may have an adverse effect on the company s future profitability 
finally  the enactment of national health care reform or other legislation affecting payment mechanisms and health care delivery could affect the company s future results of operations 
it is impossible to predict the extent to which the company may be affected by any such change in legislation

while there can be no assurances that the company will complete additional acquisitions  depending on the value of potential acquisitions  the company might fund such transactions through a variety of sources  including existing cash  new or existing debt facilities or through the sale of equity securities 
the company believes that  on both a short term and long term basis  based on current levels of performance  it will generate cash flow from operations  together with its existing cash  sufficient to fund its operations  make planned capital expenditures and make principal amortization and interest payments under the credit facility and interest payments on the notes 
however  on a long term basis  the company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the notes at maturity in the amount of million  to make scheduled payments on the senior discount notes or to repay the senior discount notes in the amount of million at maturity 
accordingly  the company may have to refinance the notes and the senior discount notes at or prior to maturity or sell assets or raise equity capital to repay such debt 
based on current interest rates and debt outstanding as of december   over the next twelve months  the company is required to make principal and interest payments under its credit facility in the amount of million and interest payments on the notes and the convertible debentures in the amount of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the company s ability to fund its operations  to make planned capital expenditures and to make scheduled principal and interest payments will be dependent on the company s future operating performance  which is itself dependent on a number of factors  many of which the company cannot control  including conditions affecting the company s foreign operations  prevailing economic conditions  availability of other sources of liquidity  and financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting the company s business and operations 
year risk the year problem arises from the use of a two digit field to identify years in computer programs  eg   and the assumption of a single century  the s 
any program so created may read  or attempt to read  as the year the company has developed  and is implementing  a comprehensive program to address year issues pertaining to both information technology it and non it systems 
the program is monitored by a steering committee comprised of representatives from key functional areas  which periodically reports to senior management and will be reporting to the board of directors throughout as to the program s status 
the program consists of identification  prioritization  remediation and post implementation phases and considers the worldwide effect of the year on the company s operations and internal systems including non information technology systems  customers  products and services  and manufacturing systems  as well as on its third party suppliers and other critical business partners 
the committee has completed its initial assessment and it is not currently aware of any material year issues related to third parties with whom the company conducts business or in its non information technology systems 
the committee s assessment will likely be a continuous process through the remainder of in addition to its customers  the company conducts business with and utilizes the services of numerous third parties including but not limited to suppliers  distributors  telecommunication companies  financial institutions  governmental agencies  and utility companies 
the company is working to identify and analyze the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios for third party relationships affected by the year the ability of these third parties to adequately address their year issues is outside the company s control 
failure by some or all of these parties to adequately address their year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company 
given the number of parties with whom the company transacts business  it is reasonably likely that some of these parties will not be able to adequately solve their year issues in a timely manner 
due to the company s inability to control third party compliance with year issues  there can be no assurances that such year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
in order to successfully provide product to its customers  the company is dependent upon the timely fulfillment of its supply orders from its chosen vendors 
the company has identified potentially critical suppliers and attempted to determine if such suppliers have identified and or addressed their own year issues by means of questionnaires 
the company is dependent on such suppliers to provide timely responses to its questionnaires and is not in a position to verify the truth or accuracy of the responses it receives to such questionnaires 
at this time  the company has not identified or been informed of any significant suppliers that will not be able to fulfill the company s orders 
however  many of the company s key suppliers have acknowledged that they must make improvements to their systems to properly deal with the year orders and issues 
as a result  there can be no assurances that key suppliers will be able to timely fill the company s future orders 
the company is in the process of evaluating what alternatives are available if key suppliers could not provide required materials and supplies to the company when ordered 
while a formal contingency plan related to this risk has not yet been completed by the company  alternatives would be to increase inventory levels of key suppliers and seek supplies from other vendors 
the company estimates that such contingency plans will be completed by december  however  there can be no assurance that all significant primary and back up suppliers will be able to fill the company s orders due to their own year issues 
such supplier failures could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows
