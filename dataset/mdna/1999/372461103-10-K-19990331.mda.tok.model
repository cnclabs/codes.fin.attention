item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements in this report which express belief  anticipation or expectation as well as other statements which are not historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including those set forth under risk factors in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in or incorporated by reference into this report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
compared to in july  the company sold selected assets and transferred selected liabilities related to the millions of electron volts mev ion implantation equipment product line to varian associates  inc varian for approximately million asset sale 
as a result of the asset sale  the company no longer engages in the ion implant business and has refocused its efforts on thin film deposition 
the company used the net proceeds of the asset sale for repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes  including investment in research development r d of thin film products 
in connection with the asset sale and the refocusing of the company s business on thin film products  the company significantly reduced the workforce at its sunnyvale  california location 
in addition  james healy resigned as president and chief executive officer of the company and william wr elder  the company s chairman  returned to a full time role as chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the components of the company s statements of operations  expressed as percentage of net sales  are as follows years ended december  net sales costs and expenses cost of goods sold research and development selling  general and administrative special charge income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss net sales for the year ended december  were million  compared to net sales of million in the primary reason for the decline in sales volume was the divestiture of the ion implant product line  which contributed million of revenue in compared to million in also  the semiconductor equipment industry continued in one of its worst recessions in  and the company s sales volumes were adversely affected by the lack of capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers due to dram overcapacity 
to strengthen the company s financial position  genus made the decision during the second quarter to sell the mev ion implant products to varian associates  inc and focus the company s resources on the thin film product line 
export sales accounted for of the company s net sales in  compared to in non system sales were of total revenue  compared to in this was attributed to significantly fewer system unit shipments in compared to  while non system revenues decreased at a slower pace 
in  the company recorded a special charge of approximately million note 
included in this special charge are personnel charges of million associated with the company s reduction in workforce as well as million in inventory write downs  and million in leasehold improvement write offs 
in addition  this charge included million for expenses associated with the closing of several sales offices and transaction losses as a result of the sale of the ion implant products to varian and million for legal  accounting  and banking fees associated with the varian transaction 
finally  the special charge included a million write off of ion implant inventory that is currently a matter of dispute with varian in connection with the asset sale 
the company and varian are in the process of resolving the dispute through arbitration to determine whether the company or varian has rights to the one ion implant sale and related inventory 
if and when the company prevails in the arbitration  any adjustments to the company s financial statements as a result of this gain contingency will be made in the quarter in which the decision is rendered and the collection from the end customer of the amount in question is probable 
the company is not conceding any rights to the disputed sale 
at december   the following cash components of the special charge remain unpaid  in payroll costs associated with the reduction in force   in foreign subsidiary closing costs  and  in transaction costs 
the company expects these amounts to be paid by the end of the second quarter of gross margin for the year ended december  was  a percentage point decline compared to in inventory and warranty reserve reversals of million during increased the gross margin percentage by 
the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributed to underabsorbed fixed operations and service costs due to depressed sales volumes during the first half of during that time  genus operated as a two product line company  with separate manufacturing facilities for each product line 
during the second half of  when the company was a focused thin film equipment provider  the gross margins from operations exclusive of the million in inventory and warranty reserve reversals taken in the fourth quarter were see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s gross margins have historically been affected by variations in average selling prices  changes in the mix of product sales  unit shipment levels  the level of foreign sales and competitive pricing pressures 
the company anticipates that these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future in light of current market conditions 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to for the year ended december  on a dollar basis  r d expenses of million for were million lower than  due to decreased expenditures associated with the mev ion implant product line which was sold in july  thin film r d spending of million in was relatively flat compared to the company serves markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing  and the company believes that it must continue to maintain its investment in r d to develop competitive products 
accordingly  the company anticipates that r d expenses will increase in the future  as we continue to invest in programs critical to our future success 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were of net sales for the year ended december   compared to of net sales for the year ended december  while the company took significant actions to reduce sg a expenses in  the decreased sales volumes adversely affected the percentage 
actual sg a expenses were million in  a million decrease over included in sg a for was a million net charge for the write off of an outstanding receivable from innotech corporation  formerly the company s japanese distributor 
in  the company had  in other expense  compared to million for the comparable period in due to the strengthening of the korean won and the japanese yen  the company recorded a foreign exchange gain of  during the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred foreign exchange losses of million due to the weakening of these two currencies 
net interest expense for the year was  compared to  for due to current market conditions  the fluctuation in the company s order rates in the last months  the company s continued reliance on one customer for a significant portion of its orders  the slowdown in the korean semiconductor market  the continued competitive market environment for the company s products  and the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment market  the company remains cautious about the prospects for its business over the next twelve months 
the company continues to make strategic investments in new product development and manufacturing improvements with a view of augmenting future performance by enhancing product offerings  however  such investments may adversely effect short term operating performance 
the company is also continuing its efforts to implement productivity improvements for future operating performance 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategic efforts will be successful 
compared to net sales for the year ended december  were million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  while sales were essentially flat on a year to year basis  the company experienced volatility on a quarterly basis during both years 
sales for the nine month period ended september  increased over the same period for as the industry and the company recovered from the slowdown in the dram market experienced during the latter half of however  in the fourth quarter of  the company s sales fell from the prior quarter due partially to the financial crisis in asia that caused some customers to push out their required delivery dates 
export sales accounted for of the company s net sales in  compared to in non system sales remained relatively flat year to year  accounting for of revenue in  compared to in during  in response to the industry slowdown  the company incurred million in special charges during the third and fourth quarters as it restructured its operations to attain profitability at a decreased sales level 
these charges reflected capacity cost reductions  including reductions in headcount  write off of some manufacturing equipment and increased inventory reserves 
during  these measures resulted in lower expenses in cost of goods sold and r d 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  a two percentage point improvement compared to for the year ended december  improvements in operating efficiencies as a result of the restructuring were mitigated by pricing pressures  especially from asian customers 
the company s gross margins have historically been affected by variations in average selling prices  changes in the mix of product sales  unit shipment levels  the level of foreign sales and competitive pricing pressures 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to for the year ended december  on a dollar basis  r d expenses during decreased million when compared to the same period in  primarily due to the restructuring 
the company serves markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing  and the company believes that it must continue to maintain its investment in r d to develop competitive products 
sg a expenses were of net sales for the year ended december   compared to of net sales for the year ended december  included in sg a for was a write off of an outstanding receivable from a malaysian customer 
absent this bad debt expense  sg a expense would have increased only approximately  or from in  the company had million in other expense  compared to  in other income for the comparable period in as a result of the asian financial crisis and the devaluation of the korean won  the company incurred a foreign exchange transaction loss of million during the fourth quarter of net interest expense for the year was  as compared to net interest income of  for as a result of higher outstanding short term borrowings and lower levels of invested cash and cash equivalents during during the fourth quarter of  management determined that  based upon the weight of available evidence as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset at december  will not be realized and  therefore  provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset resulting in a tax provision of million for the year 
accordingly  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to an effective tax rate of in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of  from the prior year 
operating activities in used cash of million  primarily due to a million net loss  a million increase in inventories  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable and non cash charges for restructuring activities and depreciation and amortization of million 
operating activities in used cash of million  primarily due to a million net loss  offset partially by non cash charges for deferred taxes of million  and operating activities in provided cash of million  primarily due to decreases in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by a million net loss and a million increase in inventories 
the company received million from the sale of its mev ion implant product line to varian  and used these funds to pay certain existing obligations  including million of accounts payable and million for the outstanding bank line of credit 
additionally  the company redeemed  shares of its series a convertible preferred stock and  shares of its redeemable series b convertible preferred stock for approximately million 
financing activities in used cash of million  primarily due to the net repayments of short term bank borrowings and the net redemptions of preferred stock 
financing activities in and provided cash of million and million  primarily due to net short term bank borrowings and proceeds from issuance of common stock 
capital expenditures during were  related primarily to acquisition of machinery and equipment for the company s r d and applications laboratories 
these expenditures were financed by the company s working capital 
the company anticipates that any additional capital expenditures in will be funded through existing working capital or lease financing 
the company s primary source of funds at december  consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents  and million of accounts receivable  most of which are expected to be collected during the first half of included in the cash balance was million in short term borrowings  utilizing the company s accounts receivable purchase agreement 
this borrowing represents the maximum amount available under that credit facility  and the million balance was repaid in january the company believes that its existing working capital and cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to satisfy its cash needs through the end of fiscal there can be no assurance that any required additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
recent account pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities as is effective for the company s fiscal year the impact of the implementation of sfas on the consolidated financial statements of the company has not yet been determined 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee acsec  released statement of position  accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop requires certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use to be capitalized  provided that those costs are not research and development 
sop is effective for the company s fiscal year  and the impact of the adoption of sop on the company s consolidated financial statements has not yet been determined 
in april  acsec released statement of position  accounting for costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires the costs of start up activities to be expensed as incurred 
start up activities are defined as those one time activities related to opening a new facility  introducing a new product or service  conducting business in a new territory  conducting business with a new class of customer  initiating a new process in an existing facility  or commencing some new operation 
sop is effective for the company s fiscal year  and the impact of the adoption of sop on the company s consolidated financial statements has not yet been determined 
financial risk management the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could seriously harm the company s financial results 
all of the company s international sales  except spare parts and service sales made by the company s subsidiary in south korea  are currently denominated in us dollars 
all spare parts and service sales made by the south korean subsidiary are won denominated 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products more expensive and  therefore  reduce the demand for the company s products 
reduced demand for the company s products could seriously harm the company s financial results 
currently  the company does not hedge against any foreign currencies 
risk factors certain sections of management s discussion and analysis contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth above in management s discussion and analysis and this risk factors section 
the discussion of these factors is incorporated by this reference as if said discussion was fully set forth in management s discussion and analysis 
historical performance 
the company has experienced losses of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result of the company s inconsistent sales and operating results in recent years  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attain or sustain consistent future revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis  or that the company will be able to attain or maintain consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
reliance on international sales 
export sales accounted for approximately  and of total net sales in the years ended  and  respectively 
in addition  net sales to south korean customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total net sales during the same periods 
the company anticipates that international sales  including sales to south korea  will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales 
as a result  a significant portion of the company s sales will be subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although the company s foreign system sales are primarily denominated in us dollars and the company does not engage in hedging transactions  the company s foreign sales are subject to the risks associated with unexpected changes in exchange rates  which could have the effect of making the company s products more or less expensive 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  the company has a wholly owned south korean subsidiary providing service and support to the installed base of customers and whose functional currency is the won 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur currency losses or gains in future quarters as the currency fluctuates 
a substantial portion of the company s sales are in asia 
recent turmoil in the asian financial markets has resulted in dramatic currency devaluations  stock market declines  restriction of available credit and general financial weakness 
in addition  dram prices have fallen dramatically and may continue to do so as some asian ic manufacturers may be selling drams at less than cost in order to raise cash 
these developments may affect the company in several ways 
currency devaluation may make dollar denominated goods  such as the company s  more expensive for asian clients 
asian manufacturers may limit capital spending 
furthermore  the uncertainty of the dram market may cause manufacturers everywhere to delay capital spending plans 
these circumstances may also affect the ability of company customers to meet their payment obligations  resulting in the cancellations or deferrals of existing orders and the limitation of additional orders 
such developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on a small number of customers and concentration of credit risk 
historically  the company has relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of its net sales 
in  three customers  samsung electronics company  ltd  advanced micro devices and micron technology  inc accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
in  three customers  samsung electronics company  ltd  m a com and sgs thomson accounted for  and  respectively of the company s cvd net sales and three customers  advanced micro devices  micron technology  inc and atmel accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s ion implantation net sales 
in  samsung electronics company  ltd 
and innotech corporation accounted for and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
additionally  three customers  samsung electronics company  ltd  philips semiconductor and atmel accounted for an aggregate of of accounts receivable at december   and three customers  samsung electronics company  ltd  micron technology  inc and innotech corporation  accounted for an aggregate of of accounts receivable at december  because the semiconductor manufacturing industry is concentrated in a limited number of generally larger companies  the company expects that a significant portion of its future product sales will be concentrated within a limited number of customers 
none of these customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase the company s products 
furthermore  sales to certain of these customers may decrease in the future when those customers complete their current semiconductor equipment purchasing requirements for new or expanded fabrication facilities 
the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders from a significant customer  including reductions due to customer departures from recent buying patterns  market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the industries that manufacture products utilizing ics  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is dependent on a small number of customers 
accordingly  the company is subject to concentration of credit risk 
if a major customer were to encounter financial difficulties and become unable to meet its obligations  the company would be adversely impacted 
cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the company s business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and experiences periodic downturns  which have an adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment 
semiconductor industry downturns have adversely affected the company s revenues  operating margins and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenues and operating results will not continue to be materially and adversely affected by future downturns in the semiconductor industry 
in addition  the need for continued investment in r d  substantial capital equipment requirements and extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capability limits the company s ability to reduce expenses 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company will be able to attain profitability in the future 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company s revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of a relatively small number of high priced systems  many of which may be ordered and shipped during the same quarter 
the company s results of operations for a particular quarter could be adversely affected if anticipated orders  for even a small number of systems  were not received in time to enable shipment during the quarter  anticipated shipments were delayed or canceled by one or more customers or shipments were delayed due to manufacturing difficulties 
the company s revenue and operating results may also fluctuate due to the mix of products sold and the channel of distribution 
competition 
the semiconductor manufacturing capital equipment industry is highly competitive 
genus faces substantial competition throughout the world 
the company believes that to remain competitive  it will require significant financial resources in order to offer a broader range of products  to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide and invest in product and process r d 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources  more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer service and support capabilities  as well as greater name recognition than the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics 
if the company s competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering cvd products similar to those sold by the company  it would materially adversely effect the company s ability to sell its products to these manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete successfully in the united states or worldwide 
the company faces direct competition in cvd wsix from applied materials  inc and tokyo electron  ltd 
there can be no assurance that these or other competitors will not succeed in developing new technologies  offering products at lower prices than those of the company or obtaining market acceptance for products more rapidly than the company 
dependence on new products and processes 
the company believes that its future performance will depend in part upon its ability to continue to enhance its existing products and their process capabilities and to develop and manufacture new products with improved process capabilities 
as a result  the company expects to continue to invest in r d 
the company also must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products could adversely effect sales of existing products 
there can be no assurance that the market will accept the company s new products or that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to its existing products and processes in a timely manner to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if the company is not successful in the development of advanced processes or equipment for manufacturers with whom it has formed strategic alliances  its ability to sell its products to those manufacturers would be adversely affected 
product concentration  rapid technological change 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change 
the company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of its wsix cvd systems 
the company estimates that the life cycle for these systems is generally three to five years 
the company believes that its future prospects will depend in part upon its ability to continue to enhance its existing products and their process capabilities and to develop and manufacture new products with improved process capabilities 
as a result  the company expects to continue to make significant investments in r d 
the company also must manage product transitions successfully  as introductions of new products could adversely effect sales of existing products 
there can be no assurance that future technologies  processes or product developments will not render the company s product offerings obsolete or that the company will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to its existing and future processes in a timely manner to satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
the failure to do so could adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if the company is not successful in the development of advanced processes or equipment for manufacturers with whom it currently does business  its ability to sell its products to those manufacturers would be adversely affected 
dependence on patents and proprietary rights 
the company s success depends in part on its proprietary technology 
while the company attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secret protection  it believes that the success of the company will depend on more technological expertise  continuing the development of new systems  market penetration and growth of its installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
the company currently has a number of united states and foreign patents and patent applications 
there can be no assurance that any patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company 
from time to time  the company has received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties patent rights by the company s products 
in such cases  it is the policy of the company to defend against the claims or negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms where considered appropriate 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
dependence on key suppliers 
certain of the components and sub assemblies included in the company s products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
disruption or termination of these sources could have a temporary adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company believes that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products  if necessary 
nevertheless  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on independent distributors 
the company currently sells and supports its cvd products through direct sales and customer support organizations in the us  western europe and south korea and through seven exclusive  independent sales representatives and distributors in the us  europe  japan  south korea  taiwan  china and malaysia 
the company does not have any long term contracts with its sales representatives and distributors 
although the company believes that alternative sources of distribution are available  the disruption or termination of its existing distributor relationships could have a temporary adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility of stock price 
the company s common stock has experienced substantial price volatility  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of  or announcements by  the company  its competitors or its customers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and other events or factors 
also  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of many technology companies  in particular  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic and political conditions in the united states and the countries in which the company does business  may adversely effect the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors could have a material adverse effect on such market price 
readiness for year many existing computer systems and applications  and other control devices  use only two digits to identify a year in the date field  without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
these computer systems and applications could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected so that they can process data related to the year the company relies on its systems  applications and devices in operating and monitoring all major aspects of its business  including financial systems such as general ledger  accounts payable and payroll modules  customer service  infrastructure  embedded computer chips  networks and telecommunications equipment and end products 
the company also relies on external systems of business enterprises such as customers  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  and of governments both domestically and globally  directly for accurate exchange of data and indirectly 
the company is currently completing the planning process for its year readiness project  although many mission critical issues have already been addressed 
the director of operations and facilities chairs the project team and it includes project managers from the finance  information technology  facilities  engineering  and customer support organizations 
the team is meeting weekly  and has conducted a thorough analysis to identify systems that will possibly be impacted by the year problem 
these systems have been classified into four major segments facilities  mission critical business operations systems  non mission critical business operations systems and general office equipment 
the project team has assigned one of its members to be the project manager for each segment  and each of these segment project managers is in the process of identifying an implementation manager for each system identified as part of their segment 
each implementation manager is responsible for developing a detailed plan that includes an assessment of year compliance  followed by phases to define a contingency plan  evaluate alternatives  select a solution  design and implement the solution and  finally  to test and verify compliance 
some of the critical systems already addressed are discussed in the following paragraphs 
end products 
the control systems for each of the company s products are computer driven 
thorough testing of these products was completed during testing addressed not only the company designed elements of the system  but also the embedded controls in manufactured components integrated into the end products 
each product requires a software upgrade  and the oldest systems in the product line require a control system computer replacement as well 
the company is charging a nominal amount for these upgrades on the older generation systems  while upgrades for the current lynx products are supplied at no charge 
the design and testing of each of these product upgrades have been completed  and the upgrades have been shipped and installed at some of the company s customer s sites worldwide 
the company has contacted and offered this upgrade to all of its customers  but some customers have decided not to upgrade their systems 
enterprise resources program 
during  the company started implementation of a new business system 
one criterion for the selection of the enterprise software was compliance with year issues 
the system was installed and implemented at the company s newburyport  ma facility in september  but implementation at the sunnyvale  ca headquarters was postponed during due to the asset sale 
the system hardware and software was recently returned to sunnyvale  and cutover from the existing system to the new system is scheduled for august  year compliance on the new system was tested on the system while it was installed in newburyport 
the system is considered to be the most critical internal company resource at risk to the year problem  so timely implementation is essential 
supplier readiness 
each implementation manager is responsible for assessing the readiness of the suppliers who support their system to ensure there will be no lapses in service that may interrupt operations 
this is in addition to addressing readiness of the hardware and software products provided by these suppliers 
suppliers of inventory material for the company s products will be surveyed during the second quarter of this is one of the projects under the mission critical business operations systems segment 
readiness of the supplier s products has already been established under the end product project  but disruption of the supply pipeline due to supplier business readiness still needs to be addressed 
preliminary discussions with some of the company s critical suppliers indicate that most are ahead of the company in establishing their own readiness 
the company s estimated expenses incurred through december  are  the projected costs are  the single largest risk element is the business system  and implementation of the new system is adequately budgeted in the company believes that costs to fix the company s products have already been fully incurred 
several capital investments have already been made in to replace aging equipment  and year compliant systems were purchased in all cases 
this includes new network and electronic mail file servers 
the company s voicemail system is not year compliant  and replacement is already budgeted as a capital improvement 
there are a number of hardware and software systems  both mission critical and non mission critical  which may require upgrades at the company s expense over the next few quarters  but preliminary estimates indicate these expenses will not be material 
there can be no assurance that the company s current estimated costs associated with the year issue  or the consequences of incomplete or untimely resolution of the year issue  will not have a material adverse effect on the result of operations or financial position of the company in any given year 
the company has not yet identified any specific contingency plans in the event that projects are not completed in time or if planned fixes fail to operate as expected 
each implementation project manager is responsible for completing contingency plans for assigned projects as part of the planning process 
at this time  the company does not plan to use any outside agencies to provide independent verification of readiness  although individual implementation project managers may decide to include independent verification as part of their project plans 
the independent verification requirement will be based on the risk associated with failure of the particular project system
