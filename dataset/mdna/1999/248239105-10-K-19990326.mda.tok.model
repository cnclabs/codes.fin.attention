overview we succeeded in to a business co founded in by john e 
bailye  the company s current president and chief executive officer 
the business was established to provide sfe solutions that would enable companies to manage  coordinate and control the activities of large sales forces in complex selling environments  primarily in the prescription only pharmaceutical industry 
today  our solutions combine software products with a wide range of specialized support services 
these services include software implementation  technical and hardware support and sales force support 
we develop  implement and service sales force software products in the united states  canada  western europe  japan  australia  new zealand and brazil through our own sales  support and technical personnel located in offices worldwide 
we generate revenues from two sources fees from support services and license fees 
service revenues  which account for a substantial majority of our revenues  consist of fees from a wide variety of contracted services which we make available to our customers  generally under multi year contracts 
we generate implementation fees from services provided to configure and implement the sales force software products for our customers 
we receive technical and hardware support fees for services related to  among other things  the operation of our customers server computers  maintenance of our customers databases  asset control and maintenance for our customers remote hardware and ongoing technical support 
technical and hardware support fees also include fees for software maintenance services such as software defect resolution  performance enhancements and  in some cases  product upgrades 
we charge fees for these maintenance services based on a percentage of applicable license fees  plus any customization fees 
we receive sales force support fees for organizing and managing support of our customers sales force  including training  telephone support and data analysis services 
ongoing support fees are generally negotiated at the commencement of a contract 
however  it is our experience that our larger customers increase the amount of services they purchase from us over time 
fees for these additional services are typically based on the labor and materials used to provide the applicable service 
we charge our customers license fees to use our proprietary computer software 
customers generally pay one time perpetual license fees based upon the number of users  the territory covered and the number of modules  or features  in the particular software licensed by the customer 
historically  we have generally recognized license fees as revenue using the percentage of completion method over a period of time that begins with execution of the license agreement and ends with the completion of initial customization and installation  if any 
however  we believe that with some of our newer sales force software products  such as forcepharma and salesplus  our customers will not require customization and therefore we may be able to recognize license fees from these products upon delivery 
we recognize additional license fees when customers agree to license additional functions or enhancements  acquire an upgraded version of dendrite s software and or when the maximum permitted number of users or initial geographic coverage is exceeded 
all license fees  domestic and export  are included under the heading license fees united states in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the united states  the united kingdom and france are our main markets 
we generated approximately of our total revenues outside the united states during the year ended december   approximately during the year ended december   and approximately during the year ended december  this decrease in the percentage of revenues generated outside the united states during was principally due to very strong revenue growth in our pharmaceutical and cpg businesses in the united states 
we bill services provided by our foreign branches and subsidiaries in local currency 
license fees for our products are generally billed in us dollars regardless of where they originate 
foreign license fees are shown as united states export revenues in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating results generated in local currencies are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate in effect for the reporting period 
our operating profits by geographic segments are shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our geographic operating profits are affected primarily by our use of technical and support personnel to support service revenues  costs associated with opening new or expanding existing facilities and our ability to increase service revenues faster than the growth in selling  general and administrative expenses 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license fees services costs of revenues cost of license fees cost of services gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development write off in process research and development 
operating income loss other income income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with current year presentations 
during the second quarter of  we determined that costs associated with certain activities that were previously classified as research and development expense should be classified as cost of services as these expenditures relate to client specific activities 
for consistency of presentation  all prior periods have been reclassified 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased  or from  in to  in license fee revenues increased from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of revenue related to license fees from several significant contracts in the pharmaceutical division  sales to new customers in our consumer business division and increased sales of third party software 
service revenues increased from  in to  in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in our installed base of sales force software products at both new and existing customers  the commencement of major product rollouts  as well as the provision of additional services to our existing customers 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased  or from  in to  in cost of license fees increased from  in to  in cost of license fees for represents the amortization of capitalized software development costs of  and third party vendor license fees of  cost of license fees for represents the amortization of capitalized software development costs of  and third party vendor license fees of  the increase in the amortization of capitalized software development costs in was due to the increase in gross capitalized software development costs in as compared to the increase in third party vendor license fees in was attributable to the increase in third party software sales in cost of services increased from  in to  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in staff required to support greater client activity including the use of higher cost consultants and contractors 
as a percentage of service revenues  however  cost of services decreased from of service revenues in to in this decrease was primarily the result of increased operational efficiencies in as well as unusually high costs in the first quarter of associated with the carry over effect of expenses initially incurred in the fourth quarter of as discussed under years ended december  and cost of revenues 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to increased staff required for sales and support operations 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses decreased from in to in  due to leveraging the fixed cost elements in general and administrative expenses over a higher revenue base 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from  in to  in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses remained relatively constant 
the increase in research and development expenses during the most recent period was primarily attributable to increased spending on development of our cpg products  the continued development of forcemultiplierx and the development of our next generation pharmaceutical sales force software product  forcepharma 
with respect to future research and development expenses  subject to market conditions  we currently anticipate that such expenses will be approximately to of revenues 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future operating results our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may not meet market expectations and factors that may affect future operating results we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or respond to technological change in this item write off of in process research and development costs 
we incurred a one time charge of  to record the write off of in process research and development costs resulting from the acquisition of abc 
this amount represents the estimated fair values  based on an independent appraisal  related to in process research and development projects which had not yet reached technological feasibility 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate  excluding the impact of the write off of in process research and development which is not tax deductible  was reduced to during as opposed to during this decrease was due primarily to the implementation of tax minimization strategies throughout the world 
acquisition of abc 
on july   we acquired of the capital stock of abc for a combination of cash and stock equivalent to approximately  and transaction costs of  the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  whereby the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities of abc based on their respective fair market values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was assigned to identifiable intangibles 
we assigned  to in process research and development and such amount was written off in the accompanying statement of operations 
we also recorded  as capitalized software and  as goodwill 
abc s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased  or from  in to  in license fee revenues decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily attributable to the recognition of revenue related to license fees for a major european client during  partially offset by the inclusion of  in revenue associated with the resale of third party software during versus  in revenue associated with the resale of third party software during service revenues increased from  in to  in this increase was primarily the result of an increase in our installed base of sales force software products with new and existing customers and the provision of additional services to our existing customers  largely in the us  where the service revenue increase was  or 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased from  in to  in cost of license fees increased from  in to  in in  the cost of license fees represents the amortization of capitalized costs of  and third party vendor license fees of  in  the cost of license fees represents the amortization of capitalized costs of  and third party vendor license fees of  cost of services increased from  in to  in  primarily due to an increase in the number of service representatives and technical staff from the prior year 
the increase was necessary to support the increased client activity during the year 
as a percentage of service revenues  cost of services decreased from of service revenues in to of service revenues in this decrease was due to certain events which occurred in  including multiple customer delayed implementations for which we had hired personnel for training  customer service and technical support  costs associated with retaining a significant number of independent contractors to complete client deliverables  delayed customer license purchase and upgrade decisions  and increased research and development spending 
as a result of these factors  we incurred a net loss of million in the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased from  in to  in as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses decreased from in to in this decrease was attributable to the fixed nature of certain sg a costs  such as rent and corporate salaries  as revenues increase 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased from  in to  in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses in was consistent with our intentions  as peak development efforts associated with several new software products decreased as these software products neared completion 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate was reduced to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   excluding the impact of the write off of in process research and development which is not tax deductible 
the reduction was due to the higher base of net income relative to the amount of non deductible expenses in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statement of operations data expressed in us dollars for our eight most recently ended fiscal quarters 
this data has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
our results of operations for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any future period 
our quarterly results have varied considerably in the past and are likely to vary from quarter to quarter in the future

net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to higher net income  as well as more efficient accounts receivable and liability management during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was  in the year ended december   compared to cash obtained from investing activities of  in the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the increase in short term investments as well as the purchase of abc in the year ended december  on january   dendrite s board of directors the board of directors or the board approved a stock buy back program initially limited to  which  subject to further board review and approval  could be increased to a maximum of  but not greater than of dendrite s outstanding shares of common stock 
during the twelve month period ending december   dendrite repurchased  shares of common stock for a value of  dendrite did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the period ending december  we obtained  of cash from financing activities in the year ended december   compared to the use of  in cash from financing activities in the year ended december  the change in our cash provided from financing activities was due to an increase in the issuance of common stock  primarily from the exercise of employee stock options during the year ended december  and open market purchases of our common stock during the year ended december  we recently entered into a  revolving line of credit agreement with the chase manhattan bank  na the agreement is available to finance working capital needs and possible future acquisitions 
the  line of credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth  among other covenants  measured quarterly  which is equal to our net worth as of december  plus of our net income earned after january  and plus of the net proceeds to us of any stock offering 
this covenant effectively limits the amount of cash dividends we may pay 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
our working capital was approximately  at december  and  at december  we have no significant capital spending or purchasing commitments other than normal purchase commitments and commitments under facility and capital leases 
on january   dendrite filed a registration statement on form s the registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to register a proposed offering of  shares of common stock by the company and an additional  shares of common stock by certain selling stockholders named in the registration statement 
dendrite will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock being sold by the selling stockholders 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire products or businesses complementary to our operations 
such acquisition opportunities  if they arise  and are successfully completed  may involve the use of cash or equity instruments 
we currently have no agreements to make any acquisitions 
year readiness disclosure the efficient operation of our business is dependent in part on our internal computer software and operating systems collectively  our internal programs and systems 
since  as part of our year compliance plan  we have been evaluating our internal programs and systems to identify potential year compliance problems 
we have tested our internal programs and systems to verify year compliance 
as a result of the testing  we have determined that some of our internal programs and systems are not year compliant 
we have begun and will continue to modify or replace some of our internal programs and systems to make them year compliant 
we are also communicating with our suppliers and others to coordinate year conversion and are requesting assurances from all software vendors from which we may purchase or license software that such software will correctly process all date information at all times 
to date  we have spent approximately  to evaluate  test and remediate  if necessary  our internal programs and systems for year compliance problems and we expect to spend up to an additional  through the end of second quarter of we will fund these costs with cash from our operations 
to date  we have not spent any material amount on evaluating the year compliance status of our software products and software products licensed to its customers 
although we do not anticipate any future material expenditures  our customers may require us to incur additional expenses associated with remediating their software products 
we expect that the expenses and capital expenditures associated with achieving year compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that we will be able to achieve year compliance through a combination of modification of some existing internal programs and systems and the replacement of other internal programs and systems with new programs and systems that are already year compliant 
we expect to have our year compliance program substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of however  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful or completed in a timely manner 
we believe most of our sales force software products that we currently offer to customers are year compliant 
we define year compliant to mean that the applicable dendrite product is capable of recognizing and processing date data beyond the year as belonging to the correct century  so long as all products for example  hardware  firmware  and software including interfacing programs  operating systems  and database engines used with the software are year compliant and properly exchange date data with our products 
some of our older products will not  and some may not  accurately process dates beyond december  to the extent any of these products are still in use in  we will continue to attempt to migrate our customers to products which are year compliant 
we cannot assure you that this will occur 
a failure to migrate any such customer to a product which is year compliant could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may also experience increased expenses which we cannot recoup from current customers in addressing their migration to software that is year compliant 
we have strongly encouraged each customer to have its product tested by us for year compliance 
because of our relatively advanced state of readiness  we have not yet formulated a reasonably likely worst case scenario 
during the second quarter of  as we assess our state of readiness for january   we expect to formulate this scenario and to prepare a contingency plan  if warranted 
for a discussion of the risks associated with the year  please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future operating results we are exposed to risks associated with the year year readiness disclosure in this item factors that may affect future operating results our business is heavily dependent on the pharmaceutical industry most of our sales force software products and services  also referred to as sales force effectiveness or sfe solutions  are currently used in connection with the marketing and sale of prescription only drugs 
this market is undergoing a number of significant changes 
these include consolidations and mergers which may reduce the number of our existing and potential customers  reclassification of formerly prescription only drugs to permit their over the counter sale  competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical customers resulting from the continuing shift to delivery of healthcare through managed care organizations  and changes in law  such as government mandated price reductions for prescription only drugs  that affect the healthcare systems in the countries where our customers and potential customers are located 
we cannot assure you that we can respond effectively to any or all of these and other changes in the marketplace 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
see business industry overview for a discussion of the pharmaceutical industry sales environment 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may not meet market expectations our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to lengthy sales and implementation cycles for our products  our fixed expenses in relation to our fluctuating revenues and variations in our customers budget cycles  each of which is discussed below 
as a result  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in some future period our results of operations may be below the expectations of the public market analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock may decline 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for detailed information on our quarterly operating results 
our lengthy sales and implementation cycles make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues the selection of a sales force software product often entails an extended decision making process because of the strategic implications and substantial costs associated with a customer s license of the software 
given the importance of the decision  senior levels of management often are involved and  in some instances  the board of directors may be involved in this process 
as a result  the decision making process typically takes nine to twelve months  although in some cases it may take even longer 
accordingly  we cannot control or predict the timing of our execution of contracts with customers 
in addition  an implementation process of three to six months is customary before the software is rolled out to a customer s sales force 
however  if a customer were to delay or extend its implementation process  our quarterly revenues may decline below expected levels and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our fixed costs may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results if revenues fall below expectations we establish our expenditure levels for product development  sales and marketing and some of our other operating expenses based in large part on our expected future revenues and anticipated competitive conditions 
in particular  we frequently add staff in advance of new business to permit adequate time for training 
if the new business is subsequently delayed or canceled  we will have incurred expenses without the associated revenue 
in addition  we may increase sales and marketing expenses if competitive pressures become greater than we currently anticipate 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies directly with our actual revenues  our operating results and profitability are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected if our revenues fall below expectations 
our business is affected by variations in our customers budget cycles we have historically realized a greater percentage of our license fees and service revenues in the second half of the year than in the first half because  among other things  our customers typically spend more of their annual budget authorization for sfe solutions in the second half of the year 
however  the relationship between the amounts spent in the first and second halves of a year may vary from year to year and from customer to customer 
in addition  changes in our customers budget authorizations may reduce the amount of revenues we receive from the license of additional software or the provision of additional services 
as a result  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we depend on a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenues we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers considering all affiliates of each customer as part of that customer 
approximately of our total revenues in came from pfizer  johnson johnson and parke davis 
approximately of our total revenues in came from pfizer  johnson johnson and rhone poulenc rorer 
approximately of our total revenues in came from pfizer  eli lilly and rhone poulenc rorer 
we believe that the costs to our customers of switching to a competitor s software product  or of taking significant system management functions in house  are substantial 
nevertheless  some of our customers have switched  and in the future other customers may switch  to software products and or services offered by our competitors 
if any of our major customers were to make such a change  our business  operating results or financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to successfully introduce new products or respond to technological change the market for sales force software products changes rapidly because of frequent improvements in computer hardware and software technology 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use available technologies and data sources to develop new products and services and to enhance our current products and services  introduce new solutions that keep pace with developments in our target markets  and address the changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements that respond to technological advances in the marketplace  or that we will do so in a timely fashion 
we also cannot assure you that our products will adequately and competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
competition for software products has been characterized by shortening product cycles 
we may be materially and adversely affected by this trend if the product cycles for our products prove to be shorter than we anticipate 
if that happens  our business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected 
to remain competitive  we also may have to spend more of our revenues on product research and development than we have in the past 
as a result  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
further  our software products are technologically complex and may contain previously undetected errors or failures 
such errors have occurred in the past and we cannot assure you that  despite our testing  our new products will be free from errors 
errors that result in losses or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we are exposed to risks associated with the year year readiness disclosure demand for our software products and services may decline before and after the year a substantial amount of demand for our software may come from customers in the process of replacing and upgrading software applications to accommodate the change in date to the year this demand has contributed to our sales growth and we expect it to contribute to our sales growth 
once customers have completed these activities  we may experience a deceleration in revenue growth 
in addition  the expense and time associated with remediation efforts by customers to address year compliance problems for software products other than ours may cause our customers to delay the purchase of  or reduce the amount they spend on  our products and services  both before and after january  such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
our year remediation efforts may not be successful as part of our year compliance plan  we have assessed the readiness of our internal computer software programs and operating systems 
we believe our programs and systems will be substantially year compliant by the end of the second quarter of however  if additional defects  including defects in hardware  are identified or if necessary modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year problem could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may incur material expenses in connection with any claim relating to year compliance of our own products or the products of third parties we believe most of the sales force software products that we currently offer to our customers  prior to any customization  are year compliant 
we cannot assure you  however  that our current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functionality that may result in material costs to us 
some of our older products will not  and some may not  accurately process dates after december  to the extent any of these products are still in use in  we will continue to attempt to migrate our customers to products that are year compliant 
we cannot assure you that this will occur 
a failure to migrate any customer to a product that is year compliant could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may also experience increased expenses which we cannot recoup from current customers in addressing their migration to software that is year compliant 
we may incur additional expenses associated with remediating software products of our current customers 
in addition  some of our customers may attempt to hold us responsible for year compliance of hardware or software not supplied or created by us  but used in conjunction with one or more of our products 
for example  our customers computer hardware and software  with which our software must interface  may not properly handle date information after the year without error or interruption 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year readiness disclosure for detailed information on our state of readiness  potential risks and contingency plans regarding the year issue 
increased competition may result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services we believe there are approximately ten other companies that sell sales force software products and specifically target the pharmaceutical industry  including four competitors that are actively selling sales force software products in more than one country  and three competitors that also offer sales force support services 
we believe that most of our competitors offer sales force software products and or services that do not address the variety of customer needs that our solutions address 
however  these competing solutions may cost less than our solutions 
we also face competition from many vendors that market and sell sales force automation and sfe solutions in the consumer packaged goods or cpg market 
in addition  we also compete with various companies that provide support services similar to our services 
we believe our ability to compete depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the number and success of new market entrants supplying competing sales force products or support services  expansion of product lines by  or consolidation among  our existing competitors  and development and or operation of in house sales force software products or services by our customers and potential customers 
some of our competitors and potential competitors are part of large corporate groups and have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  sales  marketing  technology and other resources than we have 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
see business competition for detailed information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate 
some of our customers rely on our competitors for market data current market data on the sales of prescription only pharmaceutical products is an important element for the operation of our sales force software products in the prescription only pharmaceutical industry 
our customers use this data to guide and organize their sales forces and marketing efforts 
some of the leading purveyors of this market information compete with us either directly or through affiliates or may compete with us in the future 
if these purveyors of market information require pharmaceutical companies to use their sales force products and or services  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations have risks that our domestic operations do not the sale of our products and services in foreign countries accounts for  and is expected in the future to account for  a material part of our revenues 
these sales are subject to risks inherent in international business activities  including any adverse change in the political or economic environments in these countries  economic instability  any adverse change in tax  tariff and trade or other regulations  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  exposure to exchange rate risk for service revenues which are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  and difficulties in managing an organization spread over various jurisdictions 
our success depends on retaining our key senior management team and on attracting and retaining qualified personnel our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the contributions of our executive officers and key sales  technical and customer service personnel 
we maintain a million key man insurance policy on john e 
bailye  our president and chief executive officer  the proceeds of which are payable to dendrite 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
we have at times experienced difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel and we may experience such difficulties in the future 
any such difficulties could adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
see management for detailed information concerning our key personnel 
our inability to manage our growth could adversely affect our business to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to strengthen our operational  financial and management information systems and expand  train and manage our work force 
however  we may not be able to do so effectively or on a timely basis 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results or financial condition 
our business depends on proprietary technology that we may not be able to protect completely we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we take will prevent misappropriation of this technology 
further  protective actions we have taken or will take in the future may not prevent competitors from developing products with features similar to our products 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we have  on occasion  in response to a request by our customer  entered into agreements which require us to place our source code in escrow to secure our service and maintenance obligations 
further  we believe that our products and trademarks do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future that may result in the imposition of damages or injunctive relief against us 
in addition  any such claims may require us to enter into royalty arrangements 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we have limited experience in marketing to the consumer packaged goods market we market and sell sfe solutions to companies in the cpg market 
the selling environment in this market has unique characteristics that differentiate it from the pharmaceutical market 
in addition  we believe that the cpg market is composed of sub markets  each of which may have unique characteristics 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to replicate in this market the success we have achieved in the ethical pharmaceutical market 
provisions of our charter documents and new jersey law may discourage an acquisition of dendrite provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  our by laws and new jersey law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
for example  the board of directors may  without the consent of the stockholders  issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock 
our common stock may be subject to price fluctuations the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors the announcement or the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results and changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in the technology  healthcare and other growth sectors  and general consolidation in the healthcare information industry which may result in the market perceiving us or other comparable companies as potential acquisition targets 
further  the stock market has experienced on occasion extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the equity securities of many technology companies have been especially volatile and often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
see price range of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk because we have operations in a number of countries  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency rates change  translation of the income statements of our international entities from local currencies to us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge translation risks because we generally reinvest the cash flows from international operations 
management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by less than  this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one area may be offset by gains from another area 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for members of the european monetary union took place on january  we have not determined what impact  if any  the euro has on our foreign exchange exposure 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of investment 
as of december   our investments consisted primarily of commercial paper maturing in the first four months of due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of the company s investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income  of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our investments
