the sum of the four quarters earnings per share may not agree to the fiscal year earnings per share due to rounding

historically  the company has met these liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operating activities and with borrowed funds under the company s million revolving credit facility revolving credit facility 
due to the seasonal demand for the company s products  the company builds inventory during the company s first fiscal quarter in advance of the typically stronger selling periods during the company s second  third and fourth fiscal quarters 
the revolving credit facility consists of an unsecured line of credit agreement with one bank  which provides a total loan commitment not to exceed million  all of which was available to the company as of september  the line of credit borrowings are at the applicable bank s base rate at june  
the line of credit agreement expires on february  under the revolving credit facility  the company is subject to certain customary restrictive financial requirements 
the company has been and is in compliance with all such financial covenants as of september  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
because of the seasonality of the company s business  more funds from operating activities are generated in its third and fourth fiscal quarters 
accounts payable increased million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of an increase in the length of payment terms from a principal supplier and increases in normal operations 
accounts receivable increased by million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  while sales increased million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal year was primarily due to the timing of payments from customers in connection with the company s dating programs and increased sales 
inventories increased  primarily as a result of an overall increase in inventory levels relating to increased sales 
the company s total capital expenditures were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the million of capital expenditures for fiscal year included expenditures for the construction of the new distribution facility  and the purchase of computerized machining equipment and office equipment 
the company anticipates making capital expenditures of million in fiscal year primarily for the construction of its new distribution facility and additional capital equipment to increase the company s production capacity  and the installation of a new computer system and related software to automate its existing warehouse management system 
the company believes that funds generated from operations and funds available under the revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet its working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal year compliance computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors that use only two digits to identify a year in a date field may be unable to process accurately certain date based information at or after the year this is commonly referred to as the year or yk issue  and the company is addressing this issue on several different fronts 
first  the company has requested year compliance certification from each of its major vendors and suppliers for their hardware or software products and for their internal business applications and processes 
second  the company has established a separate team to coordinate solutions to the year issue for its own internal information systems  for which it has completed substantially all remediation for year compliance in the fourth calendar quarter of as part of its initial phase of its year readiness  the company installed oracle applications and database 
in order to complete the year readiness program for its information systems  the company upgraded its existing oracle applications version to release amounts incurred in connection with the year compliance program were not material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company does not believe that its business will be adversely affected by the year issue in any material respect 
nevertheless  achieving year compliance is dependent on many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control  including without limitation  the availability and cost of trained personnel and effectiveness of software upgrades used by the company and its vendors and suppliers 
should either the company s internal systems or the internal systems of one or more significant vendors or suppliers fail to achieve year compliance  the company s business and its results of operations could be adversely affected 
for year issues which  if not timely resolved  could have a significant impact on the company s operations  the company has developed contingency plans 
these plans include utilizing alternative vendors and service providers and have been designed to minimize the impact of failure to achieve year compliance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s exposure to interest rate changes is primarily related to its variable rate debt which may be outstanding from time to time under the company s revolving credit facility with bank of america  nt sa 
the company s revolving credit facility is a million line of credit with an interest rate based on the prime rate currently 
it expires on february  because the interest rate on the revolving credit facility is variable  the company s cash flow may be affected by increases in the prime rate 
management does not  however  believe that any risk inherent in the variable rate nature of the loan is likely to have a material effect on the company 
as of the end of fiscal and as of september   the company s outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was zero 
even if the company were to draw down on the line prior to its expiration and an unpredicted increase in the prime rate occurred  it would not be likely to have a material effect 
sensitivity analysis 
to assess exposure to interest rate changes  the company has performed a sensitivity analysis assuming the company had million balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
the monthly interest payment  if the rate stayed constant  would be  if the prime rate rose basis points  the monthly interest payment would equal  the company does not believe the risk resulting from such fluctuations is material nor that the payment required would have material effect on cash flow
