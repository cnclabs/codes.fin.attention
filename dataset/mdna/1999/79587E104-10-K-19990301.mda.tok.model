the primary reason for lower gross profit was lower sales

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency transactions and translation of financial statements a substantial portion of the company s non us transactions are denominated in french francs 
although sames france is not typically subject to significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses  its financial statements are translated into us dollars as part of the company s consolidated financial reporting 
fluctuations in the french franc us dollar exchange rate therefore will affect the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
at november   the french franc had appreciated relative to the us dollar by approximately compared to the prior year end  however  the average french franc us dollar exchange rate was lower in fiscal than in fiscal the company also has operations in japan and sweden  where transactions are denominated in japanese yen and swedish krona 
in fiscal  the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment account  which is a component of stockholders equity  was an unrealized gain of 
million 
unrealized foreign currency translation losses of million and million were recorded in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
foreign currency exchange transactions have not typically resulted in significant gains or losses  although sames france recorded a gain of 
million in fiscal the company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to manage currency exchange rate risks and no such instruments were outstanding as of november  quarterly fluctuations the company has experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates that those fluctuations will continue 
the fluctuations have been caused primarily by periodic changes in the components of the company s sales mix 
in particular  the company s sales of large automotive installations can fluctuate substantially and they generally result in relatively lower gross profit margins 
sales of standard products and spare parts typically generate relatively higher gross profit margins 
the company therefore believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance
