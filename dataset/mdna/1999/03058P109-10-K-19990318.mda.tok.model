united security bancorporation year the year problem 
the century date change creates a problem because some computer programs and systems were designed to store calendar years with only two numbers  rather than four numbers 
computer programs and systems may recognize a date using as rather than the year the extent of the impact of this year problem is not yet known and could affect the global economy and every organization 
usbn is addressing these issues 
the challenges faced by usbn 
the year problem is of concern to usbn and other financial institutions because most financial transactions including interest accruals and payments are date sensitive 
the year problem could impact all automated systems including automated teller machines  alarm systems  and vaults 
some systems are more difficult to assess and repair 
usbn s state of readiness 
usbn is reviewing its automated systems and business processes to identify and correct any date related problems that may arise with the change of the century at december  in september  usbn and the provider of usbn s mainframe computer applications completed an installation and upgrade of the mainframe operating systems to comply with changes for the year testing of the new software will continue through september  usbn also continues to review its pc hardware and software and its major automated systems suppliers for year compliance 
a small number of pcs and pc systems required upgrades  which has been completed 
third party concerns 
usbn has numerous customers  vendors  and third party service providers whose failure to address the year problem may create significant business disruption and costs to usbn 
it is impossible for any one party to eliminate the risks related to the year problem 
it is possible that usbn s service could be disrupted through the loss of electric power  phone service  or other reasons outside of usbn s control 
usbn is in contact with its outside providers of services on an ongoing basis to evaluate their progress in addressing the year problem 
the banks are incorporating year issues into their standards of creditworthiness for new and renewed loans and are reviewing significant existing borrowers for year risk 
review in this area will continue through no significant risks have been identified 
estimated cost 
the cost of complying with the year issues is estimated to be  including staff time expenses 
about  of this amount has already been incurred 
usbn s contingency plans 
usbn is in the process of developing and implementing contingency plans to handle the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
since these worst case scenarios are difficult or even impossible to predict at this time  these contingency plans are particularly challenging 
usbn intends to develop contingency plans that are reasonably necessary to address the year problem and to revise them as necessary on an ongoing basis until the problem is confronted and resolved 
united security bancorporation liquidity and capital resources management believes that usbn s cash flow will be sufficient to support its existing operations for the foreseeable future 
if usbn needs additional liquidity  it would be required to borrow or issue additional capital stock 
usbn s ability to incur indebtedness is limited by government regulations and its ability to service borrowings is dependent upon the availability of dividends from the banks and nonbank subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by the banks is subject to limitations imposed by law and governmental regulations 
the banks may borrow on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds 
bank borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets 
at december  usbn had approximately million of unused lines of credit available for liquidity purposes 
usbn s total stockholders equity increased to  at december   from  at december  and  at december  at december   stockholders equity was of total assets  compared to at december  at december   usbn held cash and cash equivalent assets of million 
at december   virtually all of usbn s securities million were available for sale 
the capital levels of usbn and each of the banks currently exceeded applicable regulatory capital guidelines at december  effects of inflation and changing prices 
the primary impact of inflation on usbn s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs and operating overhead 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets  and if significant  would require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than would otherwise be necessary 
new accounting pronouncements 
the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

the standard becomes effective january  for usbn  and is not anticipated to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operation 
usbn does not use interest rate risk management products such as interest rate swaps  hedges  or derivatives  nor does management intend to use such products in the future 
the financial accounting standards board also issued sfas no

united security bancorporation item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management considers interest rate risk to be a market risk that could have a significant effect on the financial condition and results of operations of usbn 
usbn does not use derivatives including forward and futures contracts  options  and swaps to manage its market and interest rate risks 
all of usbn s transactions are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of usbn s loan portfolio have interest rates  which float with the lending bank s reference interest rate 
fixed rate loans are generally made with a term of five years or less 
general economic conditions  regulatory policy and competition in the marketplace affect interest income and cost of funds 
the banks operating strategies focus on asset liability management 
the purpose of asset liability management alm is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the banks and usbn s earnings from undue interest rate risk 
each of the banks follows an alm policy for controlling exposure to interest rate risk 
the alm policy is established by a committee in each bank and is reviewed  approved and administered by the asset liability committee of usbn 
the alm policy is also designed to maintain an appropriate balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to maximize interest rate spreads 
the banks monitor the sensitivity of their assets and liabilities with respect to changes in interest rates and maturities  and direct the allocation of their funds accordingly 
the strategy of each bank has been to maintain  to the extent possible  a balanced position between assets and liabilities  and to place emphasis on the sensitivity of its assets 
the following table presents estimated maturity or pricing information indicating usbn s exposure to interest rate changes as of december  the expected maturities take into consideration historical and estimated principal prepayments for loans and securities 
principal prepayments are the amounts of principal reduction in addition to contractual amortization 
fixed rate and variable rate loans are expected to have payment rates of     and for the following five years  respectively 
securities principal payments are based on payment speeds as of december  the expected maturities for financial liabilities with no stated maturity reflect historical and estimated future roll off rates 
the anticipated annual roll off rates for noninterest bearing deposits  interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits is 
the interest rates disclosed are based on rates from results 
fair values are based on the calculations used in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as disclosed in the financial statements
