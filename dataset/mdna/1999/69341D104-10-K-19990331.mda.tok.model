item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company offers placement  purchase and leasing alternatives to customers interested in acquiring the heart laser system 
in placement transactions  an installation fee is paid when the heart laser system is shipped and the company then receives a procedure fee per use 
typically  customers commit to pay for a minimum number of procedures during the term of a placement agreement 
sterile handpieces and other disposables are included in the procedure fee 
revenues from these contracts are classified as placement fees 
the cost of the heart laser system  which is owned by the company  is depreciated over the term of the placement agreement 
the heart laser system is also sold to customers  and the related sterile handpieces and other disposables are sold separately for each procedure 
the company sells the heart laser system directly and through distributors 
these sales are classified as product sales 
in september  the company entered into an exclusive agreement with ge capital trans leasing ge capital to provide a broad array of lease financing alternatives to us hospitals interested in acquiring the heart laser system 
the lease financing alternatives available through ge capital are expected to complement the company s traditional placement and sales strategies 
in addition  ge capital agreed to monetize certain prospective domestic placement agreements by providing funding to the company in an amount equal to the present value of minimum procedure payments contained in such agreements  subject to approval of creditworthiness and other terms 
no revenue was recognized on such transactions in no assurance can be given that the company will recognize any revenue as a result of its agreement with ge capital 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   product sales of  decreased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  the major factor in these decreases is the decline in the number of sales transactions 
in  the company recorded revenue on six sales compared with revenue recognition on ten sales in placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  decreased from placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  although the company increased the number of its placement contracts in  revenue from these contracts decreased 
in may  the health care financing administration hcfa instituted a non coverage policy for tmr procedures performed on medicare patients in the united states 
the hcfa announcement  coupled with delays in the fda pre market approval pma process  caused the company to examine its contractual requirements during and amend substantially all of its placement contracts  temporarily replacing contractual minimal billings with actual usage billings 
following receipt of the pma from the fda on august   placement contracts that provide for minimum billings were reinstated  and the company is renegotiating those placement agreements that do not provide for minimum billings following fda approval 
in february  hcfa announced its intention to provide coverage for tmr but did not specify an effective date for such coverage 
total gross profit decreased to  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with  or of total revenues for the year ended december  this decrease has resulted from three factors 
first  the decrease in revenue in generated fewer gross margin dollars as compared to second  the company produced fewer heart laser systems than planned in  resulting in unfavorable manufacturing variances 
these unfavorable manufacturing variances are expected to continue until production increases to levels which will fully absorb manufacturing overhead 
third  depreciation on heart laser systems shipped pursuant to placement contracts increased at a greater rate than the corresponding revenue generated from placement contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared with  for the year ended december  the increase in reflects sales and marketing expenses incurred to initiate rapid commercialization of the heart laser system upon receipt of the pma 
research and development expenditures of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared with  for the year ended december  the decrease in compared to reflects the reduced demands for clinical study compilation and data preparation following the fda panel recommendation of approval for the heart laser system  offset in part by higher costs associated with the development of new products 
other income of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared to  for the year ended december   primarily because of gains recorded in connection with foreign currency transactions 
there was no provision for income tax for the years ended december  or due to the net losses of  and  respectively 
the company incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of  compared with a net loss of  for the year ended december  the larger net loss resulted from lower total revenues and lower gross margin dollars in when compared with year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to total revenues of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   product sales of  decreased  or when compared to product sales of  for the year ended december  the major factors in both of these decreases were declines in the number of heart laser systems sold and the customer mix 
in  the company recorded revenue on sales of ten heart laser systems  including two sold directly and eight sold to distributors 
in  the company recorded revenue on thirteen sales  six of which were sold directly and seven of which were sold to distributors 
heart laser systems sold directly to customers typically generate higher revenues than those sold to distributors 
placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  increased over placement and service fees of  for the year ended december  gross profit decreased to  or of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared with  or of total revenues for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from three factors 
first  fixed manufacturing costs increased in and production levels decreased  resulting in unfavorable manufacturing variances 
second  the company sold fewer units under its sales strategy in than in and the mix was primarily to distributors in as compared to direct sales in heart laser systems sold directly to customers typically carry a higher gross profit than those sold to distributors 
third  depreciation on heart laser systems shipped pursuant to placement contracts increased at a greater rate than the corresponding revenue generated from placement contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared with  for the year ended december  the company incurred significant expenses to prepare for an fda panel review of its pma application for the heart laser system 
in addition  the company expanded its management team and its sales force 
research and development expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared with  for the year ended december  these expenditures were incurred in connection with the company s clinical study compilation and data preparation for fda submissions and an fda panel review 
these activities required additional staffing and consultants 
other income of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to  for the year ended december  primarily because of an increase in interest expense 
in july and august  the company received million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible debentures 
there was no provision for income tax for the years ended december  and due to net losses of  and  respectively 
the company incurred a net loss for the year ended december  of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the increased loss resulted from lower total revenues in compared with  combined with higher overall expenses in related to preparation for an fda panel review of the heart laser system 
liquidity and capital resources during and the company incurred significant operating losses and utilized significant amounts of cash to fund operations 
the company is reaching a critical stage in its growth as it transitions from a research and development company to a commercial company with complete sales  marketing and production capabilities 
during this time the company increased its overall operating expenses and overhead to be positioned to further increase its sale and production capabilities in anticipation of possible fda approval 
in order to be adequately positioned to meet these demands  the company obtained equity financing 
the company continues to seek equity financing as its primary means of funding operations during this transition 
on march   the company announced that it had obtained a provisional equity financing commitment of million from a major institutional investor 
the commitment contemplates the sale by the company of up to million in common stock during consecutive day periods at prices based on the trailing volume weighted average price of the common stock on the american stock exchange on each day during such periods  less a seven percent discount 
the company is unable to use the commitment on any trading day to the extent that the volume weighted average price of the company s common stock is less than per share  unless the company and the investor mutually agree to a reduction in such price 
if the company is unable to use the commitment on any given trading day  the commitment amount is automatically reduced by  on such day 
the use of the commitment is also dependent upon the company being eligible to sell shares of its common stock under a form s registration statement under the securities act of  as amended  which form requires  among other things  that the company have a market capitalization of at least million held by non affiliates of the company during the immediately preceding day period 
as of march   the company had sold  shares of common stock under this commitment  resulting in net proceeds to the company of  as of march   the company is unable to utilize this commitment due to its stock price 
while the company anticipates being able to utilize this commitment or obtain other sources of equity financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional equity financing or that the company will maintain its eligibility to use form s to the extent that the company raises additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities  ownership dilution to the stockholders will result 
during the second half of  the company implemented a number of programs to reduce its consumption of cash  including operating expense reductions and the financing agreement with ge capital  which enables the company to obtain an upfront cash payment on certain domestic placement agreements 
while the company is encouraged by the recent developments with respect to fda approval and the hcfa announcement that medicare will provide coverage for tmr procedures performed with devices approved by the fda  the historical absence of widespread reimbursement for the tmr procedure by third party payers  principally medicare  medicaid  and private health insurance plans  has limited demand for and use of the heart laser system in the united states 
although medicare reimbursement is expected to begin in and some private insurance plans have begun reimbursing health care providers for tmr procedures using the heart laser system  the company believes that operating losses are likely to continue until such time as third party payers begin to provide widespread reimbursement to healthcare providers for use of the heart laser system 
recognizing the deliberate nature that accompanies a highly regulated process such as the above  management of the company has outlined a plan of appropriate action steps to attempt to ensure that the company has adequate sources of cash to meet its working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
in march  management of the company received approval from the board of directors to implement this action plan 
the key elements of the plan are as follows further operating expense reductions to eliminate certain expenditures which are not critically essential to achieving critical business objectives at this time eg  discretionary spending  further development efforts strategic realignment of the company s international sales organization 
pursuit of strategic alternatives related to the company s domestic sales efforts that can help it further penetrate existing markets 
pursuit of strategic financing alternatives including the sale of debt securities  bank financing  strategic alliances  joint ventures or by other means 
while the company has not yet finalized the specific details of its plan  management is committed to developing restructuring alternatives  which  if implemented  would result in a material charge to operations in as a result of implementing the above actions  management believes that its existing cash resources and cash from operations will meet working capital requirements over the next twelve months and improve operating results 
however  unanticipated decreases in operating revenues  increases in expenses or further delays in the process of third party payers committing to provide reimbursement to healthcare providers  may adversely impact the company s cash position and require further cost reductions 
no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in achieving broad commercial acceptance of the heart laser system or that the company will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis 
during the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of  which resulted in the use of approximately  to support operations 
cash provided by investing activities was approximately  primarily related to the net maturities of approximately  of marketable securities  offset by an investment of  in fixed assets  primarily related to its placement contract activity 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  primarily related to the net proceeds of  obtained through the issuance of convertible debentures and  in proceeds from the sale of the company s common stock  offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations of  during the year ended december   the company incurred a loss of  which resulted in the use of approximately  to support operations 
cash used in investing activities was approximately  primarily related to the net purchase of  of marketable securities and the investment of  in fixed assets  primarily related to its placement contract activity 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  primarily related to the net proceeds of  through the issuance of convertible debentures and  from proceeds of the sale of the company s common stock 
at december   the company had us net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future taxable income which expire at various dates through  and the company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
in addition  various other deferred tax assets have been generated related primarily to intercompany profit  accruals  and research and development tax credits 
because the company believes that  as of december   it is more likely than not  that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  no tax benefit for prior year losses and other deferred items has been provided 
these amounts could provide a benefit to the company in the future in profitable years  subject to the expirations noted 
the company and certain of its officers have been named as defendants in purported class action lawsuits filed between august and november see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
year the year problem is the result of computer programs that use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
on january   computer equipment and programs that have time sensitive software may not be able to distinguish whether means or this could cause a major system failure or could create erroneous results 
the company could be unable to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
the company may also be vulnerable to other companies year issues 
in  the company formed a task force to determine what if any year compliance issues the company faces 
the task force has developed and implemented a year readiness plan that defines compliance and sets critical milestones to identify any deficiencies and correct them 
the task force identified three basic operational areas that have been and will continue to be examined products products the company currently sells  products the company sold previously  and products of the company s most significant suppliers  business systems computer hardware and software used to operate the company s business  including purchasing  manufacturing  sales and finance  and peripherals the company s telephone  e mail  security and shipping systems 
in  the heart laser system was tested and is believed to be year compliant in all material respects 
in addition  the company has purchased and implemented new enterprise resource planning system software that the vendor has represented is year compliant 
this new software system has replaced substantially all of the company s previous financial software systems 
current estimates of the impact of the year problem on the company s operations and financial results do not include costs and time that may be incurred as a result of vendor or customer failures to become year compliant  but no significant costs have been identified to date 
despite investigation and testing by the company and its business partners  the company s products and systems may contain errors or defects associated with year date functions 
the company believes that its new enterprise resource planning software substantially addresses its material year risks  however  the company is continuing to test its secondary systems and investigate third party compliance efforts 
in a worst case scenario  known and unknown errors and defects that could affect the operation of our products or systems could result in delay or loss of revenue  cancellation of customer contracts  increased service and or warranty costs  increased litigation costs  diversion of product development and personnel resources  and damage to our reputation 
furthermore  the company has not developed a year contingency plan to address any failure of our year compliance review to identify and correct significant year risks 
development of contingency plans is in progress and will continue during calendar year such plans could include stockpiling inventory parts and raw materials  accelerating replacement of affected equipment or software  using back up equipment and software  developing temporary manual procedures to compensate for system deficiencies  and identifying alternative year capable suppliers 
the company cannot be sure that such contingency plans will adequately address the year problem 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors our company has a limited operating history and a history of losses plc systems inc was founded in we have incurred operating losses in every year of our existence except we have incurred net losses of  for the year ended december    for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  as of december   we have an accumulated deficit of  we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next fiscal year 
moreover  although our business is not seasonal in nature  our revenues tend to vary significantly from fiscal quarter to fiscal quarter 
our company is dependent on one principal product we develop and market one principal product a patented high powered carbon dioxide laser system known as the heart laser system 
approximately of our revenue in the fiscal year ended december  and in the fiscal year ended december  was derived from the heart laser system 
our company may be unable to raise needed funds as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  a decrease of  from the balance of  we had as of december  the lack of widespread reimbursement for use of the heart laser system by third party payers such as medicare  medicaid and private health insurance plans has limited demand for and use of the heart laser system in the united states 
although medicare reimbursement is expected to begin in and some private insurance plans have begun reimbursing health care providers for tmr procedures using the heart laser system  we believe that operating losses are likely to continue until such time as third party payers begin to provide widespread reimbursement to healthcare providers for use of the heart laser system 
although we announced an million equity financing commitment on march   we have been unable to access that commitment in full see liquidity and capital resources above 
we have developed an action plan to ensure that the company has adequate sources of cash to meet its working capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
see liquidity and capital resources above 
we are currently exploring a number of alternatives to raise additional capital 
we may not be able to raise additional capital upon satisfactory terms and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in order to compete effectively  we need to gain commercial acceptance the heart laser system is designed for use in the treatment of coronary artery disease in a surgical laser procedure we pioneered known as transmyocardial revascularization 
transmyocardial revascularization is commonly referred to in our industry as tmr 
tmr is a new technology that is only recently becoming known 
we may never achieve widespread commercial acceptance 
to be successful  we need to demonstrate to the medical community in general  and to heart surgeons and cardiologists in particular  that tmr procedures and the heart laser system are effective  relatively safe and cost effective  and train heart surgeons to perform tmr procedures using the heart laser system 
to date  we have trained only a limited number of heart surgeons and will need to expand our marketing and training capabilities 
over  patients have been treated with tmr procedures using the heart laser system in the united states and overseas 
as of december   we had shipped over heart laser systems worldwide 
although the heart laser system has received fda approval and the ce mark  and a number of research studies have reported favorably on the heart laser system  we have not yet received widespread commercial acceptance 
if we are unable to maintain regulatory approvals or to achieve widespread commercial acceptance of the heart laser system  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
results of long term clinical studies may adversely affect our business patients have only been treated with the heart laser system since january  and  as a result  there have been few long term follow up studies 
if patients suffer harmful  long term consequences from the heart laser system  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
rapid technological changes in our industry could make the heart laser system obsolete our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and intense competition 
new technologies and products and new industry standards will develop at a rapid pace 
they could make the heart laser system obsolete 
the advent of new devices and procedures and advances in new drugs and genetic engineering are especially threatening 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
material delays in introducing product enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our product and purchase those of our competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and are in a better financial position to exploit marketing and research and development opportunities 
most of our direct competitors are using a different type of laser than ours  including holmium and excimer lasers 
several of the companies that have entered the market are developing less invasive methods of performing tmr procedures 
these new methods may eliminate the need to make an incision in the patient s chest  reducing costs and speeding recovery 
these new methods may erode the potential tmr market 
we must receive and maintain government approval in order to market our product general the heart laser system and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive  rigorous and changing federal and state regulation in the united states and to similar regulatory requirements in other major markets  including the european community and japan 
to date  we have received regulatory approval in the united states and the european community  but not in japan 
without regulatory approval  we cannot market the heart laser system in japan 
even if granted  regulations may significantly restrict the use of the heart laser system 
the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approval is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
united states although we have received fda approval  the fda has restricted the use of the heart laser system and could reverse its approval at any time in august  we became the first company to receive fda approval to market a laser system for tmr procedures 
however  the fda has not allowed us to market the heart laser system to treat patients whose condition is amenable to conventional treatments  such as heart bypass surgery and angioplasty  and could reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser system at any time 
europe although we have received regulatory approval from the european community  the european community could reverse its approval at any time and france has prohibited commercial use of the heart laser system the heart laser system received the ce mark  which is similar to fda approval  from the european community in the ce mark allows us to market the heart laser system in all european community countries 
however the european community could reverse its ruling and prohibit use of the heart laser system at any time  we cannot market the heart laser system in france  and other european community countries could prohibit or restrict use of the heart laser system 
despite receiving the ce mark  the french ministry of health instituted a commercial moratorium on tmr procedures in october in its opinion  the procedure is considered to be experimental and should only be performed within the context of a clinical study 
an evaluation of the safety of the heart laser system is currently under review by a panel of french experts 
we have provided our clinical results to the panel and are actively working to have this moratorium lifted 
there is no assurance when or if we will be successful 
asia we cannot market our product in major asian markets until we receive government approval we believe that japan represents the largest potential market for the heart laser system in asia 
prior to marketing the heart laser system in japan  we must receive approval from the japanese government 
this approval requires a clinical study in japan with at least patients 
this study was completed in we submitted the results of this study to the japanese government in december we do not know whether the clinical study will be sufficient or when  if ever  we will receive approval to sell the heart laser system in japan 
additional regulatory applications are pending in taiwan and south korea 
we cannot be sure when  if at all  we will obtain regulatory approval in any particular country 
asserting and defending intellectual property rights may impact results of operation regardless of success in our industry  competitors often assert intellectual property infringement claims against one another 
the success of our business depends on our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property 
future litigation may have a material impact on our financial condition even if we are successful in marketing the heart laser system 
we may not be successful in defending or asserting our intellectual property rights 
we may be subject to product liability lawsuits  our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages we may be subject to product liability claims 
a recent united states supreme court decision held that compliance with fda regulations will not shield a company from common law negligent design claims or manufacturing and labeling claims based on state rules 
although we have product liability insurance with a yearly aggregate maximum of million  we cannot be sure that our insurance is adequate to cover any product liability law suits 
our insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if a successful product liability claim or series of claims exceeded our insurance coverage  it would divert the attention of our key personnel  degrade the reputation and marketability of our technology and products  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have been sued for alleged violations of securities law in july  an fda advisory panel recommended against approval of our application to market the heart laser system 
following this recommendation  we were named as defendant in purported class action lawsuits filed between august and november in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts 
the lawsuits seek an unspecified amount of damages in connection with alleged violations of the federal securities laws based on our failure to obtain a favorable fda panel recommendation in nineteen of these complaints have been consolidated by the court into a single action for pretrial purposes and two suits have been dismissed 
the company moved to dismiss all of the remaining claims 
on march   the court issued an order dismissing some  but not all of the remaining claims 
we have also been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in massachusetts superior court in september this suit seeks over million in damages for alleged negligent misrepresentations and fraud arising from our failure to obtain a favorable fda recommendation in we cannot make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of these lawsuits  but an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we may not be able to pay the amount of any judgment against us 
we believe that we have valid defenses to these litigation matters and are conducting a vigorous defense 
because we are incorporated in canada  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us and our canadian directors under canadian law  you may not be able to enforce a judgment issued by courts in the united states against us or our canadian directors 
the status of the law in canada is unclear as to whether a us citizen can enforce a judgment from a us court in canada for violations of us securities laws 
a separate suit may need to be brought directly in canada 
antitakeover provisions may prevent you from realizing a premium return provisions of canadian law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to you 
specifically  canadian law requires any person who makes a tender offer that would increase the person s stock ownership to more than of our outstanding common stock to make a tender offer for all of our common stock 
these provisions could prevent you from realizing the premium return that stockholders may realize in conjunction with corporate takeovers 
in addition  our articles provide for three classes of directors  with one third elected each year for a three year term 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a corporate takeover or a change in our management 
this could adversely affect the market price of your common stock 
market price of our stock may fall if other stockholders sell their stock if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a price we deem appropriate 
the value of your common stock may decrease if other security holders exercise their options and warrants or convert their debt into common stock as shown in the table below  we have reserved an additional  shares of common stock for future issuance upon exercise or conversion of outstanding options  redeemable warrants and convertible debt 
range of weighted average shares reserved exercise exercise for future conversion prices conversion price issuance options  redeemable  warrants convertible debt  total  we plan to issue additional options and warrants in the future 
if any of these securities are exercised or converted  you may experience significant dilution in the market value and earnings per share of your common stock 
we have no intention to pay dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain all future earnings  if any  for use in our business and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
the year problem could cause us to experience manufacturing delays the year problem is the result of computer programs that use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
on january   computer equipment and programs that have time sensitive software may not be able to distinguish whether means or this could cause a major system failure or could create erroneous results 
we could be unable to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar business activities 
we may also be vulnerable to other companies year issues 
despite investigation and testing by us and our business partners  our products may contain errors or defects associated with year date functions 
we believe that our new enterprise resource planning software substantially addresses our material year risks  however  we are continuing to test our secondary systems and continuing to investigate third party compliance efforts 
in a worst case scenario  known and unknown errors and defects that affect the operation of our products or software could result in delay or loss of revenue  cancellation of customer contracts  diversion of product development resources  damage to our reputation  and increased service  warranty and litigation costs 
furthermore  we have not developed a year contingency plan to address any failure of our year compliance review to identify and correct significant year risks 
development of contingency plans is in progress and will continue during calendar year such plans could include stockpiling inventory parts and raw materials  accelerating replacement of affected equipment or software  using back up equipment and software  developing temporary manual procedures to compensate for system deficiencies  and identifying alternative year capable suppliers 
we cannot be sure that our contingency plans will adequately address the year problem 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements this annual report and information incorporated by reference contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements deal with our current plans and expectations and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
statements containing terms such as believes does not believe plans expects intends estimates anticipates and other phrases of similar meaning are considered to contain uncertainty and are forward looking statements 
no forward looking statement is a guarantee of future performance 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
we make cautionary statements in certain sections of this annual report  including in the risk factors identified above  and in materials incorporated by reference 
you should read these cautionary statements as being applicable to all related forward looking statements  wherever they appear in this annual report  in the materials referred to in this annual report  in the materials incorporated by reference into this annual report  or in our press releases 
you should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the company s operations consists of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and sells the products 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s operating results are exposed to changes in exchanges rates between the us dollar and swiss franc and the german mark 
when the us dollar strengthens against the franc or mark  the value of nonfunctional currency sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the functional currency amount of sales increases 
overall  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar  but is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
the company s exposures are not significant 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents as well as interest paid on its debt
