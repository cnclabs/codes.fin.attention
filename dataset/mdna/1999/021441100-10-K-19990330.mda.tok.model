item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations altera designs  manufactures and markets high performance  high density  programmable logic devices and associated computer aided engineering logic development tools 
flex and apex products are the company s sram based line of embedded array programmable logic devices  and max products are the company s line of eeprom and eprom based macrocell programmable logic devices 
beginning in the composition of the company s product categories was changed and prior years data reported here have been restated to reflect those changes 
new products now consist of the company s volt or lower families  are manufactured on a micron or finer geometry and are made up of the flex ka ke  flex a  max a b and apex families 
mainstream products now include the max s  max and flex k families 
mature products now consist of the classic  max  max and flex families 
other products include tools  flashlogic  configuration devices  mplds and fsps 
sales sales of million grew over sales of million and over sales of million 
the slowdown in sales growth was largely due to a decline in the overall semiconductor and programmable logic markets 
product transition the company s new and mainstream products have been developed and introduced to the marketplace over the last several years 
these products have similar or improved features and comparable or higher densities than their predecessors  but advanced process technology enables the company to produce these products at a lower cost than previous generations of products 
consistent with their lower cost structure  the company has priced these products at a significant discount to the company s mature products in order to stimulate demand and broaden the appeal of programmable logic 
in the short term  the reduced pricing on new and mainstream products has dampened revenue growth and the company s management expects that in the near term this effect will continue as customers shift demand to its newer  lower priced offerings from the mature products  which in comprised of sales 
management of the company believes that lower prices on its newer product families will enable its product offering to compete more favorably with gate array and standard cell technologies  which represent significant market opportunities 
the company believes that over time  additional unit sales will more than offset the lower selling prices  but there can be no assurances that this will occur 
new product sales in were more than ten times the sales in and reached of total sales in as compared to of total sales in additionally  sales of mainstream products almost doubled year over year to reach of sales in against of sales in new and mainstream products together comprised of sales compared to of sales in in contrast to this  the company s mature and other products  which combined represented of sales in were of sales 
sales growth by product category year ended december  new nm mainstream mature other total customer sectors accompanying this product transition was a sustained shift in customer mix towards the communications market driven primarily by growth in the networking and telecommunications sectors 
communications represented of the company s business in as compared to of the total in the broad based industrial market was of total sales in and in growing year to year 
the electronic data processing  consumer and other markets comprised  and  respectively and all declined as a percent of total sales in geographic areas north american sales increased from and represented of total sales in europe grew  accounting for of sales in sales to japan were up from and represented of the company s sales  end customer purchases from distributors  measured in yen  increased 
asia pacific sales declined and were just of sales  owing to significant turmoil in several of the economies comprising that region 
in spite of a significant decline in asia pacific and overall weakness in the japanese economy  sales to international grew primarily due to strength in the european and japanese telecommunications and networking sectors 
in international sales were of total company sales 
in  north america sales grew and were of total sales 
europe sales grew in and represented of total sales 
japan experienced a growth in sales and accounted for of sales 
asia pacific sales grew in and were of total company sales 
sales growth by geographic area year ended december  north america europe japan asia pacific total international total major items in the statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of sales  were as follows year ended december  cost of sales gross margin research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense interest and other income  net provision for income taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was in  in and in cost reductions  as a result of manufacturing process improvements  have been offset by reduced pricing 
research and development expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were in  in and in absolute r d spending increased by million over spending increases relate to the development of new products including flex ke  max a and apex  as well as development of the company s quartus software 
the relatively higher expenses in were due to prototype and pre production expenses associated with the max s  max  and flex k product families 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million in from million in and decreased slightly as a percentage of sales  falling to in from in the slight increase in terms of dollars spent from to was mainly driven by increased personnel expenses for marketing and administration and higher depreciation expenses associated with capital spending required to support the company s information systems  partially offset by lower legal expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and increased slightly as a percentage of sales  rising to in from in the increase was mainly driven by higher marketing and administrative headcount  higher commissions on increased sales volumes  new and expanded international offices and expenses associated with the replacement of the company s main business information systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions and incentive expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  and legal expenses 
the direct sales force and field application engineers  who work in over twenty field sales offices worldwide  stimulate demand by assisting the customers in the use and proper selection of the company s products 
the customers then work with the company s distributors for order fulfillment and logistical requirements  as over of the company s sales are made through distributors 
the company intends to continue to increase sales resources in markets and regions where it anticipates this will increase sales  enhance competitive position  or improve customer service 
income from operations income from operations was million in  million in and million in as a percentage of sales  income from operations was  and in  and  respectively 
income from operations decreased as a percentage of sales from to primarily due to a slight decrease in gross margin 
the increase in income from operations as a percentage of sales from to was primarily due to improvements in gross margin and to a lesser degree reduced operating expenses selling  general and administrative plus research and development as a percentage of sales 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in from million in and million in interest expense relates to the convertible subordinated notes issued in june and includes interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs  net of capitalized interest related to the construction of the new headquarters 
the decrease in interest expense from to is primarily attributable to the conversion of the company s subordinated notes into common stock in june interest and other income  net interest and other income increased to million in from million in and million in the increase over the three year period resulted from increased cash balances available for investment throughout the year 
provision for income taxes altera s effective tax rate was in compared to in and in the reduction from to was due in part to an increased amount of earned interest income from tax exempt investments and a change in the geographic mix of income 
the reduction in the rate from to was primarily due to an increase in research and development tax credits 
equity investment in june  the company  tsmc and several other partners formed wafertech  llc wafertech  a joint venture company  to build and operate a wafer manufacturing plant in camas  washington 
in return for a million cash investment  the company received an equity ownership in the joint venture company and certain rights and obligations to procure up to of the factory s output at market prices 
in january  the company purchased from analog devices  inc an additional equity ownership interest in wafertech for approximately million  increasing its ownership interest to 
the company accounts for this investment under the equity method based on the company s ability to exercise significant influence on the operating and financial policies of wafertech 
the company s equity in the net loss of wafertech was million for and was not material for and in october production began at the wafertech joint venture 
wafertech is currently in the initial stages of production volumes 
accounting change in october  the company changed its accounting method for recognizing revenue on sales to distributors with an effective date of january  the company previously recognized revenue upon shipment to distributors net of appropriate reserves for sales returns and allowances 
following the accounting change  revenue recognition on shipments to distributors is deferred until the products are resold to end customers 
the company believes that deferral of revenue on distributor sales and related gross margins until the product is shipped by the distributors results in a more meaningful measurement of results of operations and is more consistent with industry practice and  therefore  is a preferable method of accounting 
the cumulative effect prior to of the change in accounting method was a charge of million net of million of income taxes or per diluted share in future results future operating results will depend on the company s ability to develop  manufacture and sell complex semiconductor components and programming software that offer customers greater value than solutions offered by competing vendors 
the company s efforts in this regard may not be successful 
the company plans to sustain future growth by offering programmable chips for applications that are presently served by other asic vendors 
these vendors have well established market positions and a solution that has been proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in displacing asic vendors in the targeted applications and densities 
furthermore  other programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be successful in securing market share to the exclusion of the company 
moreover  standard cell technologies are increasingly used by the company s customers to achieve greater integration in their systems  this may not only impede the company s efforts to penetrate the asic market but may also displace the company s products in the applications that it presently serves 
the company s future growth will depend on its ability to continue to expand the programmable logic market 
the company is highly dependent upon subcontractors to manufacture silicon wafers and perform assembly  test and shipment to end customers 
the company is also dependent on its wafer foundry partners to improve process technologies in a timely manner to enhance the company s product designs and cost structure 
their inability to do so could have a severe negative impact on the company 
the vast majority of the company s products are manufactured and shipped to customers by subcontractors located in asia  principally japan  taiwan  korea  hong kong and malaysia 
several of these countries are experiencing significant economic disruptions including volatile exchange rates  rising unemployment  insolvencies and government fiscal austerity programs 
disruptions or adverse supply conditions arising from market conditions  political strife  labor disruptions and other factors could have adverse consequences on the company s future results 
natural or man made disasters  normal process fluctuations and variances in manufacturing yields could have severe negative impact on the company s operating capabilities 
the company has sought to diversify its operating risk by participating in the wafertech joint venture to manufacture silicon wafers with other partners in camas  washington 
in october production began at the wafertech joint venture 
wafertech is currently in the initial stages of production volumes and has yet to make a profit 
although the company expects future wafertech production volumes and profitability to increase  there is currently an oversupply of semiconductor fabrication capacity 
there can be no assurances that the worldwide supply and demand for semiconductor wafers will be such that wafertech will make a profit and that wafertech will not continue to have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
also  a number of factors outside of the company s control  including general economic conditions and cycles in world markets  exchange rate fluctuations or a lack of growth in the company s end markets could adversely impact future results 
an important component of the company s growth  the networking equipment market  has been growing at a slower rate in recent years 
should this trend continue  the company s growth in future years may be limited 
because of the foregoing and other factors that might affect the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results 
in addition  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and other factors have resulted in a highly volatile price of the company s common stock 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes standards for accounting and reporting on derivative instruments for periods beginning after june  and early adoption is permitted 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires current recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the company expects that its adoption of sfas no 
 which will become effective in fiscal year  will not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during  the company s operating activities generated net cash of million which was primarily attributable to net income of million adjusted by non cash items including depreciation and amortization of million  equity in loss of wafertech of million  a decrease in inventories and other assets of million  and an increase in deferred income on sales to distributors and income taxes payable of million 
these items were offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
investing activities during  the net cash used by the company in its investing activities was million 
the company invested million for manufacturing and data processing equipment and software and the construction of the malaysian design and manufacturing center 
additionally  the company purchased million net of short term investments 
financing activities during  the net cash used by the company in its financing activities was million 
the company repurchased million shares of its common stock for million  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock to employees through various option and employee stock purchase plans 
financial condition the company has historically financed its operations primarily through cash generated from operations 
as of december   the company had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available to finance future growth 
management believes that capital expenditures in will approximate the expenditures in the company believes the available sources of funds and cash expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance current operations and capital expenditures through at least year compliance most computer programs were designed to perform data computations on the last two digits of the numerical value of a year 
when a computation referencing the year is performed  these systems may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
computations referencing the year might be invoked at any time  but are likely to begin occurring in the year pursuant to its year yk compliance program  the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
as used herein  the term computer equipment and software includes systems that are commonly considered information technology it systems eg  accounting  data processing and telephone systems as well as those that are not commonly considered it systems eg  manufacturing equipment  building and facility operations systems 
in addition  the company has also reviewed the software products it sells  and has upgraded and will upgrade such products to offer full yk compliance 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company anticipates that by the end of june  all computer equipment and software that are material to altera s internal business operations and all software products that altera sells will be fully compliant with yk standards  specifically disc pd as published by the british standards institute 
the company has not incurred and does not anticipate that it will incur material expenditures for the remediation of any yk issues 
the company could be adversely impacted by yk issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors and financial service organizations third parties with which the company interacts 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for the company with respect to the yk problem is the failure of a major distributor or supplier to be yk compliant such that the distribution of altera products or the supply of components for such products is interrupted temporarily 
this could result in the company not being able to produce or distribute product for a period of time  which in turn could result in lost sales and profits 
based solely on responses received from these third parties  the company has no reason to believe that there will be any material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations relating to any yk issues of such third parties 
however  if the responses received from these third parties are not accurate or happen to change  then there could be an unforeseen material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management will continue to determine the impact  if any  that third parties who are not yk compliant may have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the company has charged its business resumption planning committee to evaluate yk business disruption scenarios  coordinate the establishment of yk contingency plans  and identify and implement preemptive strategies 
contingency plans for critical business processes will be developed by the end of june employees in  the number of employees increased to  at year end 
in  there were  employees at year end 
impact of currency and inflation the company purchases the majority of its materials and services in us dollars  and its foreign sales are transacted in us dollars 
however  altera does have japanese yen denominated purchase contracts with sharp corporation of japan for processed silicon wafers 
in recent years  the company did not hold or purchase any foreign exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of japanese yen 
during the first half of  the company entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase malaysian ringgit to meet a portion of its firm contractual commitments for the construction of its malaysian design and manufacturing center 
at the end of the company had no open forward contracts 
the company may choose to enter into similar contracts from time to time should conditions appear favorable 
effects of inflation on altera s financial results have not been significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million  respectively 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and  the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
the company has international subsidiary operations and japanese yen denominated wafer purchase contracts with sharp corporation of japan and is  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
to date  the exposure to the company related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
if the foreign currency rates fluctuate by from rates at december  and  the effect on the company s financial position and results of operations would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future
