at november   the company had project backlog of approximately million  substantially all of which it expects to realize within the next twelve months 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s revenues from its industrial  environmental and specialty fabrication segments may be affected by the timing of scheduled outages at its industrial customers facilities and by weather conditions with respect to projects conducted outdoors 
the effects of seasonality may be offset by the timing of large individual contracts  particularly if all or a substantial portion of the contracts fall within a one to two quarter period 
accordingly  the company s quarterly results may fluctuate and the results of one fiscal quarter should not be deemed to be representative of the results of any other quarter or for the full fiscal year 
recognition of revenues the company recognizes revenues and profits on contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  contract revenues are accrued based upon the percentage that accrued costs to date bear to total estimated costs 
as contacts can extend over more than one accounting period  revisions in estimated total costs and profits during the course of work are reflected during the period in which the facts requiring the revisions become know 
losses on contracts are charged to income in the period in which such losses are first determined 
the percentage of completion method of accounting can result in the recognition of either costs and estimated profits in excess of billings or billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts  which are classified as current assets and liabilities  respectively  in the company s balance sheet

forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially 
the company s expectations and beliefs are expressed in good faith and are believed by the company to have a reasonable basis but there can be no assurance that management s expectations  beliefs or projections will be achieved or accomplished 
in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere herein  the following are important factors that  in the view of the company  could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements the ability of the company to continue to expand through acquisitions  the availability of debt or equity capital to fund the company s expansion program and capital requirements  the ability of the company to manage its expansion effectively  the reduction in outsourcing by the industrial groups serviced by the company  the collection and realization of its investments and notes receivable  the economic conditions that could affect demand for the company s services  the ability of the company to complete projects profitably and the severe weather conditions that could delay projects 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have data sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in other routine business activities 
based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
based on presently available information  the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to the failure of these third parties to remediate their own year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s system rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have material adverse effect on the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software for year modifications 
the company plans to complete the year project within one year  but no later than april the total cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows of the company 
of the total project cost  approximately million is attributable to the purchase of new software  which will be capitalized 
the remaining  which will be expensed as incurred over the next two years  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from such plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties
