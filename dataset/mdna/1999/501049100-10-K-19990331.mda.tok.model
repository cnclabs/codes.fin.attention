under this method  kroll o gara accrues estimated contract revenues based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs and recognizes estimated contract losses in full when it becomes likely that a loss will occur 
accordingly  kroll o gara periodically reviews and revises contract revenues and total cost estimates as the work progresses and as change orders are approved

net sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million in to million in security products and services group 
for the year ended december  net sales for the security products and services group increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase includes net sales of commercial products and services  which increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in commercial net sales was primarily due to continued growth in kroll o gara s international armoring divisions 
during   and  kroll o gara initiated start up armoring operations in mexico  brazil and the philippines  and acquired labbe  imea and the assets of protec 
kroll o gara will continue its efforts to expand the operations of its existing foreign subsidiaries along with evaluating new acquisition opportunities and opportunities for entry into new markets 
increases in net sales for security services also contributed to the increase in commercial net sales for the security products and services group 
net sales of these services increased million  or  for the year ended december  in comparison with net sales for the security products and services group include sales of military products and services  which increased million  or  from million in to million in in april  kroll o gara began work on a new contract with the us military to supply up armored hmmwvs to the us army and the us air force the contract 
production on kroll o gara s previous contract with the us military for up armored hmmwvs the contract continued through july the combination of production on the two contracts was a factor in the increase in net sales 
currently  hmmwv production is based only on the contract 
based on certain internal requirements  the us air force has dictated an aggressive delivery schedule for the contract 
this delivery schedule has required kroll o gara to maintain an increased level of production for the up armored hmmwv in comparison with production levels in previous periods 
management expects to maintain the increased level of production and net sales in  with decreases as the contract nears completion at the end of the year 
investigations and intelligence group 
for the year ended december  net sales for the investigations and intelligence group increased million  or  from million in to million in the increases in were primarily due to the inclusion of net sales from the acquisitions of lindquist avey  inphoto  corplex  fact finders  and holder 
excluding net sales reported by these acquired entities  net sales for the investigations and intelligence group would have been million for the year ended december   in comparison with million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in net sales without acquisitions in the investigations and intelligence group was the result of an internal growth plan carried out by the group in during the year  the investigations and intelligence group opened offices in dallas  boston  houston and mexico city 
the internal growth plan will continue in  with the group seeking additional markets for its products  both domestic and foreign 
information security group 
the information security group initiated operations in  recording net sales of million 
management expects the information security group s product offerings to result in significantly higher group sales in voice and data communications group 
for the year ended december  net sales for the voice and data communications group increased million  or  from million in to million in late in the second quarter of  kroll o gara was approached by a third party interested in purchasing the voice and data communications group 
the group s management during the latter part of the second quarter and throughout a majority of the third quarter was focused on negotiations  due diligence requests  and related demands on their time 
the diversion resulted in a decrease in net sales in the third quarter of due to several factors  the potential buyer decided not to complete the transaction  and all discussions were abandoned 
kroll o gara does not expect to incur any material charges associated with these discussions 
cost of sales and gross profit 
for the year ended december  cost of sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in cost of sales was due to the increased level of business activity experienced in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for and  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales experienced in the investigations and intelligence group 
this increase  approximately  was due to a more efficient use of subcontract services and certain high margin engagements booked during the year which are historically infrequent in nature 
the gross profit percents for the security products and services group were and in and  respectively 
in the voice and data communications group  gross margin percent increased from in to in due to a one time reconciliation of cost recognized on air time sold with the satellite communications equipment 
because these engagements are historically infrequent  management does not expect to maintain the level of gross profit as a percent of net sales reflected in the results of the investigations and intelligence group for the year ended december  as always  the gross profit percent will vary on the mix of sales from the four groups 
kroll o gara historically has experienced its highest levels of gross profit as a percent of net sales in the investigations and intelligence group and its lowest in the voice and data communications group 
as revenue from the investigations and intelligence group increases as a percent of total net sales  the gross profit percent should increase as well 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million from million for the same period in included in operating expenses in were approximately million in expenses related to the merger with khi 
in kroll o gara recorded approximately million in merger related expenses associated with the laboratory specialists  schiff  and securify mergers 
before merger related expenses  operating expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the level of personnel and professional services required to administer the growth experienced by kroll o gara in as a percent of net sales  operating expenses  before merger related costs  were in and as a result of investments made by kroll o gara in facilities and personnel in previous periods  kroll o gara did not require additional commitment of fixed cost relative to the level of net sales in as sales increase further  kroll o gara will be required to commit additional amounts of fixed cost to secure increased incremental net sales 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  compared to million in with the completion of kroll o gara s may offering  a significant portion of kroll o gara s indebtedness was paid off approximately million 
as a result  kroll o gara experienced lower interest expense starting in the third quarter of and expects interest expense to be lower in comparison with periods prior to that offering 
on may   kroll o gara entered into an agreement with certain institutional investors to issue and sell million worth of senior notes 
this agreement contained a provision for a reduction of the interest rate if certain criteria were met 
kroll o gara complied with the specified criteria and the step down of rates commenced in the second quarter of the reduction  which changed the interest rate from to  contributed to the decrease in interest expense in interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  compared to million in net proceeds of the may offering that were not used to pay down debt were invested in short term instruments with maturities of three months or less 
the return on these investments was responsible for the increase in interest income in management anticipates that it will continue to have funds available for investment in the foreseeable future 
as a result  kroll o gara anticipates it will continue to experience higher levels of interest income in in comparison with periods prior to the may offering 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  in comparison with million for the same period in the effective tax rates for the periods were in and in in  kroll o gara booked taxes at an effective rate significantly higher than it had previously experienced largely due to the non deductibility of certain merger related expenses incurred in the period 
in  kroll o gara determined that certain of the khi merger expenses qualified for future deductibility which favorably impacted the effective tax rate in in addition  the tax provision also reflects the favorable impact of certain foreign locations with statutory tax rates at levels below us tax rates and the reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
management expects the effective tax rate to be approximately in compared to net sales 
net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the primary reasons for this change were the acquisitions made in kroll o gara s security products and services group and voice and data communications group in security products and services group 
net sales for the security products and services group increased million  or  from million in to in the group s net sales for from commercial products and services were million  an increase of million  or  over this increase was due to several factors  including primarily the incorporation of net sales from labbe and iti in the groups s results 
excluding acquisitions  net sales from commercial products and services increased million  or 
kroll o gara experienced significant growth in its brazilian and mexican armoring subsidiaries  a trend management believes will continue for the forseeable future 
with the purchase of imea and the initiation of a start up armoring operation in the philippines  the security products and services group continued its expansion in existing and new markets 
in  the us military requested accelerated production of up armored hmmwv s 
this resulted in net sales of million in military net sales returned to a non accelerated level in  resulting in net sales from military products decreasing by million  or  to million in investigations and intelligence group 
net sales for the investigations and intelligence group increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in specimens analyzed by laboratory specialists  kroll o gara s drug testing subsidiary 
the increase in specimens analyzed was due to certain asset purchases made in early  along with additional accounts obtained through normal sales and marketing efforts 
most of the revenue reported by the investigations and intelligence group is generated by khi 
throughout  khi was actively involved in various strategic discussions that contemplated the sale of the company 
pending the outcome of such discussions  khi delayed implementation of its internal growth plans 
in addition  uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the discussions resulted in the departure of certain khi managers prior to the khi merger 
finally  in connection with the khi merger and in an effort to improve its cost structure  kroll o gara reduced personnel in certain markets 
as a result  revenue growth at khi was flat in comparison with voice and data communications group 
during  kroll o gara replaced its primary wholesale distributor  acquired next destination  a subdistributor  and reconfigured its distribution product mix to focus on the sale of satellite communications equipment in addition to satellite navigation equipment 
as a result  kroll o gara experienced a higher than normal growth rate in net sales for the voice and data communications group were million in  an increase of million  or  from million in cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in cost of sales was due to increases in kroll o gara s level of business activity as a result of the acquisitions made in security products and services group 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the security products and services group improved from in to in as revenues and costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  actual cost and gross profit may be revised from previously estimated amounts 
historically kroll o gara has experienced a higher gross profit percent related to net sales of commercial armoring products in comparison with those of military armoring products 
in the future  kroll o gara expects to increase its percentage of sales from commercial armoring products 
however  because kroll o gara s gross profit percentage was affected favorably by adjustments resulting from performance on certain contracts in  kroll o gara does not expect to maintain the gross profit percentage level in investigations and intelligence group 
gross profit as a percent of net sales for the investigations and intelligence group increased from in to in gross profit percent in was unfavorably affected by a write off of million in uncollectible accounts receivable relating to services provided in earlier periods 
without the write off  the gross profit percentages would have been comparable between periods 
voice and data communications group 
prior to the acquisition of next destination  kroll o gara s voice and data communications group realized a higher gross profit percentage due to its mix of integrated products versus distributed products 
as a distributor  next destination s gross profit percentages were relatively lower 
as a result  the inclusion of revenue from next destination caused a decrease in gross profit as a percent of net sales for the voice and data communications group from in to in management expects the level of gross profit percentage experienced in to be maintained in future periods 
operating expenses 
excluding expenses of million related to the khi merger  operating expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the million in expenses related to the khi merger consisted of approximately million in professional fees and expenses and approximately million relating to the integration of the operations of the two companies 
included in the integration expenses were bonuses paid to certain key employees as incentives to remain with kroll o gara and severance payments made to employees who left kroll o gara in connection with the merger 
also included was a charge made as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of certain shares of restricted khi stock immediately prior to the merger 
all of the costs related to the khi merger were recognized in and will have no effect on the earnings of kroll o gara in future periods 
the primary reason for the increase in operating expenses  exclusive of expenses related to the khi merger  was the inclusion of operations from the acquisitions made in in addition  the increase in operating expenses reflects kroll o gara s efforts to expand into new markets  both in the security products and service group and the investigations and intelligence group 
excluding expenses related to the khi merger  operating expenses as a percent of net sales stayed essentially consistent between the periods at in and in prior to the khi merger  khi was involved in merger discussions with choicepoint  inc  a subsidiary of equifax  inc 
choicepoint and khi did not reach a final agreement  and as result did not consummate the transaction 
certain professional fees  which totaled approximately million  associated with the choicepoint transaction are included in kroll o gara s operating expenses in interest expense 
interest expense for increased million  or  to million  compared to million in the increase in was the result of increased borrowing to finance kroll o gara s acquisitions 
kroll o gara retired a portion of its debt with proceeds from the may offering 
as a result  interest expense is expected to the lower in than in other  net 
other income expense  net decreased from million of income in to million in expense in the change was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency translation losses recognized in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was increased from million in to million in kroll o gara s o gara hess eisenhardt armoring company ohe subsidiary did not book a tax provision for the first ten months of due to ohe s s corporation status  which was terminated on october  in conjunction with a reorganization in advance of kroll o gara s initial public offering 
kroll o gara incurred taxes at the effective rate of in due to the non deductibility of certain expenses related to the khi merger in the period and the impact of foreign losses for which no benefit can be provided 
management believes that the rate is substantially higher than kroll o gara will experience in and for future periods 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
kroll o gara had previously capitalized costs related to the reengineering of certain information systems 
the capitalized amount  approximately million before tax  was expensed in in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
accounting for costs incurred in connection with a consulting contract that combines business process reengineering and information technology transformation 
the amount expensed is shown net of applicable tax benefit of million 
discontinued operations 
in connection with the acquisition of national psychopharmacology laboratory  inc kroll o gara s laboratory specialists subsidiary attempted to sell the clinical testing and analysis lines of business of national psychopharmacology without success 
in the fourth quarter of  laboratory specialists discontinued these operations resulting in a loss from the discontinued operation of million and a loss on the disposal of million  after giving effect to a tax benefit of million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general 
kroll o gara historically has met its operating cash needs by utilizing borrowings under its credit arrangements and net proceeds from public offerings to supplement cash provided by operations  excluding non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization 
credit facility 
kroll o gara s credit agreement with keybank national association keybank  entered into in may  was amended effective october  the amendment to the credit agreement allows kroll o gara to maintain the same capacity on its revolving credit facility million and its letter of credit facility approximately million  while reducing the applicable interest rates and revising the covenant restrictions 
the interest rate on the revolving credit facility will vary  based on certain financial ratios between prime less to prime less  or  at kroll o gara s option  libor plus to libor plus 
the covenants contained in the original credit agreement were no longer appropriate given kroll o gara s capital structure following the may offering 
the covenants were adjusted to reflect the changes experienced by kroll o gara and the changes anticipated in future periods 
as of march   there were no borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the remaining proceeds from the may offering along with the unused capacity on the revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund the working capital needs of kroll o gara for the foreseeable future 
cash flows from operating activities 
operating activities used million in net cash for the year ended december  in comparison with million in net cash provided by operating activities in since the inception of kroll o gara s contract with the us government to armor the hmmwv through the time of the merger with khi and the acquisitions completed in and the first quarter of  kroll o gara was designated a small business according to us government procurement regulations 
thereafter  the kroll o gara s designation was changed to large business for government procurement purposes 
the change in designation affects progress payments made by the government to kroll o gara over the course of a contract  and kroll o gara s cash flow  in two ways 
first  the progress payments are determined using a smaller percentage of total cost committed than before 
second  kroll o gara is reimbursed for vendor invoices paid instead of expenses incurred 
although these changes will not affect the total amount ultimately collected  they defer certain amounts previously included as part of a progress payment until the vehicles are delivered 
the majority of these adjustments to the way kroll o gara is reimbursed for its military business were applied to the hmmwv contracts in this resulted in a significant increase in the balance of cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and its related effect on cash flows from operating activities 
kroll o gara will continue to absorb the effect of the change in procurement designation throughout the life of the hmmwv contract 
although there will be no effect on cash flows from operating activities on a cumulative basis  the change in payment terms will impact accounts receivable and cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts from period to period 
also  kroll o gara s level of accounts receivable was higher in compared to due to the increased level of business activity experienced in additionally  due to provisions of the purchase agreement  kroll o gara did not record any accounts receivable on the opening balance sheet in connection with the acquisition of lindquist avey 
as of december   lindquist avey had approximately million recorded in accounts receivable  helping to explain the significant amount of cash used by changes in accounts receivable 
cash flows from investing activities 
historically  kroll o gara has limited its capital expenditure requirements by leasing certain assets 
capital expenditures totaled million for the year ended december   and million for the same period in additions to databases totaled million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the levels of capital expenditures and additions to databases are in excess of the amounts permitted by the credit agreement between kroll o gara and keybank  due mainly to kroll o gara s mergers and acquisitions in keybank has provided kroll o gara a waiver from the requirements of these covenants 
in addition to capital expenditures  investing activities included the acquisitions of labbe  imea and iti  which required a total cash outlay of million  net of cash acquired 
in  the acquisitions of lindquist avey  inphoto  holder and fact finders as well as the assets of protec  pathology laboratories  accu path  harrison laboratories and toxworx laboratories required cash of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
management anticipates that  as kroll o gara continues to pursue strategic acquisitions  additional cash outlays will be required 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
cash from financing activities in includes the net proceeds from the may offering approximately million completed in the second quarter 
in addition  laboratory specialists completed a private offering of its stock in june with proceeds of approximately million 
a portion of the proceeds from these transactions was used to pay off certain indebtedness of the company approximately million 
the amounts not used to pay off debt were invested in short term instruments and are being used as necessary for acquisitions  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
cash flows from financing activities also include convertible preferred stock issued by securify in which was converted to kroll o gara common stock in kroll o gara s acquisition of securify 
the net proceeds to securify associated with these shares were approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities in largely reflects borrowing under the senior notes that was used to finance certain acquisitions and working capital requirements 
foreign operations 
kroll o gara attempts to mitigate the risks of doing business in foreign countries by separately incorporating its operations in such countries  maintaining reserves for credit losses  maintaining insurance on equipment to protect against losses related to political risks and terrorism  and using financial instruments to hedge kroll o gara s risk from translation gains and losses 
kroll o gara utilizes derivative financial instruments  in the form of forward contracts  to hedge some of its exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
at december  eight such contracts  maturing between january and december  were outstanding in connection with intercompany demand notes with labbe and lindquist avey 
these contracts are intended to hedge kroll o gara s exposure to deterioration in the amount outstanding due to changes in currency translation rates 
the notional amount together with amortized premium and the fair market value associated with these forward contracts were million and million  respectively 
gains or losses on existing forward instruments are offset against the translation effects reflected in shareholders equity 
the fair value of forward contracts is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements since they are accounted for as hedges 
kroll o gara does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
year issues 
kroll o gara has initiated a program to prepare for the year during  kroll o gara began the process of replacing the enterprise systems at its two largest subsidiaries  both for the purpose of making the systems year compliant and to enhance the information systems capabilities of these subsidiaries 
the new systems are scheduled to be operational by the end of the third quarter of additionally  kroll o gara is implementing a plan to prepare its remaining systems for year kroll o gara has completed an inventory of all its computer software and embedded technology and has prepared a master database of all technology potentially impacted by the year issue 
in conjunction with outside consultants  kroll o gara now is in the process of evaluating the findings from its inventory and formulating plans of action 
kroll o gara anticipates that it will have taken all the necessary steps to ensure no interruption of services as result of the year issue by the third quarter of total year compliance cost is estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million relates to the new enterprise systems and will be capitalized 
the remaining approximately million will be charged to expense over several reporting periods in accordance with established accounting pronouncements  and is not expected to be material to kroll o gara s results of operations or cash flows 
if systems are not in place or if all appropriate actions have not been taken  kroll o gara s ability to administer and report revenue will be greatly compromised 
both of kroll o gara s largest revenue groups are  for the most part  manual operations 
the manufacture of bullet resistant vehicles and the investigation and intelligence services provided by kroll o gara are not largely dependent on embedded technology 
barring a catastrophic collapse from third party sources  such as a lack of electrical power  kroll o gara should be able to maintain production in its main revenue producing groups  although at a reduced level 
kroll o gara s voice and data communications group relies on third party compliance with the year issue to ensure kroll o gara can continue to operate in this area 
the satellite and global positioning equipment marketed by the voice and data communications group is exclusively dependent on the compliance of the manufacturers of the equipment and the agencies that maintain the satellites for its revenue 
limited services in kroll o gara s investigations and intelligence group  including certain intelligence gathering services  rely solely on third party sources  such as lexis nexis  for their continued operation 
lack of compliance by third parties would significantly impact kroll o gara in these areas 
quarterly fluctuations 
kroll o gara s operations may fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of the timing of contract costs and revenues of its security products and services group  particularly from its military and governmental contracts which are generally awarded in a periodic and or sporadic basis 
kroll o gara generally does not have long term contracts with its clients in its investigations and intelligence group and its ability to generate net sales is dependant upon obtaining many new projects each year  most of which are of a relatively short duration 
period to period comparisons within a given year or between years may not be meaningful or indicative of operating results over a full fiscal year

forward looking statements can be identified by the use of language such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue or other similar words 
kroll o gara s results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on management s current views and assumptions  and involve risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results
