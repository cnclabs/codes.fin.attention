the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal is primarily due to the lico acquisition which formed the solutions automotive segment and generally produces lower gross profit margins than the other segments 
the lower profitability of this segment is offset by a lower operating capital base required to design and manufacture its products 
after isolating the effect of the lico acquisition  the gross profit margin increased by approximately basis points 
the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal resulted primarily from a change in the classification of approximately million of costs into cost of products sold which previously had been classified as general and administrative expenses 
this change was made for intracorporate consistency and had a minimal effect on income from operations 
in addition  the fiscal gross profit margin was also impact by the addition of gl  which also generates lower gross profit margins on a lower capital base as compared to the pre existing products segment businesses 
after isolating the effect of the classification change and the gl merger  the gross profit margin increased by approximately basis points compared to excluding the effects of those specific items noted above  the resulting increase in gross profit margin in each of the periods resulted from the effects of the company s cost control efforts and integration of acquisitions

the percentages reflect the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization resulting from the business acquisitions

inflation and other market conditions the company s costs are affected by inflation in the us economy  and to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  and the pacific rim 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on results of operations over the periods presented because of low inflation levels over the periods and because the company has generally been able to pass on rising costs through price increases 
however  in the future there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation or that it will be able to pass on cost increases 
seasonality and quarterly results lower than average orders and shipments during the december holiday period have a slight effect on the company 
in addition  quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  by periods of high vacation concentrations  and by acquisitions and the magnitude of acquisition costs 
therefore  the operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
year conversions the company s corporate wide year initiative is being managed by a team of internal staff and administered by the director of information services 
the company has completed the assessment phase of its year compliance project and is currently working on remediation of affected components 
the company has determined that it needs to modify certain portions of its corporate business information software so that its computer system will function properly with respect to dates in the year and beyond 
both internal and external resources have been dedicated to identifying  implementing  and testing corrective action in order to make such programs year compliant  all such work is planned to be completed by july and is currently on schedule 
to date the corporate business information software has been assessed  approximately has been remedially reprogrammed  and approximately is now certified to be year compliant 
the company believes that  with modifications to existing software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
the company has completed a corporate wide assessment of the year readiness of microprocessor controlled equipment such as robotics  cnc machines  and security and environmental systems 
this assessment has revealed that at least of all microprocessor controlled equipment  including over of all security and environmental systems  is currently compliant 
any necessary upgrades to ensure year readiness are expected to be in place by the end of june in addition  the company has determined that all of its manufactured products are year compliant 
the company has initiated communications with its suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which systems  products or services are vulnerable to failure should those third parties fail to remediate their own year issues 
to date the company has received responses to over of its inquiries and no year compliance problem has been identified from these responses 
while we believe that our year compliance plan adequately addresses potential year concerns and to date no significant year issues have been identified with our suppliers and customers  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which our operations rely will be compliant on a timely basis and will not have an effect on our operations 
the company has conducted preliminary contingency planning and identified the critical need areas 
a high level approach incorporating manual workarounds  increasing critical inventories  identifying alternate suppliers  and adjusting staffing levels has been discussed and forms the basis for the initial contingency planning 
the company believes this level of planning is appropriate at the current time  however  the planning will be further expanded if warranted by future events 
the cost of the year initiatives is not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial position 
the forward looking statements contained in the year conversions should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of effects of new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

it requires that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the intended use of the derivative and its designation as either a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment a fair value hedge a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction a cash flow hedge  or a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation a foreign currency hedge  will determine when the gains and losses on the derivatives are reported in earnings and when they are to be reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the impact of compliance with this statement has not yet been determined by the company 
in march of  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company adopted the provisions of the sop in its financial statements for the year ended march  the sop requires the capitalization of certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use 
the impact of the sop was not material to the company 
in april of  the aicpa issued sop  reporting the costs of start up activities  which requires costs related to start up activities be expensed as incurred 
the company adopted the provisions of the sop in its financial statements for the year ended march  the adoption of sop had no effect on the company s reported earnings 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
the company is exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates  and primarily changes in interest rates 
the company has entered into financial instrument transactions which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates 
the company does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
the company controls this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of its products 
the company does not enter into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
approximately of the company s operations consist of manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  canada  germany  denmark  the united kingdom  mexico  france and china and sells its products and solutions in over countries annually 
the company s results of operations could be affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the company s operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies  the mexican peso and the chinese renminbi 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the value of sales and net income denominated in canadian dollars decreases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in the company s consolidated results 
the company also is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of foreign operations sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency 
in addition  the majority of export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  the company currently does not invest in derivative instruments such as foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions 
the company controls risk related to changes in interest rates through structuring its debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions 
at march   approximately of the company s outstanding debt has fixed interest rates 
at that date  the company has approximately million of variable rate non current debt and has an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million maturing in july based on libor at  plus the applicable margin based on the company s leverage ratio 
under this agreement  the company makes or receives payments equal to the difference between fixed and variable interest rate payments on the notional amount 
in addition  the company also has a libor based interest rate cap on million of debt  maturing in december at 
a fluctuation in interest rates would change future interest expense on the million of debt that is not covered by the swap agreement by approximately million
