item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
we are primarily engaged in the acquisition of used  single aisle jet aircraft for lease and sale to domestic and foreign airlines and other customers 
we lease aircraft under short term to medium term operating leases where the lessee is responsible for all operating costs and we retain the potential benefit or risk of the residual value of the aircraft 
this is distinct from finance leases where the full cost of the aircraft is generally recovered over the term of the lease 
rental amounts are accrued evenly over the lease term and are recognized as revenue from the rental of flight equipment 
our flight equipment is recorded on the balance sheet at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life to our estimated salvage value 
revenue  depreciation expense and resultant profit for operating leases are recorded evenly over the life of the lease 
initial direct costs related to the origination of leases are capitalized and amortized over the lease terms 
accounting change effective january   we changed our method of accounting for income recognition for ancillary payments under lease agreements to a full accrual method from recognition upon lease termination 
this new method  which was accounted for as a change in accounting method  was made to better reflect the earnings process under lease agreements 
the effect of this change on net earnings  before cumulative effect of accounting change  for the year ended december   was an increase of the cumulative effect on retained earnings at january  of the accounting change was an increase of approximately  net of related income taxes of results of operations years ended december   and revenues from rental of flight equipment increased by to  in from  in primarily a result of the acquisition in of three aircraft under lease and the re lease of flight equipment at a higher lease rate 
our lease portfolio increased from seven aircraft with a book value of  at december  to ten aircraft with a book value of  at december  the increase in rental revenues in to  from  in was primarily the result of the acquisition of three aircraft under lease in  as well as the change in accounting method discussed above 
our lease portfolio increased from ten aircraft with a book value of  at december  to thirteen aircraft with a book value of  at december  during  we purchased a md on lease until march  a boeing model on lease to october and an airbus a on lease to october in  consulting revenues totaled  including paid by great lakes holdings which is owned by our chief executive officer and our president  paid by ilfc and paid by unrelated third parties 
in  consulting revenues totaled  including from great lakes  from ilfc and from unrelated parties 
the decrease in consulting fees of in was partly the result of the termination in january of an arrangement with great lakes 
no further consulting fees are expected to be received from great lakes 
in  consulting fee revenues totaled  paid from unrelated parties 
in  we realized a gain on sale of aircraft equipment of for the sale of an auxiliary power unit previously on lease 
we did not sell aircraft equipment in or the increase in interest income of to in was primarily due to interest on cash  primarily from our initial public offering in november and on increased restricted cash balances 
interest income increased to  in from in principally as a result of a full year of interest earned on increased cash from our initial public offering and on increased restricted cash balances 
expenses as a percent of total revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage from to was primarily the result of the net effect of a increase in total revenues in and a increase in total expenses 
the decrease in the percent of total revenues from to was due to the effect of an increase in total revenues and only a increase in total expenses 
interest expense increased from  in to  in and  in the increase from to was principally the result of additional financing to acquire three aircraft in  offset by loan paydowns and lower interest rates on new financings 
interest expense increased in as a result of interest on financing related to the acquisition of three additional aircraft  offset by loan paydowns and lower interest rates on new financings 
our weighted average interest rate was and at december  and  respectively 
depreciation expense increased from  in to  in and  in the increase from to principally resulted from the acquisition of three aircraft in the increase in from resulted from the acquisition of three additional aircraft in general and administrative expenses were  and  in  and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily the result of the addition of two employees 
the increase from to was primarily the result of additional compensation expense as the result of new employment agreements with our chief executive officer and with our president  as well as the additional costs associated with maintaining our status as a public company 
in and  we incurred of non cash compensation expense related to the vesting of options 
we expect to incur of non cash compensation expense related to the vesting of these options in both and see note to consolidated financial statements 
we recognized income tax expense of  and  representing effective income tax rates of  and  during  and  respectively 
the increase in income tax expense in represents a non cash provision for deferred income taxes at an effective rate of 
we paid no federal income taxes in or due to substantial operating loss carryforwards primarily resulting from accelerated tax depreciation 
the  increase in income tax expense in primarily represents a non cash provision for deferred income taxes 
our effective tax rate decreased to as a result of an increasing number of foreign aircraft in our portfolio and tax planning associated with our federal net operating loss carryforwards 
during  we continued to generate substantial federal net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had  of federal net operating loss carryforwards 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
net income decreased from  in to in and increased to  in due to the factors described above  as well as the cumulative effect of accounting change in liquidity and capital resources our principal external sources of funds have been term loans from banks and seller financing secured by aircraft 
as a result  a substantial amount of our cash flow from the rental of flight equipment is applied to principal and interest payments on secured debt 
the terms of our loans generally require a substantial balloon payment at the end of the noncancellable portion of the lease of the related aircraft  at which time we will be required to re lease the aircraft and renegotiate the balloon amount of the loan or obtain other financing 
refinancing of the balloon amount is dependent upon the re leasing the related aircraft 
accordingly  we begin lease remarketing efforts well in advance of the lease termination 
see item business financing source of funds 
the principal use of cash is for financing the acquisition of our aircraft portfolio  which are financed by loans secured by the applicable aircraft 
we do not currently maintain a line of credit 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities increased from  in to  in and to  in the increase in was principally the result of the acquisition of three aircraft and their related leases 
the increase in was primarily the result of the acquisition of three additional aircraft and their related leases 
in  of net cash was provided by investing activities as a result of the sale of aircraft equipment for  offset by flight equipment purchases of in  the  of net cash used in investing activities was primarily used to purchase three aircraft 
in  cash of  was used in investing activities to purchase three additional aircraft 
in  net cash used in financing activities was  consisting of repayments of notes and other payables of  offset by the proceeds of additional borrowings of in  net cash provided by financing activities was  including the proceeds of borrowings of  primarily to finance the acquisition of three aircraft  offset by repayments of notes of  as well as  from both the issuance of  shares in our initial public offering and the issuance of  shares upon the exercise of stock options 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was  including proceeds from borrowings of  to finance the purchase of three aircraft  offset by repayments of  and  of common stock repurchases 
cash and cash equivalents vary from year to year principally as a result of the timing of the purchase and sale of aircraft 
we use interest rate swap arrangements to reduce the potential impact of increases in interest rates on floating rate long term debt and does not use swap arrangements for trading purposes 
premiums paid for purchased interest rate swap agreements are amortized to interest expense over the terms of the swap agreements 
our ability to execute our business strategy successfully and to sustain our operations is dependent  in part  on our ability to obtain financing and to raise equity capital 
we cannot assure you that the necessary amount of capital will continue to be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to continue to obtain any portion of required financing on favorable terms  our ability to add new aircraft to our lease portfolio  renew leases  re lease an aircraft  repair or recondition an aircraft if required  or retain ownership of an aircraft on which financing has expired would be impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our financing arrangements to date have been dependent in part upon ilfc 
see item business cautionary statements 
impact of year issue the year issue results from computer programs written using two digits to identify the year in the date field 
these computer programs were designed and developed without consideration of the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  these programs could create erroneous information by or at the year we have performed a review and assessment of our internal computer systems to determine the effect of the year issue 
based on the results of this review  we believe that the internal effects of the year issue will not materially affect our future financial results or financial condition 
failure by our lessees  manufacturers of our aircraft and business partners to properly comply with year issues could result in lost revenues and increased expenses 
we have initiated formal communications with lessees  manufacturers of our aircraft and business partners to determine the extent to which we and our aircraft are vulnerable to those third parties failure to address their own year issues 
based on the responses from third parties we have received  we do not expect a material affect on our financial results or our financial position 
as such  no contingency plan has been developed 
if future responses indicate a material exposure as a result of third parties  we will develop a contingency plan 
we expect to be year compliant by december  we have incurred no additional costs associated with the year issue and estimate that no additional costs will be incurred 
we will continue assessing our internal and external risk as we acquire additional information systems and enter into business relationships with additional lessees  manufacturers of aircraft and other business partners 
a possible scenario is that one or more of our lessees would be unable to operate and generate revenues and as a result be unable to make lease payments 
at this time  we are unable to estimate the likelihood or the magnitude of the resulting lost revenue 
market sensitive instruments and risk management this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings  cash flows or fair value of the financial instruments which we held at december  and are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or non quantifiable 
these risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not included in the following analysis 
see item business cautionary statements 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate swaps with financial institutions under terms that provide payment of interest on the notional amount of the swap 
in accordance with these arrangements  we pay interest at a fixed rate and the financial institution pays interest at variable rates pursuant to terms of the loans 
we had no swap agreements at december  the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair market value because of the short term nature of these items 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for our cash equivalents and was not materially different from the year end carrying value 
the fair values of the our debt instruments  including the related avgs  approximate the carrying values because the rates currently offered to us are similar to the rates for these items  or the yields to maturity approximate the rates for these items 
market risk associated with our debt instruments primarily results from our ability to refinance balloon payments at comparable or lower interest rates 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in interest expense in resulting from a hypothetical increase in our weighted average borrowing rate at december  or
