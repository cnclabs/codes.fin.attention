foreign consumer revenues increased in mexico by  and in canada by  reflecting continuing success in their respective mass retail markets 
the decrease in industrial revenue was primarily due to the sale of the us graphite and lubricants division and  to a lesser degree  weakness in the industries served by the refractories division 
while the company has operations in canada  mexico and the uk  historically only the operating results in mexico have been materially impacted by currency fluctuations 
there has been a significant devaluation of the mexican peso at least once in each of the last three decades  the last one being in august of in the short term after such devaluations  consumer confidence has been shaken  leading to an immediate reduction in revenues in the months following the devaluation 
then  after the immediate shock  and as the peso stabilizes  revenues tend to grow 
selling prices tend to rise over the long term to offset any inflationary increases in costs 
the peso  as well as any currency value  depends on many factors including international trade  investor confidence and government policy  to name a few 
these factors are impossible for the company to predict  and thus  an estimate of potential effect on results of operations for the future cannot be made

the company s investing activities included approximately  in purchases of property and equipment before net disposals of  as compared with  in the prior year

generally  all major capital projects are discretionary in nature and thus no material purchase commitments exist 
capital expenditures will continue to be funded from operations and existing financing or new leasing arrangements

year readiness disclosure the year issue relates to the way computer systems and programs define calendar dates  they could fail or make miscalculations while interpreting a date including to mean  not also  many systems and equipment that are not typically thought of as computer related referred to as non it may contain embedded hardware or software that may have a time element dependency 
dixon began work on the year yk compliance issue in the scope of the project includes addressing the compliance of all applications  operating systems  and hardware on mid range  pc and local area network platforms  addressing issues related to non it embedded hardware and software  and addressing the compliance of business partners 
the project has five phases assessment of systems and equipment affected by the yk issue  definition of strategies to address affected systems and equipment  remediation of systems  testing of systems  and certification of systems 
to certify that all it systems are yk compliant  each system will be tested using a standard testing methodology which includes millennium testing  millennium leap year testing and cross over year testing 
testing will be performed on each system as remediation is completed 
dixon has completed all phases for its us and canadian operations 
its mexican operations have been brought into compliance by a complete system replacement 
dixon s non it related systems and equipment are currently yk compliant 
this statement is based primarily upon communication with the vendors as well as physical inspection  assessment  remediation and testing of equipment and related controlling software 
with respect to key business suppliers  the assessment and strategy phases are underway with approximately of all vendors and approaching of critical vendors certifying compliance 
in addition  any non responding critical suppliers have been identified and additional steps are underway to insure that there will be no interruption of services before  during and after january  contingency planning and testing will continue for the rest of we are also dependent upon our customers for sales and cash flow 
yk interruptions in our customers operations could result in reduced sales  increase inventory or receivable levels and cash flow reductions 
while these events are possible  our customer base is broad enough to minimize the effects of a single occurrence 
we are taking steps to monitor the status of our customers as a means of determining risks and alternatives 
dixon utilizes an ibm as system along with j 
d 
edwards software for its core business applications 
these systems have been assessed  upgraded  corrected where necessary and tested to insure continuous and accurate processing of information 
since the inception of the project  the company has incurred approximately  in costs directly related to yk compliance 
these costs were outside the normal and previously planned upgrades of systems 
based on assessments of equipment and systems  the company expects additional yk expense to be less than  which will not have a material affect on the company s operations or financial condition 
in addition  there will not be adverse impact due to postponement of it projects because of resource constraints caused by the yk project 
the company presently believes that its business critical computer systems as well as non it related systems and equipment are yk compliant 
based on the progress the company has made in addressing its yk issues and the company s efforts to complete its contingency planning  the company does not foresee significant risks associated with yk compliance at this time 
forward looking statements any forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k including without limitation  management s expectation with respect to the company s ability to meet its current and anticipated obligations  the company s expectation as to the effect of new accounting pronouncements on its financial position or results of operations  and its readiness with respect to yk  among others involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks include but are not limited to certain foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate fluctuation risk and yk compliance risks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed elsewhere  the company is exposed to the following principal market risks ie risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates foreign exchange rates and interest rates on debt 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk in its international operations is principally limited to mexico and  to a lesser degree  canada 
approximately of the company s fiscal net revenues were derived in mexico and canada  combined exclusive of intercompany activities 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the business unit s functional local currency 
it is estimated that a change in both the mexican peso and canadian dollar would impact reported operating profit by  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because it does not take into account the changes in customer purchasing patterns or any adjustment to the company s financing or operating strategies in response to such a change in rates 
moreover  this measure does not take into account the possibility that these currency rates can move in opposite directions  such that gains from one may offset losses from another 
in addition  the company s cash flows and earnings are subject to changes in interest rates 
as of september   approximately of total short and long term debt is fixed  at rates between and 
the balance of the company debt is variable  principally based upon the prevailing us bank prime rate or libor rate 
certain interest rate swaps  which expire in  fix the rate of interest on million of this debt at approximately 
a change in the average prevailing interest rates of the remaining debt of would not have a material effect upon the company s results of operations or cash flows 
this quantitative measure does not take into account the possibility that the prevailing rates us bank prime and libor can move in opposite directions and that the company has  in most cases  the option to elect either as the determining interest rate factor
