as a result of this decision  the company reviewed the carrying value of the goodwill using the estimated future cash flow method and determined that the goodwill was impaired

this foreign exchange effect cannot be precisely isolated since many other factors affect the company s foreign sales and earnings 
these factors include product offerings and pricing policies of the company and its competition  whether competition is foreign or us based  changes in technology and local and worldwide economic conditions 
the company utilizes hedging techniques designed to mitigate the short term effect of exchange rate fluctuations on operations and balance sheet positions by entering into forward and option currency contracts and by borrowing in foreign currencies 
the company s foreign borrowings are used as a hedge of its net investments and for specified transactions 
the company does not speculate in foreign currencies or derivative financial instruments  and hedging techniques do not increase the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations

additionally  order levels and backlog for fiscal s fourth quarter were at record levels 
although there continues to be good activity  order levels for the first quarter of fiscal will be dependent on continued investment from the company s customers in the semiconductor  telecommunications and other key electronics industries 
however  due to the record backlog level  management does believe that sales and earnings before taxes for the first quarter of fiscal will be similar to or slightly better than those of the fourth quarter 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  however  management expects the company s effective tax rate will approximate the statutory rate in fiscal factors that may affect future results information included in the letter to shareholders and in the outlook section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to expectations as to financial performance  revenues  earnings  expenses  the tax rate  annual sales growth  pretax return on sales and return on equity constitute forward looking statements  as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
some of the factors that may affect future results are discussed below 
although the company operates in a single industry segment  certain of its products and product lines are sold into the semiconductor industry 
growth in demand for semiconductors  new technology and pricing drive the demand for new semiconductor capital equipment 
historically  sales and order levels for this business have been volatile which can affect revenue and earnings for the company 
the company s business relies on the development of new high technology products and services to provide solutions to customer s complex measurement needs 
this requires anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging technology trends 
the company must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether its expectations will eventually result in products that achieve market acceptance 
the company incurs significant expenses developing new products that may or may not result in significant sources of revenue and earnings in the future 
in many cases the company s products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers 
if any of the company s competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for the company s product offerings could slow 
the company s cost structure is comprised of costs that are directly related to the level of sales  as well as costs that are fixed and do not fluctuate based on quarterly sales levels 
the company s ability to maintain its cost structure or to further improve its cost structure depends on its ability to control those costs that are fixed or semi variable 
the company pays taxes in several jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company utilizes available tax credits and other tax planning strategies in an effort to minimize the company s overall tax liability 
the company s actual tax rate for fiscal could change from what is currently anticipated due to changes in various country s tax laws or changes in the company s overall tax planning strategy 
the company currently has ten subsidiaries or sales offices located outside the united states  and non us sales made up half of the company s revenue in fiscal the company s future results could be adversely affected by several factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters 
the company recognizes the need to ensure that year hardware and software issues will not adversely impact its operations 
with regard to the company s own information systems  a substantial portion of year information technology compliance has been achieved in connection with the company s ongoing program to upgrade its key information and operational systems 
the company completed the replacement of one remaining key system that was not year compliant on october  these costs and any anticipated related costs will not have a material impact on the results of operations  financial condition or cash flows of future periods 
with regard to the company s own products  all products currently being sold have been evaluated for year compliance 
most have been found to be ready for the year change 
any exceptions have been identified and alternative solutions for continuing use of these products have been noted 
the cost of identifying and modifying products for year compliance did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial condition or cash flows of future periods and any future costs are not expected to have a material impact 
lastly  the company has surveyed its base of key suppliers to determine if their systems insofar as they relate to the company s business comply with year requirements 
the company is now monitoring their performance to process orders and deliver products as the year approaches 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies with which keithley instruments  inc does business will be able to adequately address the year issue 
if it is determined that any third party may not be ready  the company will develop a contingency plan 
while management does not expect that the failure of any third party to be fully compliant by january  would significantly affect results of operations  financial condition or cash flows of future periods  there can be no assurance that any such failure will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
the company has modified its systems to accommodate the euro 
the cost of these modifications was immaterial to the company s results of operations 
although difficult to predict  any competitive implications and any impact on existing financial instruments are expected to be immaterial to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows of future periods
