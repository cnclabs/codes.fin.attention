adherence to these standards has created a climate of acceptance among both publishers and device users

year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the year

the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the company s actual financial performance 
product concentration revenues from the sale of cd rom and dvd rom products and services constituted substantially all of the company s revenues for  and such products and services are expected to continue to account for substantially all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
a decline in the demand for cd rom and dvd rom products and services  whether as a result of competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
included in the company s cd rom products and services are audio cds for the radio syndication programming services market 
the company does not anticipate revenue growth in its radio syndication services because of the maturity of the market  the company s existing market share  and increased price competition 
competition the company faces competition in the information distribution industry from a number of sources  such as traditional print publishers  on line distributors of information  cd rom manufacturers  and others 
the company s competitors vary by market segment and include many companies which are larger  more established  and have substantially more resources than the company 
the company does not benefit from patents or proprietary technology  and competition may increase in the future 
pricing the cd rom and audio cd industries have been characterized by new manufacturers continually entering the market and by declining prices for cds 
cd rom prices declined industry wide in recent years  and this trend may continue in the future 
to date  continuing market growth has offset increased manufacturing capacity in the cd rom industry 
however  the addition of manufacturing capacity to the industry has continued  and there can be no assurance that market growth will continue at the same rate or that prices paid to cd rom manufacturers will not continue to decline 
in addition  the company s pricing of its new products and services may not in all cases be competitive with the other providers in the marketplace  and some new products and services may not be profitable 
technological change the market for information distribution services incorporating optical disc technology is based upon a sophisticated technology and is subject to rapid technological change 
current or new competitors may introduce new products  features or services that could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
additionally  there can be no assurance that over time optical disc technology will not be replaced by another form of information storage and retrieval technology  such as on line information services 
to date  the company has developed product and service enhancements to address customer requirements and to respond to competitive conditions 
however  the company must continue to improve its products and related services and develop and successfully market new products and services in order to remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
dependence on key personnel the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of certain key personnel  particularly jeffrey m

the loss of mr 
wilkins services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company

the company is currently reviewing alternative financing which would convert a portion of such debt to a fixed rate debt instrument 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
