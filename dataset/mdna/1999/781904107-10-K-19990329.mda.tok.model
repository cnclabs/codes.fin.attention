in the third quarter of  pcs service was launched in sioux falls  south dakota followed by grand forks  north dakota in the fourth quarter of wireless alliance s service area covers  pops 
in all of these markets  aerial contributed the licenses  and rcc is responsible for the building and managing of the networks and marketing of the pcs services 
like aerial s other pcs systems  wireless alliance utilizes industry standard global system for mobile gsm technology 
of the million total investment  as of december   the company has contributed million towards its percent ownership while apt has contributed million in pcs licenses 
in addition  the company has contributed million in excess of its percent ownership  which is reflected as a note receivable from wireless alliance eliminated in consolidation 
general the company s principal operating objective is to increase revenues and achieve profitability through the acquisition and development of new cellular and digital markets and increased penetration in existing markets 
its total market encompasses million pops 
the company has continued to penetrate its existing midwest markets through innovative sales initiatives 
however  the development of the wireless alliance pcs network and the customers added through the acquisition of mrcc and atlantic were the primary factors in the company s increased revenues in fiscal total customers increased to  in as compared to  in offsetting the increase in customers was a decrease in the average monthly cellular revenue per customer from in to in the company believes that this decrease reflects an industry wide trend of adding lower usage customers  who use cellular service for personal convenience  security or as an alternative communication resource to their traditional landline telephone service 
the company intends to pursue acquisitions to the extent they enhance or extend its network or increase shareholder value  although there can be no assurance any such acquisition will be consummated 
the company emphasizes customer support in an effort to maximize its customer retention 
for the year ended december   the company experienced an average monthly cellular retention rate of  as compared to an industry average monthly retention rate of  as reported in the ctia data survey dated june  customer retention continues to be a challenge as the company s customer base grows and competition increases 
however  the company believes that it will continue to maintain relatively high retention rates due in part to its territory manager distribution philosophy  by offering communication service packages and value added features anticipating customer needs  and by providing high quality and knowledgeable customer service 
the company s revenues consist of charges to customers for cellular and paging service  roamer revenues and equipment sales 
service revenues include monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of the time included in the service package purchased  long distance charges derived from calls placed by the company s customers and cellular and paging equipment lease revenues 
in addition  other charges include activation and feature charges for such features as voice mail  call waiting  and call forwarding 
roamer revenues consist of airtime  long distance and service fees charged for providing service to customers of other cellular systems that place or receive a call within the company s cellular service area 
the per minute rate paid by a roamer  or the intercarrier exchange rate  is determined by an agreement between the company and the roamer s cellular carrier 
the company has reciprocal agreements with cellular licensees in adjacent cellular service areas that allow the company to provide service to its customers calling from or receiving calls in these territories at favorable rates 
the company believes that roamer revenues will continue to increase as a result of an increase in both the number of roaming customers and roaming minutes of use as the cellular industry matures 
the company believes these increases will more than offset an expected decline in intercarrier exchange rates 
equipment sales consist of cellular and paging equipment and accessory sales to customers 
within certain markets  the company rents equipment to customers in order to reduce the customers perception that the cost of purchasing cellular service is prohibitive 
this program may negatively affect equipment sales  however  its effect is lessened by other equipment sales programs initiated in newly acquired markets

in the ordinary course of business  the company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities and other potential business transactions 
such acquisitions  joint ventures and business transactions may be material 
such transactions may also require the company to seek additional sources of funding through the issuance of additional debt and or additional equity 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to the company on acceptable or favorable terms 
other matters inflation the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant 
year readiness general issues regarding year readiness exist because many computer systems and applications currently in use employ two digit fields to designate a year 
as a result  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
hence  the computerized systems used by the company must be reviewed  evaluated and if and where necessary  modified or replaced to ensure that all financial  information and operating systems are year yk compliant 
state of readiness the company has formed a yk project team  representing all business units  and staffed with subject matter experts to address yk readiness matters 
the yk project team s plan is made up of six phases inventory  assessment  remediation  test and acceptance  implementation  and contingency planning 
major areas being addressed by the yk project team include the cellular network  interconnect arrangements to connect the cellular network with landline systems  clearinghouse arrangements to allow verification and billing of roaming traffic  the company s wide area and local area networks  the company s internal communications systems  company server hardware  software and desktop systems  billing software and related elements  financial and operational reporting systems  information integration systems  critical suppliers including financial institutions  payroll benefits processing  credit bureaus  benefit plans  building systems  and office equipment 
with respect to internal matters  the project team has prepared an inventory of all computer hardware  software  and computer based systems 
the company has distributed inquiries and requests for yk readiness certification to all known system vendors 
although the company is still in the process of obtaining and assessing vendor responses and declarations of yk readiness  it has been determined that critical areas with non yk compliant software and hardware include switching and billing systems 
risks relating to yk compliance matters the failure of the company to upgrade its billing and switching systems to be yk ready may result in the company being unable to continue operations 
accordingly  the company is working toward yk certification of its various billing systems to insure yk readiness 
the company also upgraded its mtso software for two of its three switches in and has plans to upgrade the third switch software in the second quarter of the company anticipates having mission critical software and hardware remedied and yk ready by mid year and will continue testing throughout the third and fourth quarters of although the company believes that these efforts should result in a cellular network that will continue to function without material service affecting outages due to yk problems  network equipment suppliers have been unwilling to give unqualified warranties that network equipment is yk compliant 
service affecting outages  if prolonged and widespread  will materially affect the company s revenues 
the terms and conditions under which the company provides cellular and paging services to its customers contain provisions that limit the company s liability in the event that there is a service failure 
the terms and conditions provide that the company is not liable for any consequential or incidental damages to its customers 
they further provide that no credit will be given for service outages of less than hours in duration 
in addition  they limit damages for failure to provide service to a credit for the pro rated number of days that service was unavailable 
service affecting outages have occurred in limited geographic areas in the past and the company has not been found liable to any person for damages in excess of the limitations imposed by the terms and conditions of service 
the company believes it is unlikely that an outage occasioned by a failure attributable to a yk readiness would lead to a different result 
the company has adopted a policy of not giving any warranties to customers regarding yk readiness 
the company  at this time  does not anticipate any litigation involving the company that would arise as a result of yk readiness issues 
estimated yk compliance costs during  the company did not incur material costs related to bringing systems into yk compliance 
for  the company has budgeted million to cover costs associated with yk assessments  modifications  and associated upgrades 
third party providers the potential impact of the yk will also depend on the way in which the yk issue is addressed by customers  vendors  service providers  utilities  governmental agencies and other entities with which the company does business 
the company is communicating with these parties to learn how they are addressing the yk issue and to evaluate any likely impact on the company 
the company has requested commitment dates from the various parties as to their yk readiness and delivery of compliant software and other products 
the yk efforts of third parties are not within the company s control  however their failure to respond to yk issues successfully could result in business disruption and increased operating costs for the company 
at the present time  it is not possible to determine whether any such events are likely to occur  or to quantify any potential negative impact they may have on the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
contingency planning the company has begun the process of developing contingency plans that might be available in the event of either internal or external yk compliance problems 
to this end  the company s yk project team has begun to prepare potential contingency alternatives 
the company intends to complete its contingency planning in respect of yk compliance during the remainder of yk forward looking information the foregoing discussion regarding the yk project s timing  effectiveness  implementation  and cost  contains forward looking statements  which are based on management s best estimates derived using assumptions 
these forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by such statements 
factors that might cause material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of key yk personnel  the company s ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the readiness of third parties  and the company s ability to respond to unforeseen yk complications 
such material differences could result in  among other things  business disruption  operational problems  financial loss  legal liability and similar risks 
seasonality the company experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income loss 
somewhat offset by the new england acquisitions which have better roaming revenues year around  the company s average monthly roamer revenue per cellular customer increases during the second and third calendar quarters 
this increase reflects greater usage by the company s roamer customers who travel in the company s cellular service area for weekend and vacation recreation or work in seasonal industries  such as agriculture and construction 
because the company s cellular service area includes many seasonal recreational areas  the company expects that roamer revenues will continue to fluctuate seasonally more than service revenues
