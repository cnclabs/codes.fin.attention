the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand its service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs which must be recovered from future cash flow 
the ability of the subsidiary to recover this increased investment in facilities is dependent upon future revenue increases which are subject to approval by the connecticut department of public utility control 
page management does not presently plan to petition the dpuc for an increase in permanent rates in future economic and financial market conditions  coupled with governmental regulations and fiscal policy  plus other factors which are unpredictable and often beyond the control of the subsidiary  will influence when the subsidiary requests a revision to rates charged to its customers 
outlook the company s profitability is primarily attributable to the sale and distribution of water  the amount of which is dependent on seasonal weather fluctuations  particularly during the summer months when water demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels

year like many organizations  the company is currently evaluating and responding to its exposure to the year problem 
in general terms  the problem arises from the fact that many existing computer systems and other equipment containing date sensitive embedded technology including non information technology equipment and systems use only two digits to identify a year in the date field  with the assumption that the first two digits of the year are always 
as a result  such systems may misinterpret dates after december   which may result in miscalculations  other malfunctions or the total failure of such systems 
additional problems arise from the fact that the year is a special case leap year 
because the company is dependent upon the proper functioning of computer systems and other equipment containing date sensitive embedded technology  a failure of such systems and equipment to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company 
if not remedied  potential risks include business interruption or shutdown  financial loss  regulatory actions and legal liability 
page the company has established a team of senior managers to address the year problem 
this team is currently evaluating the company s exposure to the year problem and is preparing a plan for managing the risks and costs associated therewith 
the dpuc has informed the company that it will review the readiness of nine utilities  of which the company is one 
the company s general process of addressing the year problem can be broken down into the following steps a inventorying systems  equipment and other items including those of third parties that potentially present a year problem  b assigning priorities to identified items  c assessing the year compliance of the items determined to be material to the company through internal testing and outside certification  d repairing or replacing items determined to be non compliant  and e designing and implementing contingency plans around items that are identified to be subject to  a year problem but unable to be tested or otherwise determined to be compliant 
since  the company has been implementing a new management information system mis encompassing operational and administrative applications 
in addition to enhanced customer service technology and increased administrative and operational efficiencies  the new system is certified to be year compliant 
the integration of the new system is now complete 
the costs of implementing the new system totalled approximately million  which the company has capitalized 
the company has done preliminary internal testing of the mis and intends to complete its year testing of mis  during the second quarter of the company has found no indication that the mis is not year compliant as certified by its software or hardware vendors 
the company also is evaluating the year compliance of systems and equipment which are not linked to the mis and is in the process of identifying the items that could be impacted by the year problem 
the company expects that this inventory of items which may not be year compliant will be completed by the end of the first quarter once the company determines that an item may present a year problem  the company contacts the supplier to obtain adequate assurance that it is year compliant or determines and addresses any non compliance 
in addition  wherever practical  the company independently tests the item for compliance 
the company has obtained supplier compliance certification for approximately of the items that it has inventoried as potentially non compliant and has completed testing or has gotten vendor certification on approximately of such items 
the company estimates that this assessment process will be completed by the end of the first quarter of  and anticipates deploying and testing all repairs and replacements of non compliant systems and equipment by july  page in addition to its own systems and equipment  the company depends upon the proper function of computer systems and other date sensitive equipment of outside parties 
these parties include other water companies  banks  telecommunications service providers and electric and other utilities 
the company has initiated communications with such parties to determine the extent to which they are vulnerable to the year issue and  in certain circumstances  to coordinate joint testing 
the company has not yet received sufficient information about their remediation plans to predict the outcome of their efforts 
if the third parties with which the company interacts have year problems that are not remedied  resulting problems could include the loss of telecommunications and electrical service  the receipt of inaccurate financial and billing related information  and the disruption of capital flows potentially resulting in liquidity stress 
due to the uncertainties presented by such third party year problems  and the possibility that  despite its efforts  the company is unsuccessful in preparing its internal systems and equipment for the year  the company is developing contingency plans for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
such plans include manual back ups for crucial automated systems  the use of electrical generators capable of sustaining operations through a power failure  and enhanced transition period staffing to compensate for automation and communication failures 
the company s assessment of its most reasonably likely worst case scenario and the exact nature and scope of its contingency plans will be effected by the company s continued year assessment and testing 
the company expects to complete such assessment and contingency plans during the second or third quarter of and to have all contingency systems in place and fully tested by the fourth quarter of as the company already has extensive disaster contingency systems in place  it does not believe that the cost of preparing or effecting year contingency plans will be material 
the company does not believe that the costs of addressing the year problem  excluding the costs of the mis  will be material to the company s financial condition 
the company anticipates spending approximately  for effecting its year program in the company has funded  and expects to continue to fund  the costs of its year efforts through its operating cash flow 
the costs of the company s year program and the timetable for completing its year preparations are based on current estimates  which reflect numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  the timing and effectiveness of third party remediation plans and other factors 
the company can give no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those page currently anticipated 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s year program will be effective or that its contingency plans will be sufficient 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct relevant computer software codes and embedded technology  the results of internal and external testing and the timeliness and effectiveness of remediation efforts of third parties 
forward looking information this report  including management s discussion and analysis  contains certain forward looking statements regarding the company s results of operations and financial position 
these forward looking statements are based on current information and expectations  and are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from expected results
