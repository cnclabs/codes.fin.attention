item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
consolidated net sales increased in fiscal following an increase of in domestic sales increased in and in while foreign sales gained in and in the foreign sales gains in and were primarily the result of the acquisitions described below 
sales of the electronic segment represented of consolidated sales in  in and in electronic sales were flat in compared with sales 
sales in were up over sales 
sales to the automotive industry which represented  and of electronic segment sales in  and increased in and in fiscal electronic sales benefited from acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of fiscal sales of the optical segment represented of consolidated sales in and in both and optical sales grew in and in led by the explosive growth in sales of the company s optoelectronics products which increased in and in optical sales in were also helped by the acquisition of two european based optical connector companies during the year 
sales of other products chiefly current carrying bus devices and printed circuit boards increased in following a decline of in income from the settlement of litigation in fiscal represented the settlement of a claim relative to one of the company s patents 
other income consisted primarily of earnings from the company s automotive joint venture  interest income from short term investments  royalties and  in  an approximate  gain from the sale of a building 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for  and were  and 
the gross margin declines in and were largely due to margin erosion on sales to the automotive industry caused by product mix changes  additional infrastructure and engineering costs incurred for new programs not yet producing revenue and customer requested piece part sales price reductions 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were  and 
the increase in is partly due to an additional provision for bad debts of  the  provision for exiting printed circuit business in represents the estimated loss on disposal of assets  employee severance pay and additional costs associated with environmental matters specifically related to the decision to exit the business 
operating losses that will be incurred in the first half of fiscal to wind down these businesses are not expected to be material and will be recorded as incurred 
effective income tax rates were  and for fiscal   and the effective income tax rates for this three year period reflect the effects of lower tax rates from foreign operations offset  in part  by state income taxes 
the balance between these effects was altered by the acquisition of substantial business operations in lower tax locations in late the effective rate for was lower than and due to the effects of the substantially tax free gain on the sale of a building 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
net cash provided by operations was   and  in  and the decrease in cash provided from operations in and was primarily the result of lower net income and increased working capital requirements to support increased sales 
the company used  of cash in fiscal to acquire polycore technologies  a developer of highly integrated data communication modules for local area network equipment  stratos  ltd  a developer and manufacturer of expanded beam fiber optic connectivity products for harsh environments and an additional of optokon  a fiber optic connector company  from a former joint venture partner 
in connection with the acquisition of adam technologies  a designer and marketer of electrical and electronic connectors  the company made cash payments of  in   in and  in fiscal using available cash 
during fiscal the company used  of its available cash to acquire  shares of its common stock for treasury 
the purchases of these shares were made pursuant to a three year common stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in february  and based upon the belief that methode stock represents an excellent investment for the company 
depreciation and amortization expense was   and  in  and capital expenditures were   and  in  and principal capital investments involved the expansion of the automotive manufacturing and test laboratory facilities and purchases of machinery and equipment to support the increasing sales volume of optoelectronic devices and products for the automotive industry in  purchases of new facilities for an independent test laboratory and our cable assembly operations in and completion of a new research and test center in capital expenditures in  and were funded from operating cash flows 
it is anticipated that capital acquisitions for will also be funded from operating cash flows 
year conversion 
the year issue exists because many computer systems  applications and assets use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date change occurs  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to recognize or properly treat the year may cause systems to process financial and operations information incorrectly 
status of readiness the company s year strategy to make systems yk ready includes a common company wide focus on all internal systems potentially impacted by the yk issue  including information technology it systems and non it equipment and systems operating equipment that contain embedded computer technology 
each of the foregoing it and non it programs is being conducted in phases  described as follows inventory phase identify hardware or software that use or process date information 
assessment phase identify year date processing deficiencies and related implications 
planning phase determining for each deficiency an appropriate solution and budget as well as scheduling personnel and other resources 
implementation phase implement designated solutions and test systems 
the company is upgrading hardware and software for certain major computer systems which will concurrently address the year issues for those systems 
the company has fully completed its assessment of all systems that could be significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicates that most of the company s significant information technology systems could be affected  particularly the general ledger and billing systems 
the assessment also indicates  that in some instances  software and hardware embedded chips used in operating equipment also are at risk 
however  based on a review of its product line  the company has determined that the products it has sold and will continue to sell do not require remediation to be year ready 
for it systems  the company is complete on the implementation phase and expects to complete upgrade and replacement of the remaining systems by september for its non it systems  the company is in the process of bringing such systems into year readiness 
this remediation is complete 
the company expects to substantially complete this remediation effort by september the company has worked with third party suppliers to determine the year readiness of the company s systems that interface directly with third parties 
the company completed its remediation efforts on these systems with testing completed in march the company has queried its significant non it suppliers that do not share information systems with the company external agents 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion would indirectly impact the company  and the impact may be material 
the company also is making inquiries as to the year readiness of selected customers and service vendors 
the company will have a contingency plan in place no later than october to compensate for those external agents that fail to complete their year resolution by the end of costs as of april   the company s total incremental costs historical plus estimated future costs of system upgrades and addressing year issues are estimated to be  of which  has been incurred  expensed and  capitalized for new systems and equipment 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flow 
of the total remaining project costs  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software and equipment which will be capitalized 
the remaining  will be expensed as incurred 
the company estimates that a substantial portion of these costs are attributable to system upgrades that would have been incurred regardless of the year issue 
implementation of the company s year plan is an ongoing process 
consequently  the above described estimates of costs and completion dates for the various components of the plan are subject to change 
risks the company s year readiness program is directed primarily toward ensuring that the company will be able to continue to perform five critical functions a order and receive raw material and supplies  b make and sell its products  c invoice customers and collect payments  d pay its employees and suppliers and e maintain accurate accounting records 
while the company currently believes that it will be able to modify or replace its effected systems in time to minimize any significant detrimental effects on its operations  failure to do so  or the failure of key third parties to modify or replace their effected systems  could have materially adverse impacts on the company s business operations or financial condition 
in particular  because of the interdependent nature of business systems  the company could be materially adversely affected if private businesses  utilities and governmental entities with which it does business or that provide essential products or services are not year ready 
reasonably likely consequences of failure by the company or third parties to resolve the year problem include  among other things  temporary slowdowns of manufacturing operations at one or more company facilities  billing and collection errors  delays in the distribution of products and delays in the receipt of supplies 
the company s expectations about future costs necessary to achieve year readiness  the impact on its operations and its ability to bring each of its systems into year readiness are subject to a number of uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially 
such factors include the following i the company may not be successful in properly identifying all systems and programs that contain two digit year codes  ii the nature and number of systems which require reprogramming  upgrading or replacement may exceed the company s expectations in terms of complexity and scope  iii the company may not be able to complete all remediation and testing necessary in a timely manner  iv the company s key suppliers and other third parties may not be able to supply the company with components or materials which are necessary to manufacture its products  with sufficient electrical power and other utilities to sustain its manufacturing process  or with adequate  reliable means of transporting its products to its customers 
contingency plans contingency plans for suppliers and mission critical systems impacted by year issues are currently under development 
it is anticipated that year contingency plans will be completed by september contingency plans may include stockpiling raw materials  increasing inventory levels  securing alternate sources of supply and other appropriate measures 
once developed  year contingency plans and related cost estimates will be continually refined as additional information becomes available 
euro conversion 
on january   eleven member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legal currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the euro is now trading on currency exchanges and may be used in certain transactions such as electronic payments 
beginning in january  new euro denominated notes and coins will be used  and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the conversion to the euro has eliminated currency exchange rate risk for transactions between the member countries  which for the company primarily consists of sales to certain customers and payments to certain suppliers 
the company is currently addressing the issues involved with the new currency  which include converting information technology systems  recalculating currency risk  and revising processes for preparing accounting and taxation records 
based on the work completed so far  the company does not believe the euro conversion will have a significant impact on the results of its operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk although certain of the company s subsidiaries enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  foreign currency exposures arising from these transactions are not material to the company 
the primary foreign currency exposure arises from the translation of the company s net equity investment in its foreign subsidiaries to us dollars 
the company generally views as long term its investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed are the singapore dollar  maltese lira and other european currencies 
the fair value of the company s net foreign investments would not be materially affected by a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from april  levels
