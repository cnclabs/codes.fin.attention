see company operations operating strategy 
the company has been  and expects to continue to be  dependent on third party financing for its cash needs in connection with operating losses as well as with its acquisition and development of communities 
there can be no assurance that financing for these requirements will be available to the company on acceptable terms 
moreover  to the extent the company acquires communities that do not generate positive cash flow  the company may be required to seek additional capital or borrowings for working capital and liquidity purposes 
year general the company has developed a plan the plan to modify its information technology to address year problems 
the concerns surrounding the year are the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
programs that employ time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause system errors or failures 
plan the plan is comprised of three components including assessment of a the it infrastructure hardware and systems software other than application software  b application software  and b third party suppliers vendors 
the company commenced work on the plan in the fourth quarter of by taking inventory of year problems in the areas of it infrastructure as well as application software 
in addition  the company has determined the priority of the items based on their materiality to the company s operations 
no material items have been noted to date 
for each component  the company will address year problems in six phases taking inventory of year problems  assigning priorities to identified items  assessing materiality of items to the company s operations  replacing repairing material non compliant items  testing material items  and designing and implementing business continuation plans 
material items are those believed by the company to have a risk that may affect revenue or may cause a discontinuation of operations 
the company estimates a completion date of june  costs the project is not expected to be material to the company s operations or financial position 
the total cost is not expected to exceed  of which approximately  have been incurred to date 
risks the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially affect the company s results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition due  in part  to uncertainty regarding compliance by third parties 
the plan is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty regarding the year problem  however  particularly compliance and readiness of its third party suppliers vendors 
the company believes that  with the completion of the plan as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations will be reduced and  therefore  a contingency plan has not been deemed necessary to date 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company 
inflation could  however  affect the company s future revenues and operating income due to the company s dependence on its senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for the company s services 
as a result  the company s ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
the company typically does not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs 
in pricing its services  the company attempts to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
forward looking statements safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this report that are not historical or current facts deal with potential future circumstances  operations  and prospects 
the discussion of such matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally  and also may materially differ from the company s actual future experience involving any one or more of such matters and subject areas relating to demand  pricing  competition  construction  licensing  permitting  construction delays on new developments contractual and licensure  and other delays on the disposition of assisted living communities in the company s portfolio  and the ability of the company to continue managing its costs while maintaining high occupancy rates and market rate assisted living charges in its assisted living communities 
the company has attempted to identify  in context  certain of the factors that they currently believe may cause actual future experience and results to differ from the company s current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area 
these and other risks and uncertainties are detailed in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  including the company s annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of its short and long term borrowings 
the company manages this risk by obtaining fixed rate borrowings when possible 
at december   the company s variable rate borrowings totaled million 
if market interest rates average more in than they did in  the company s interest expense would increase and income before taxes would decrease by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s outstanding variable rate borrowings as of december  and does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings which may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment nor does it consider likely actions that management could take with respect to the company s financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change
