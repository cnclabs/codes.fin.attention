item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of the company s financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated 
the company s consolidated financial statements and supplementary data and the related notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview the company was organized as a delaware corporation in august in connection with the initial public offering the offering and related combination of certain entities that held interests in the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties  herein referred to as the combination 
in a series of combination transactions the company issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received in exchange of the ownership interests in the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties 
in march  and contemporaneously with the combination  the company completed the offering of  shares of its common stock generating proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
the company began operations in and until generated exploratory drilling prospects based on d seismic data for sale to other exploration and production companies 
during  as a result of the advent of economic onshore d seismic surveys and the improvement and increased affordability of data interpretation technologies  the company changed its strategy to emphasize exploration based upon the use of d seismic data 
from to  the company reduced its inventory of d based prospects  began limited drilling for its own account and began developing prospects based on d seismic data 
since early  the company has almost exclusively drilled prospects generated from d seismic data  while accelerating its drilling activity and increasing its working interests in new project areas primarily in south texas and louisiana 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
investments in unproved properties are not subject to amortization until the proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impaired 
to the extent that capitalized costs subject to amortization in the full cost pool net of depletion  depreciation and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  an impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties is assessed on a quarterly basis in conjunction with the company s quarterly filings with the commission 
at december  the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of approximately million 
the company s revenues  profitability  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of its properties  are substantially dependent on prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
declines in prices received for oil and natural gas may have an adverse affect on the company s financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower prices may also impact the amount of reserves that can be produced economically by the company 
due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  the company has entered into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps and collars for a portion of its natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limits the benefit to the company of increases in the price of natural gas it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
the company s hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in natural gas prices and limits potential gains from future increases in prices 
the company accounts for these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  gains and losses are included in oil and natural gas revenues during the period the hedged transactions occur 
during and the company had in place several natural gas commodity collars with a financial institution covering  mmbtus per day  or approximately of the company s daily production 
prices received float between a floor and cap price per mmbtu  delivered price basis  houston ship channel  with settlement for each calendar month occurring five business days following the publishing of the inside ferc gas marketing report 
included within natural gas revenues for the years ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively  representing net settlement gains from collar activities 
there were no active collar agreements in place at december  during december  the company entered into a fixed price swap for per mmbtu 
this fixed price swap covers  mmbtu per day  or approximately of daily production  and is effective beginning march  and expires on october  there was no material hedging activity during the year ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenues increased from million in to million in production volumes for oil decreased from  bbls in to  bbls in the decrease in oil production decreased revenues by approximately  further decreased by a decrease in average oil prices that reduced revenues by approximately  production volumes for natural gas increased from  mcf in to  mcf in the increase in natural gas production increased revenues by approximately million 
a decrease in average natural gas prices decreased revenues by approximately million 
the overall net increase in oil and natural gas production was due to new gross  net  producing exploratory and development wells drilled and completed since december  partially offset by production declines from existing wells 
included within natural gas revenues for the two years ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively  representing net gains from collar activity 
the collar settlements increased the effective average natural gas prices by per mcf and per mcf  respectively  for the two years ended december  and the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenues for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared to december  period increase increase decrease decrease production volumes oil and condensate bbls    natural gas mcf    natural gas equivalents mcfe    average sales prices oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf operating revenues oil and condensate    natural gas    total    costs and operating expenses oil and natural gas operating expenses increased from million in to million in due to increased production generated from new oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed in oil and natural gas operating expenses on a unit of production basis were per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a increased from million in to million in included within dd a for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing depletion expense of oil and natural gas properties 
a increase in the overall depletion rate increased depletion expense by approximately million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to revisions of oil and natural gas reserve estimates as of december  and the abandonment during the fourth quarter of of certain projects  portions of projects and prospects located in non core areas 
additionally  the depletion rate was further increased due to the change in accounting method see note to the consolidation financial statements which increased depletion expense by approximately  during the year ended december  increased oil and natural gas production further increased depletion expense by approximately  depletion on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and was per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the remaining increase in dd a was due primarily to depreciation of new computer hardware and software and office furniture purchased during the fourth quarter of and the amortization of deferred loan cost incurred as a result of a new credit facility executed during april the securities and exchange commission requires that the carrying cost of proved reserves be assessed periodically for ceiling test impairment 
at december  the discounted future net revenues of the company s proved reserves were million 
as a result of the company s carrying cost of proved reserves being in excess of the present value using a discount rate of the company recorded a full cost ceiling test write down of its oil and natural gas properties of approximately million 
there have been no write downs of its oil and natural gas properties in prior years 
general and administrative expense g a was million for each of the years ended december  and excluding the effects of the change in accounting method referred to in note to the consolidated financial statements  g a increased by million which was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional employees to support the company s increased level of exploration activities and d project generation and costs associated with being a public company and general office overhead

for the year ended december   the company had an operating loss of million as compared to operating income of million in the significant decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to increased depletion expense  a full cost ceiling test write down and the other charge  referred to above  which was further reduced by increased operating costs and expenses related to the new well additions gross  net and lower average commodity prices for both oil and natural gas 
these decreases in operating income were partially offset by higher levels of production from new well additions 
net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million  million before cumulative effect of accounting change  or basic and diluted loss per share of  as compared to net income of million  or basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenues increased from million in to million in production volumes for oil increased from  bbls in to  bbls in the increase in oil production increased revenues by approximately million  which was partially offset by an decrease in average oil prices that reduced revenues by approximately  production volumes for natural gas increased from  mcf in to  mcf in the increase in natural gas production increased revenues by approximately million 
a increase in average natural gas prices increased revenues by approximately  the overall net increase in oil and natural gas production was due to new gross  net  producing exploratory and development wells drilled and completed since december  partially offset by normal production declines from existing wells 
included within natural gas revenues for the year ended december  was approximately  representing a net gain from current collar activity 
the collar settlements increased the effective average natural gas prices by per mcf for the year ended december  the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenues for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period compared december  to period increase increase decrease decrease production volumes oil and condensate bbls    natural gas mcf    natural gas equivalent mcfe    average sales prices oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf operating revenues oil and condensate    natural gas    total    costs and operating expenses oil and natural gas operating expenses increased from million in to million in due to increased production generated from new oil and natural gas wells drilled and completed in oil and natural gas operating expenses on a unit of production basis were per mcfe and mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease on a unit of production basis is primarily attributable to the disproportionate increase in natural gas production during  which has a lower average production cost per mcfe compared to oil 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense dd a increased from million in to million in included within dd a for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing depletion expense of oil and natural gas properties 
the increase in depletion expense was primarily due to increased oil and natural gas production  which increased depletion expense by approximately million 
a increase in the overall depletion rate increased depletion expense by approximately  the increase in depletion rate was primarily due to an increase in future development cost for proved undeveloped oil and natural gas properties of approximately million and a bcfe downward revision to prior year oil and natural gas reserve volume estimates 
depletion on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and was per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the remaining increase in dd a was due primarily to depreciation of new computer hardware and software and office furniture purchased since december   which was partially offset by decreased amortization of deferred loan costs 
general and administrative expense g a increased from million in to million in this increase was attributable to additional administrative staffing and the hiring of additional employees to support the company s increased level of exploration activities  d project generation and other activities 
included as a reduction in g a for the years ended december  and  was approximately  and  respectively  of overhead reimbursements and management fees received from various management  operating and seismic agreements 
general and administrative expenses on a unit of production basis for the years ended december  and were per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
unearned compensation expense for the year ended december  was  due to the amortization of unearned compensation expense recognized from restricted stock granted to executives at the completion of the offering

accounting change the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
in the second quarter of and effective january   the company changed its method of accounting for direct internal geological and geophysical g g costs to one of capitalization of such costs  which are directly attributable to acquisition  exploration and development activities  to oil and natural gas property 
prior to the change the company expensed these costs as incurred 
the company believes the accounting change provides for a better matching of revenues and expenses and enhances the comparability of its results of operations with those of other oil and natural gas companies that follow the full cost method of accounting see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year the company has completed its assessment of the year processing issues of its internal technology systems  considering current financial and accounting  production  land and geological computer systems and software utilized by the company 
due to the need for improved management reporting  the company is in the process of replacing its existing financial and accounting  production and land applications with new software which is year compliant 
implementation is expected to be completed on or before june  at a total cost of approximately  as of december   the company has incurred approximately  converting to its new financial and accounting system and software with a majority of the remaining cost to be incurred prior to march  production and land applications will be operational on or before june  these costs have been funded from cash flows from operations and the cost of the new software and necessary hardware upgrades have been capitalized 
based on assertions made by vendors  the company believes its geological systems and software are year compliant 
in addition the company is performing other forms of due diligence to ensure that its geological systems are compliant 
the company is also in the process of evaluating the risk presented by potential year non compliance by third parties 
because such risks vary substantially  companies are being contacted based on the estimated magnitude of risk posed to the company by their year non compliance 
the company anticipates that these efforts will continue through and will not result in significant costs to the company 
the company s assessment of its year issues involves many assumptions 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumptions will prove accurate  and actual results could differ significantly from the assumptions 
in conducting its year compliance efforts  the company has relied primarily on vendor representations with respect to internal computerized systems and representations from third parties with which the company has business relationships and has not independently verified representations 
there can be no assurance that these representations will prove accurate 
a year failure could result in a business interruption that adversely effects the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
although it is not currently aware of any likely business disruptions  the company is developing a contingency plan to address and assess the readiness of its material suppliers  customers and other entities as it relates to year processing issues and expects this work to be completed on or before december  the company is not insured for this type of loss should a loss occur 
the foregoing statements are intended to be and are hereby designated year readiness disclosures within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
accounting pronouncements derivatives in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities that require an entity to recognize all derivatives as an asset or liability measured at fair value 
depending on the intended use of the derivatives  changes in its fair value will be reported in the period of change as either a component of earnings or a component of other comprehensive income 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after june  earlier application of sfas is encouraged  but not prior to the beginning of any fiscal quarter that begins after issuance of the statement 
retroactive application to periods prior to adoption is not allowed 
the company has not quantified the impact of adoption on its financial statements or the date it intends to adopt 
comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting of comprehensive income sfas 
sfas establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components 
sfas is effective for periods beginning after december  the purpose of reporting comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in equity of an enterprise that results from recognized transactions and other economic events of the period other than transactions with owners in their capacity as owners 
as of december   there are no adjustments other comprehensive income to net income loss in deriving comprehensive income 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
the company uses a revolving credit facility  which has a floating interest rate  to finance a portion of its operations 
the company is not subject to fair value risk resulting from changes in its floating interest rates 
the use of floating rate debt instruments provide benefit due to downward interest rate movements but does not limit the company to exposure from future increases in interest rates 
based on december  floating interest rate of  a change in interest rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately  on an annual basis 
in the normal course of business the company enters into hedging transactions  including commodity price collars and swaps  to mitigate its exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
n  due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  the company has entered into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps and collars for a portion of its natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limits the benefit to the company of increases in the price of natural gas it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
during december  the company entered into a fixed price swap for per mmbtu 
this fixed price swap covers  mmbtu per day  or approximately of daily production  and is effective beginning march  and expires on october  at december   the fair value of this swap was approximately 
a change in the natural gas swap price per mmbtu would cause the total fair value of the swap to increase or decrease by approximately  per month
