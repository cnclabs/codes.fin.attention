sales to international customers represented of sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal net revenue for fiscal was higher than net revenue for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of large system products to service provider customers offset in part by lower sales of cpe systems and upgrade products and small system sales 
sales to international customers represented of sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal this percentage increase was due primarily to increased large orders from latin america and the pacific rim in cpe sales decreased for fiscal as compared to the prior year due to reduced orders from the company s distributors 
these reduced cpe sales were a result of increased competition from pc based systems providers whose products compete with the company s small system products 
on a pro forma basis  net revenue for fiscal was lower than due to reduced large system orders from europe and the pacific rim 
on a pro forma basis  net revenue for fiscal was higher than due to the same factors affecting the service provider business as noted above 
gross margin gross margin for decreased to from in the prior year 
this decrease reflects lower sales of and lower margins in the company s large systems products which typically carry higher profit margins due to increased sales price competition and reduced international sales from the pacific rim due to slower economic growth 
gross margin for decreased to from in fiscal this decrease in gross margin reflects lower margins on upgrade and expansion products and customer services offset by a favorable mix of increased sales of large system products and lower provisions for retrofit obligations and inventory obsolescence 
on a pro forma basis  gross margin was   and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin of from to and the decrease from to reflects the same factors as noted above in connection with the service provider business 
research development research and development r d expenses for were below this decrease reflects reduced payroll expenses and related costs resulting from lower average engineering staffing levels due to the cpe sale 
r d expenses for fiscal were higher than fiscal this increase reflects higher payroll expenses resulting from higher average engineering staffing levels and increased supplies and outside services expenses 
as a percentage of net revenue  r d expenses were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company believes that ongoing development of new products and features is required to maintain and enhance its competitive position 
the company expects to continue to invest in r d and therefore r d expenses should continue to increase  notwithstanding the level of sales realized in future quarters 
on a pro forma basis  r d expenses decreased million in from reflecting savings from lower r d staffing levels and related costs 
also  expenses were higher in fiscal resulting from the release in the first quarter of the series platform without comparable expenses in on a pro forma basis  r d expenses increased million from to because of increased staffing levels and related costs and costs associated with the release of the series platform in selling  general administrative selling  general administrative sg a expenses in were below fiscal this decrease reflects primarily reduced salaries and benefits and related expenses in the sales and marketing functions due to the cpe sale

the company believes that continued investments in sales and marketing  particularly in export markets  are essential to maintaining its competitive position and that the dollar amount of sg a expenses will increase in future periods 
on a pro forma basis  sg a expenses increased million in over and million in over these increases reflect primarily increases in salaries and benefits in the sales and marketing functions 
non recurring charges non recurring charges were million  and million for and  respectively 
the non recurring charges consisted of million for the write off of ipr d acquired in the purchase of ttc and million associated with the company s patent dispute with lucent technologies 
see acquisition and revision of purchase price allocation 
the non recurring charges consisted of million in restructuring expenses and million associated with the termination of acquisition discussions with voice tel enterprises and voice tel network voice tel 
these restructuring expenses represented termination benefits for approximately employees from all functions of the company and costs associated with the resignation of the company s president and chief executive officer 
the company restructured its business to align its operational expense with its anticipated revenue levels 
cash payment termination benefits of million and million were paid in fiscal and  respectively 
other income and expense  net other income and expense  net was million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
interest income on investments increased million to million in fiscal due to higher average investment balances although interest yields on investments were lower in versus interest income on investments increased in fiscal over due to higher average investment balances and higher average interest rates 
in addition to the company s net investment income  other income and expense in included the million gain on the cpe sale and in a million gain on the sale of the company s text to speech business 
provision for income taxes the company recorded income tax provision of   and  respectively  for fiscal years  and the and tax provisions consist of minimum federal  state  and foreign taxes 
an additional provision of  was provided in fiscal year  resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance for previously recognized deferred tax assets that were no longer realizable through potentially refundable taxes 
the income tax provision primarily represents current foreign taxes 
no income tax benefits were recorded for the losses incurred in fiscal years and because realization of the deferred tax asset arising as a result of the losses sustained is dependent upon future taxable income  the amount and timing of which are uncertain 
accordingly  a valuation allowance has been established to fully offset the deferred tax asset other than that which represents potentially refundable taxes 
liquiidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at october  were million  increasing million from november  at the end of fiscal and  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million and million  respectively 
net cash used for operating activities was million during fiscal trade receivables at the end of fiscal decreased million from the prior year balance primarily due to improved collection efforts and a reduction in extended payment terms to certain international service provider customers 
days sales outstanding computed using quarterly revenues were days at the end of fiscal compared to days at end of fiscal this decrease in dso was primarily due to the factors noted above 
inventory levels at october  decreased million from fiscal because of improved inventory management 
the company expects investment in receivables and inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
the company accrued million in fiscal in connection with its settlement with lucent and paid this amount in november during the fiscal year ended october   the company made million in capital expenditures 
a significant portion of these expenditures were related to the purchase of engineering equipment and computer equipment for all functions 
the company currently expects to spend approximately million for capital equipment during fiscal  although no assurance can be given that expenditures will not be higher or lower 
during fiscal the company sold its cpe business unit to mitel for million in cash  and the company purchased substantially all of the assets of ttc for approximately million 
in april  the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby up to one million shares of its common stock may be repurchased in the open market from time to time 
in september  the repurchase of an additional  shares was authorized 
during and  the company purchased  and  shares  respectively  at a total cost of approximately million under this repurchase program 
the company s principal sources of liquidity as of october  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million available under the company s bank line of credit which expires may  
the company expects to renew this bank line in fiscal this bank line requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios  minimum working capital  minimum tangible net worth and financial performance benchmarks  and requires the banks consent for the payment of cash dividends 
the company is in compliance with this agreement and there were no borrowings outstanding under the bank line as of october  the company presently believes  notwithstanding its accumulated deficit  that its existing cash and short term investments and credit under its line of credit will be sufficient to support the company s working capital and capital equipment purchase requirements at least through fiscal certain trends and uncertainties the company has in the past experienced and will likely in the future experience substantial fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
for instance  the company has typically experienced a slowdown in its sales levels in the first quarter of its fiscal year 
the company generally has no long term order commitments from its customers  and a significant portion of bookings and shipments in any quarter have historically occurred near the end of the quarter 
accordingly  the company has historically operated with very little backlog  and net revenue has been difficult to predict 
in addition  the portion of backlog shippable in the next quarter varies over time 
as a result  revenue in future quarters will depend largely on the level of orders received during such quarters 
the company continues to obtain a large percentage of its sales from its international operations  including sales from the pacific rim 
in addition to the business risks associated with international operations  the recent economic turmoil has increased the uncertainty regarding future sales of the company s products in the pacific rim 
see sales and distribution for a description of certain risks associated with the company s international operations 
if new order bookings do not meet expected levels  or if the company experiences delays in shipments at the end of a quarter  operating results will be adversely affected  and these developments may not become apparent to the company until near or at the end of a quarter 
net revenue can also be affected by product sales mix  distribution mix  the size and timing of customer orders and shipments  customer returns and reserves provided therefor  competitive pricing pressures  the effectiveness of key distributors in selling the company s products  changes in distributor inventory levels  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors  regulatory approvals  and the availability of components for the company s products  each of which is difficult to predict accurately 
each of such factors has in the past affected the company s revenue 
the company has in the past experienced higher than usual headcount turnover which has had an adverse effect on the company s booking levels 
there can be no assurance that such turnover will not continue in future periods 
any failure by the company to attract  retain and train additional sales and other personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
approximately of the company s sales in fiscal consisted of sales outside of the united states 
the company s international sales are subject to a number of additional risks generally associated with international sales  including the effect on demand for the company s products in international markets as the result of any strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  the effect of currency fluctuations on consolidated multinational financial results  state imposed restrictions on the repatriation of funds  import and export duties and restrictions  the need to modify products for local markets  and the logical difficulties of managing multinational operations 
in particular  the company s sales in the pacific rim have been adversely affected in recent quarters by financial difficulties in that region and may be so adversely affected in the future 
a significant portion of the company s net revenue is attributable to a limited number of customers 
the company s top five customers  representing a combination of major distributors and service providers  accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  although the company s five largest customers were not the same in these periods 
the company has no long term order commitments from any of its customers 
any material reduction in orders from one or more such customers or the cancellation or deferral of any significant portion of backlog could have an adverse effect on net revenue and operating results 
such concentration of sales typically results in a corresponding concentration of accounts receivable 
although the company has established reserves for uncollectible accounts  the inability of any large customer to pay the company could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see risk and uncertainties note to consolidated financial statements 
the company s gross margin can be affected by a number of factors  including changes in product  distribution channel  and customer mix  cost and availability of parts and components  royalty obligations to suppliers of licensed software  provisions for warranty  retrofits  and excess and obsolete inventory  customer returns  and competitive pressures on pricing 
the company has experienced increasing competitive pricing pressure in all markets and expects this pricing pressure to continue 
further  distributors purchase products at discounts  and the company s margins can therefore vary depending upon the mix of distributor and direct sales in any particular fiscal period 
the company anticipates that its sales mix will fluctuate in future periods 
as a result of the above factors  gross margin fluctuations are difficult to predict  and gross margins may decline from current levels in future periods 
the company s future success will depend in part upon the ability of the company to continue to introduce new features and products as the company s markets evolve  new technologies become available  and customers demand additional functionality 
the company s competitors continue to add functionality to their products  and any failure by the company to introduce in a timely manner new products and features that meet customer requirements would adversely affect the company s operating results and cash flows 
the company s ability to develop such new features and products depends in large measure on its ability to hire and retain qualified technical talent and outside contractors in highly competitive markets for such services 
there can be no assurance that the company s product development efforts will be successful  or that it will be able to introduce new products in a timely manner 
in this regard  the company during fiscal  announced significant new products  after experiencing delays in the introduction of such products 
moreover  customers expectations of the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors can adversely affect sales of current products 
in addition  upon the introduction of new products  the company could be subject to higher customer returns with respect to prior generations of products  which could adversely affect financial position  operating results and cash flows 
the company presently uses third parties to perform printed circuit board and subsystem assembly 
although the company has not experienced significant problems with third party manufacturers in the past  there can be no assurance that such problems will not develop in the future 
in addition  certain components used in the company s products  including certain microprocessors  line cards  power supplies  disk drives  application cards and other semiconductor devices and other components are available from sole sources 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of components in a timely manner from existing sources or  when necessary  from alternative sources of supply 
however  the inability to develop such alternative sources if and as required in the future  or to obtain sufficient sole or limited source components as required  would have a material adverse affect on the company s operating results and cash flows 
in addition  the company s products are dependent on the qnx software operating system  a multitasking  real time operating system for intel microprocessor based computers 
in future periods  the company s products may become increasingly dependent on software licensed from third party suppliers 
there can be no assurance such licenses will continue to be available to the company as needed or at commercially reasonable prices 
in addition  a number of other companies  including competitors of the company  also hold patents in the same general area as the technology used by the company 
the company has obtained licenses to use certain intellectual property  including patents  from others 
the company from time to time has received  and may receive in the future  letters alleging infringement of patent rights by the company s products 
for example  in december  representatives of lucent technologies lucent informed the company that they believed that the company s products may infringe upon certain patents issued to lucent  and that lucent was seeking compensation for any past infringement by the company 
the company evaluated the assertions of lucent  and in october settled by signing an intellectual property cross licensing agreement and in november paid lucent million 
see patents  trade secrets and licenses 
third party companies alleging infringement could seek an injunction prohibiting the company from selling some or all of its products  which would have an immediate  adverse impact in the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any litigation to enjoin the company from selling its products on the basis of such alleged infringement  or that the company would be able to license any valid and infringed patents on reasonable terms  or at all 
like many other companies  the year computer issue creates risks for centigram 
if internal systems do not correctly recognize and process date information beyond the year  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
to address the year issues with its internal systems  the company has initiated a comprehensive program which is designed to deal with the most critical systems first 
assessment and remediation are proceeding in tandem  and the company currently plans to have changes to critical systems completed and tested by mid these activities are intended to encompass all major categories of systems in use by the company  including manufacturing  sales  customer service  finance and administration 
the company is also actively working with critical suppliers of products and services to determine that the suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year capable or to monitor their progress toward year capability 
in addition  the company has commenced work on various types of contingency planning to address potential problems areas with internal systems and with suppliers and other third parties 
it is expected that assessment  remediation and contingency planing activities will be on going throughout  with the goal of appropriately resolving all material internal systems and third party issues 
the company also has a program to assess the capability of its products to handle the year the company believes that its products are year compliant  although there can be no assurance of this 
the company is incurring various costs to provide customer support and customer satisfaction services regarding year issues  and it is anticipated that these expenditures will continue through and thereafter 
as used by centigram  year capable means that when used properly and in conformity with the product information provided by centigram  the centigram product will accurately store  display  process  provide  and or receive data from  into  and between the twentieth and twenty first centuries  including leap year calculations  provided that all other technology used in combination with the centigram product properly exchanges date data with the centigram product 
the costs incurred to date related to these programs are less than  the company currently expects that the total cost of these programs  including both incremental spending and redeployed resources  will not exceed  although there can be no assurance of this 
the total cost estimate does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims or the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
in some instances  the installation schedule of new software and hardware in the normal course of business is being accelerated to also afford a solution to year capability issues 
the total cost estimate is based on the current assessment of the projects and is subject to change as the projects progress 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that the year matters discussed above related to internal systems or products sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations  however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier or another third party would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
in recent years  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume trading volatility 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many high technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad markets fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in addition  the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of new products or technological innovations by the company or its competitors  and general conditions in the computer and communications industries 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company maintains a strict investment policy which ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the table below presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s investment portfolio as of october  fair in thousands therafter total value cash equivalents fixed rate    average rate short term investments fixed rate     average rate total securities     average rate the company endeavors to mitigate default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains what the company believes is a prudent amount of diversification 
the company has cash flow exposure on the interest expense related to its million line of credit due to the rates which vary with the banks reference rate 
at october  the company had no borrowings against its line of credit 
the company conducts business on a global basis and sells its products in us dollars  except for an occasional sale in british pounds 
when the company is exposed to adverse or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the realized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and offset against realized and unrealized gains and losses from the settlement of the related receivables 
at october   the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts were  the unrealized loss on the contracts at october  was  an adverse change in the british pound of approximately would result in an unrealized loss of approximately
