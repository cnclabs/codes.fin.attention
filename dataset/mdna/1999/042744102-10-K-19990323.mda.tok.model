glens falls national bank acquired substantially all deposits at the branches and most of the loans held by fleet bank related to the branches 
total deposit liabilities at the branches assumed by glens falls national bank were approximately million and the total amount of branch related loans acquired was approximately million 
under the purchase agreement  glens falls national bank also acquired from fleet an additional million of residential real estate loans not related to the branches 
divestiture of vermont operations during  in three separate transactions  the company completed the divestiture of its vermont subsidiary  green mountain bank gmb

all significant assets relating to the business or operations of gmb have been sold  except for the building which served as gmb s main office in rutland  vt  which was held for sale at december  total loans and deposits transferred in the three vermont sale transactions amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
these and other changes are more fully described in the following analysis of the results of operations and changes in financial condition 
the net gain realized on these sale transactions in  net of tax  was approximately million 
b 
results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  presents the factors that are primarily responsible for the company s results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income fully taxable basis net interest income represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and costs paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of earning assets and the net interest margin

interest expense      net interest income      on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income was million in  an increase of million  or from million in factors contributing to the million increase in net interest income are discussed in the following section 
analysis of changes in net interest income the following table presents net interest income components on a tax equivalent basis and reflects changes between periods attributable to movement in either the average daily balances or average rates for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately between the categories

the change in net interest income due to changes in rate was a decrease of million in and a decrease of million in the federal reserve board attempts to influence prevailing federal funds and prime interest rates and sets changes to the federal reserve bank discount rate 
the following chart presents recent changes key interest rate changes federal discount funds prime date rate rate rate november  october  september  march  january  in the fall of  after months of relative interest rate stability  the federal reserve board took steps in its open market operations leading to three basis point decreases in the federal funds target rate  which led to parallel changes in the prime rate 
net interest margin for  at  represented a basis point decrease from the net interest margin of in this reflects a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets and a basis point decrease in the cost of paying liabilities from to the decrease in net interest margin was primarily attributable to three factors i the lack of any significant slope to the yield curve the normal slope of the yield curve is caused by higher yields for instruments with longer maturities was the most significant factor leading to the decrease in net interest margin from to  since the company was unable to obtain the same spread as in prior periods between longer term interest bearing liabilities and earning assets as those items repriced 
ii the fact that the decrease in the yield on earning assets was greater than the decrease in the cost of paying liabilities from to reflected the competitive environment for loan products in the company s market area 
iii the company took advantage of its borrowing arrangement with the federal home loan bank fhlb during these fhlb borrowings  amounting to million by year end  were primarily secured by family residential real estate loans 
the spread that the company was able to earn on the difference between the rates on the fhlb advances and in invested funds  was less than the company s total net interest spread 
however  there was a positive increase to net interest income  even though there was a negative impact on net interest margin 
in the to analysis  the negative impact on net interest income attributable to rate changes was million 
although the federal reserve board did not raise the discount rate during  its open market operations early in led directly to a basis point increase in the federal funds overnight rate 
this increase in the cost of federal funds was mirrored in an overall increase in the cost of funds to the company  while at the same time its yield on earning assets decreased 
the net interest margin for  at  represented a basis point decrease from the net interest margin of in this reflected a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets and a basis point increase in the cost of paying liabilities from to a significant shift in the mix of earning assets between the two periods accounted for most of the decrease in the yield on earning assets 
after the sale of the remaining vermont branches at the end of september  and particularly after the june acquisition of the six fleet branches  the company maintained a significantly larger portion of its earning assets in securities and federal funds sold  which were at lower yields than the company s loan portfolio 
this was due to the fact that the vermont banking operations maintained a high loan to deposit ratio during the period whereas the loan to deposit ratio of the fleet branches acquired was much lower  the lower yielding liquid assets received from fleet were only gradually reinvested in securities and loans 
the to change was further exasperated by the fact that  in the period  the yield on loans in the vermont portfolio was temporarily boosted as a result of unexpected payments on certain restructured loans reported in that period as interest income 
also contributing to the to decline in net interest margin was a shift in the new york based loan portfolio of loan products between the years favoring lower yielding indirect loans 
a discussion of the impact on net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates vis a vis the repricing patterns of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands change change earning assets      interest bearing liabilities      demand deposits      total assets      earning assets to total assets 

in general  changes in the volume of earning assets and paying liabilities will result in corresponding changes in net interest income 
however  changes due to volume can be enhanced or restricted by shifts within the relative mix of earning assets or interest bearing liabilities between instruments of different rates 
the change in net interest income due to changes in volume was an increase of million in and a decrease of thousand in average earning assets increased by million  or  between and average interest bearing liabilities increased similarly  by  between the two years 
this increase in volume led to a million increase in net interest income from to while the fleet branch acquisition had a significant impact on the increase in average earning assets between and  due to the fact that the average balances in only had a six month impact on average earning assets in that year  the chief factor was the internal asset growth in itself 
from year end to year end earning assets increased million 
of that increase  million occurred within the loan portfolio  with nearly all of the increases attributable to indirect automobile loans and residential real estate loans 
during the company took advantage of its borrowing agreement with the fhlb accepting advances of million by year end 
the remaining increase in earning assets was essentially funded primarily by deposit growth 
average earning assets increased by million  or  between and however  average interest bearing liabilities increased even more  by  between the two years 
the negative impact of faster growth in interest bearing liabilities than in earning assets was exacerbated by shifts within average earning assets between the two years 
the disposition of the vermont bank in involved the sale of an operation with a relatively high loan to deposit ratio 
the acquisition of six branches from fleet bank in june  on the other hand  involved the acquisition of a relatively small percentage of loans approximately million and a relatively high level of lower yielding liquid assets approximately million in cash with the latter initially being invested in federal funds and only gradually being reinvested in higher yielding securities and loans 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  for the continuing new york operations are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for estimated loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when they are identified 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook 
the provision for loan losses was largely influenced by the level of nonperforming loans  the expected future levels of nonperforming loans  by the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance for loan losses during the year and by the change in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  a decrease of from the balance at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to one large commercial loan  placed on nonaccrual status during  which fully paid off in at december  the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses was of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or 
of average loans for the period 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or 
of average loans for the period 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of from the balance at december  the increase was primarily attributable to a large commercial loan placed on nonaccrual status during  the same loan discussed above that was fully paid off in at december  the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses was of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were million  or 
of average loans for the period 
the provision for loan losses charged to expense for was million  or 
of average loans for the period 
in addition  in mid  the company made a purchase acquisition adjustment to the allowance of thousand for loans acquired in the fleet branch transaction 
this adjustment represented the allowance for inherent risk of loss in the loans acquired 
during  loan losses charged against the allowance  net of recoveries  were thousand  or 
of average loans for the period 
however  the allowance for loan losses was significantly reduced during the year by million 
this was the amount of the reserve attributable to loans transferred in the divestiture of the vermont banking operations 
these reductions in the allowance for loan losses were offset in part by a provision for loan losses of thousand  or 
of average loans for the year 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was million 
the allowance for loan losses was of the amount of nonperforming loans at that date 
during  nonperforming assets continued the steady decline begun in the primary portion of the decrease in nonperforming assets in came from the sale of oreo out of the vermont banking operations 
nonaccrual loans increased thousand or from the year end balance 
the increase in nonaccrual loans was due primarily to the aggregate borrowing of one large commercial borrower  which was placed on nonaccrual status in that loan was accounted for under sfas no 
and was being carried at its estimated fair value 
loans reported as troubled debt restructures at december   were classified as performing in net loan losses for were million 
these losses compare to net loan losses of million for the year ended december  as a ratio to average loans  the net loan losses were 
and  for the same respective periods 
the provision for loan losses in was actually a credit to the consolidated statement of income resulting in a reduction in the allowance for loan losses 
during the second quarter of  with nonperforming assets at significantly reduced levels and a substantial sale of oreo from the company s vermont operations having been completed  the company reduced the allowance for loan losses by million 
this reduction was effected by means of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
as a result  for the twelve month period ended december   the company s net provision for loan losses was a net credit of thousand and as a ratio of average loans  the provision was

iii 
other income the majority of other ie  noninterest income is derived from fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  computer processing fees to correspondents and other core or recurring sources 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of other income 
analysis of other income dollars in thousands change december  amount percent income from fiduciary activities    fees for other services    net securities gains losses net gain on divestiture of vermont operations   other operating income   total other income     total other income increased thousand  or  from to without regard to net securities transactions and one time nonrecurring items  total other income was million for and million for  an increase of thousand  or 
for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from the increase was in large part attributable to an increase in fees from processing estates  a source of fee income which is not consistent from year to year 
at year end  trust assets under management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end  with a modest increase in the total number of accounts under administration 
fees for other services include deposit service charges  credit card merchant processing fees  safe deposit box fees and loan servicing fees 
these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase in was primarily attributable to increased deposit service charges largely traceable to the deposit accounts acquired in the fleet transaction which were only held for six months in the period and increased fee income from processing merchant credit card transactions 
other operating income includes  as a primary component  fees earned on servicing credit card portfolios for correspondent banks 
this category of noninterest income also includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned  if any  as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income  on a recurring basis  amounted to thousand  a decrease of thousand  or  from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in fees from servicing credit card portfolios for correspondent banks 
during  the company realized net securities gains of thousand on the sale of million from its available for sale portfolio 
the primary purpose of these sales was to extend the weighted average maturity of the investments in that portfolio 
for the to comparison  without regard to the million net pre tax gain on the divestiture of the vermont operations in and the impact of net securities transactions in both years  other income for decreased thousand  or  from the period 
income from fiduciary activities decreased thousand  or  from to the vermont trust business  which was sold in august  had represented approximately one half of the company s income from fiduciary activities 
the company did not acquire any trust business from fleet in the june branch acquisition 
income from the new york based trust business increased by thousand  or from to  but this was not enough to offset the decrease in trust income resulting from the vermont sale 
trust assets under management were million at december   an increase of million  or  from december  fees for other services amounted to million in  a decrease of thousand  or  from the decrease was primarily attributable to loan servicing fees related to serviced loans transferred in the disposition of vermont operations in september to a lesser extent  the decrease was attributable to the fact that the company sold deposit balances in of million  which contributed fee income for nine months in that period  and purchased million of deposit balances from fleet in june  which contributed service fee income for only six months in that year 
other operating income for amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase was primarily attributable to one time receipts in relating to an insurance settlement and unexpected payments related to the former vermont operations 
without regard to these two items  the period to period change would have been an increase of thousand  or  from  and was attributable to an increase in miscellaneous other revenues 
during  the company realized net gains of thousand on the sale of securities classified as available for sale 
proceeds from these sales amounted to million with gross gains of thousand  offset in part by gross losses of thousand 
the primary purpose of the sales was to extend the average maturity of the portfolio 
during  the company recognized net losses of thousand on the sale of million of securities classified as available for sale 
most of the sales were made for the purpose of extending the term of the securities at higher yields 
iv 
other expense other ie  noninterest expense is a means of measuring the delivery cost of services  products and business activities of the company 
the key components of other expense are presented in the following table 
analysis of other expense dollars in thousands change december  amount percent salaries and benefits      net occupancy expense    furniture and equipment    other operating expense     total other expense      other expense for amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from the most significant factor in the year to year increase was the june fleet branch acquisition  which had a full twelve month impact on but only a six month impact on upon acquisition of the fleet branches in june  the company retained all employees full time equivalent 
total full time equivalent staff at the end of was  an increase of  or  from year end the period to period increase in salary and benefit expenses also included normal salary raises 
occupancy expense increased by from to the increase  again  was primarily attributable to the acquisition of six fleet branches in june the increase in furniture and equipment expense of thousand  or  from to was affected by the branch acquisition and also by the increased depreciation expense resulting from a significant investment in software and hardware for servicing the company s and correspondent banks credit card portfolios 
other operating expense increased million  or from to this category of expense includes the amortization of goodwill associated with branch acquisitions 
the period included only six months of expense for the branches acquired from fleet in mid  whereas the period included a full year 
total goodwill amortization expense for was  an increase of thousand from the company also devoted significant resources towards establishing a marketing presence in the plattsburgh  new york area 
the company s costs to implement its year preparedness program are reported in section g of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the prior year comparison  other expense for amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from most of the decrease was in the area of employee salaries and benefits 
with the sale of the vermont operations in  the company reduced the number of its employees by full time equivalent  most of whom continued as employees of the purchasers 
upon acquisition of the fleet branches in june  the company retained all employees full time equivalent 
the net reduction in staff was primarily responsible for the million decrease in salaries and benefits  offset in part by normal salary increases 
occupancy expenses and other operating expenses decreased by and  respectively  from to the decreases  again  were primarily attributable to the fact that the decrease in expenses resulting from the sale of the vermont operations in outweighed the increase in expenses resulting from the acquisition of six fleet branches in june furniture and equipment expense increased by thousand  or  from to  primarily due to an investment in data processing equipment at the end of v 
income taxes the following table sets forth the company s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the periods presented 
income taxes and effective rates dollars in thousands years ended december  provision for income taxes    effective tax rate the provisions for federal and state income taxes amounted to million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective income tax rate from to  as well as the decrease in the effective income tax rate from to was primarily attributable to a favorable settlement with the new york state department of taxation and finance over a combined reporting issue in the first quarter of adjusting for the effects of the settlement  the effective rate for was 
as adjusted for  the decrease in the effective rate from to was primarily attributable to the implementation of certain tax planning strategies

investment portfolio investment securities are classified as held to maturity  trading  or available for sale  depending on the purposes for which such securities were acquired or are being held 
securities held to maturity are debt securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income

dividend earnings derived from equity securities were adjusted to reflect applicable federal income tax exclusions 
during  the company realized net securities gains of thousand on the sale of million from its available for sale portfolio 
the primary purpose of the sales was to extend the weighted average maturity of investments in the portfolio  by reinvesting in securities with later expected maturities 
during  the company realized net gains of thousand on the sale of securities available for sale 
proceeds from these sales amounted to million with gross gains of thousand  offset in part by gross losses of thousand 
proceeds were reinvested in available for sale securities having later maturities than the securities sold 
during  the company realized net losses of thousand on the sale of million of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
proceeds from sales early in the year were used to provide funds required in completing the sale of eight branches of the vermont bank to mascoma savings bank  a transaction in which the deposit liabilities assumed by the purchaser substantially exceeded the loans and other branch related assets acquired including the deposit premium

loan portfolio the amounts and respective percentages of loans and leases outstanding represented by each principal category on the dates indicated were as follows a 
distribution of loans and leases dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate commercial      real estate construction     real estate residential      installment loans to individuals      total loans and leases      allowance for loan losses      total loans and leases  net      compared to prior years  the company experienced a significant increase in originations for residential real estate loans during the majority of the residential loan originations represented new money mortgages  rather than the refinancing of existing loans 
the company closed nearly residential loans during the year  amounting to million of loan originations 
unlike  the increase in residential real estate loans in was primarily attributable to the acquisition of such loans incident to the purchase of the branches from fleet bank 
in  the company also continued to expand its indirect automobile lending program  which is the primary factor in the million increase in installment loans to individuals from to indirect loans are vehicle acquisition loans to consumers financed through local dealerships where  by prior arrangement  the company acquires the dealer paper 
the company also experienced an increase in consumer installment loans in with most of the increase attributable to the fleet branch acquisition and the remainder principally due to steady growth of the indirect loan program 
although the yields on the consumer portfolios other than credit card loans typically are lower than on the commercial portfolios  the company has historically experienced fewer loan losses in consumer loans than commercial loans  in proportion to outstanding average loan balances 
overall  the company experienced a slight shift during the year in the mix within the loan categories above  with a small percentage increase in residential real estate loans and installment loans to individuals and a small decrease in commercial loans 
in the fleet branch acquisition completed on june   the company acquired million of loans consumer loans million  home equity loans million  commercial loans million  commercial real estate loans million  and residential real estate loans million 
the communities served by the acquired branches have contributed to the internal loan growth experienced by the company since the closing of the branch acquisition 
during  the company transferred substantially all of the loans in its vermont banking operation in two branch sale transactions  the sale of eight branches to mascoma savings bank in january and the sale of the company s remaining six vermont branches to albank in september the vermont loan portfolio had a higher percentage of commercial loans than the loan portfolios of the company s new york banks 
consequently  the divestiture of the vermont banking operations is largely responsible for the shift in the mix of the loan portfolio from commercial to consumer loans between year end and year end this shift was augmented by the company s concentration in its new york residential real estate loans and installment loans to individuals primarily automobile loans 
the following table indicates the changing mix in the company s loan portfolio by presenting the quarterly average balances for the company s significant loan products for the past five quarters

the borrowings  which equaled million at december   were used to finance expansion in the company s loan and investment portfolios 
the borrowings were collateralized with approximately million in family residential real estate loans 
commitments and lines of credit letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business which are not reflected in the financial statements because they were not yet funded 
as of december   the total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to thousand 
in addition to these instruments  the company has issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  credit card lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   the company had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million

risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the company designates loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
upon reaching days delinquent  loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses in an amount equal to unpaid principal and accrued interest minus the fair value of collateral plus estimated costs to sell 
there were no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans and leases past due days or more and still accruing interest  as identified in the following table  are those loans and leases which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
loans classified as restructured are reported in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings  as amended by sfas no 
and the standard requires that impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over  and to all restructured loans 
reserves for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company determines impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
the company determines the interest income recognition method on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual  cash basis and cost recovery

during  nearly all of the nonaccrual loans in the vermont portfolio were transferred in connection with the sale of the vermont operations that year 
the new york based nonaccrual loans at december  were virtually unchanged from the level at the prior year end 
over one half of the nonaccrual balance at december  was attributable to one borrower whose loan was restructured in payments on that loan were current in accordance with the restructured terms as of december  and all payments in were used to reduce the carrying amount of the loan

nonperforming loans amounted to million at december   thousand below the balance at year end the increase in nonaccrual commercial loans between year end and was primarily attributable to the aggregate borrowing of one commercial borrower  which was placed on nonaccrual status during otherwise  nonaccrual loans at december  would have decreased from the prior year end balance 
all loans reported as restructured and in compliance with modified terms at december  were still in compliance with modified terms at year end and thus classified as performing at that date

potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  the company applies an internal credit quality rating system to past due commercial loans 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts 
because of its aggressive approach toward placing commercial loans on nonaccrual status  the company has not separately identified any potential problem loans in this report not included in the classifications discussed above 
the level of problem loans is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state 
in general  the economy in the company s geographic market area is quite strong 
in the capital district in and around albany  unemployment is significantly below the national average  and north of the capital district  the total number of jobs has held steady over recent periods with nominal growth in the job rate 
however  unemployment remains above the national average in the glens falls and plattsburgh areas

there are no concentrations of credit that exceed of the portfolio  other than the general categories reported in the preceding section iia of this report

summary of loan loss experience the company monitors credit quality through a continuous review of the entire loan portfolio 
all significant loans primarily commercial and commercial real estate are reviewed at least semi annually  and those under special supervision are reviewed at least quarterly 
the boards of directors of the company s subsidiary banks  upon recommendations from management  determine the extent of charge offs and have the final decision making responsibility in authorizing charge offs 
additionally  regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of the banks loan portfolios and report on these examinations to the boards of directors 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance reserve is maintained for estimated loan losses 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when they are identified 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers various risk factors influencing asset quality 
the analysis is performed on a loan by loan basis for impaired and large balance loans  and by portfolio type for smaller balance homogeneous loans 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers economic outlook 
the provision for loan losses was largely influenced by the level of nonperforming loans  the expected future levels of nonperforming loans  by the level of loans actually charged off against the allowance for loan losses during the year and by the change in the mix of loan categories within the loan portfolio 
the table in part ii  item bii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses presents a summary of the activity in the company s allowance for loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a general allowance applicable to losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for internal operating purposes  the allowance is not allocated among loan categories 
in the following table  the allowance has been allocated solely for purposes of complying with disclosure requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
however  this allocation should not be interpreted as a projection of i likely sources of future charge offs  ii likely proportional distribution of future charge offs among loan categories or iii likely amounts of future charge offs 
since management regards the allowance as a general balance and has assigned an unallocated value to the schedule  the amounts presented do not represent the total balance available to absorb future charge offs that might occur within the principal categories 
subject to the qualifications noted above  an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by principal classification and the proportion of the related loan balance is presented below as of december for each of the years indicated

on june   the company assumed million of deposit balances in the fleet branch acquisition demand million  interest bearing demand deposits million  regular and money market savings million  and other time deposits million 
these balances  accordingly  had a six month impact on average deposits for the deposit balances in the vermont branches that were sold in impacted average deposit balances for only a portion of that year

although the company did lower interest rates on its deposit products in the fourth quarter of  most of these reductions were much less than the total basis point decrease in the federal funds rate 
moreover  a significant amount of the company s pre existing time deposits have yet to reprice at the lower yields 
the company did not reduce the rates paid on deposits by the full amount of the basis point decrease in the federal funds rate both because of competitive pressures in the company s market area and because of potential consumer resistance to further reduction in already historically low rates being paid on transaction and savings accounts

liquidity liquidity is measured by the ability of the company to raise cash when it needs it at a reasonable cost 
the company must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to its customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  the company must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
securities available for sale represent a primary source of balance sheet cash flow 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
in addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows  the company has supplemented liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as credit lines with the federal home loan bank 
the company also has identified wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off balance sheet sources of funding 
the company measures its basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
understanding that excess liquidity will have a negative impact on earnings  the company establishes a target range for its liquidity ratios 
at december   the company was operating within those thresholds

capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end 
the increase in shareholders equity during primarily reflected retained earnings offset by the purchase of treasury shares throughout the year 
on january   the board of directors announced that it had authorized management to repurchase from time to time  in market or privately negotiated transactions  up to an additional million of the company s common stock  representing approximately of its total market capitalization on that date 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
the company s principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to the company and the subsidiary banks are so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for the company  tier capital is comprised of shareholders equity less intangible assets 
total capital includes tier capital plus a portion of the company s allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of the company and its subsidiary banks as of december  risk based capital ratios arrow gfnb snb tier total capital tier leverage ratio at december   both subsidiary banks and the company exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by these guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to fdicia see the disclosure under legislative developments in part i  item f of this report

year readiness disclosure year readiness general the advent of the year poses certain technological challenges resulting from a reliance in computer technologies on two digits rather than four digits to represent the calendar year eg  for 
computer technologies programmed in this manner  if not corrected  could produce inaccurate or unpredictable results or system failures in connection with the transition from to  when dates will begin to have a lower two digit number than dates in the prior century 
this problem  the so called year problem or yk problem  may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  business or business prospects because the company  like most financial institutions  relies extensively on computer technology to manage its financial information and serve its customers 
the company and its banking subsidiaries are regulated by federal banking agencies  which are requiring substantial efforts by banks and their affiliated companies to prevent or mitigate disruptions relating to the year the company s state of readiness to deal with the year problem  the company  beginning in  formed a year project team the team 
the team  which includes members of senior management  has developed a year action plan the plan  specifying a range of tasks and goals to be achieved at various dates before the year to date  the plan is on target and major deadlines have been met 
the team has kept other senior officers and the board of directors of the company apprised of its progress  and has received input and guidance from both 
the company s year action plan is divided into five phases consistent with guidance issued by the federal bank regulators awareness  assessment  renovation  validation testing  and implementation 
as of december   the company had completed the awareness  assessment and renovation phases of the plan  and had partially completed the validation phase 
the first two of these phases involved  among other things  identification of those data systems  including information technology it and non information technology non it systems  that are deemed critical to the continuing functioning of the company s principal business operations so called mission critical systems 
the renovation phase of the plan consists of replacing or updating certain mission critical systems or components thereof with a view to preventing or minimizing any yk related problems 
the renovation phase for all internal mission critical systems was completed prior to year end as part of the renovation phase  the company accelerated  and has now completed  the installation of a major upgrade to its central computer processing system  which had originally been scheduled for implementation in acceleration of the upgrade has enabled the company to conduct certain year testing in house  which otherwise would have to have been conducted by a third party provider at additional expense to the company 
as of december   the company had completed the validation testing phase of the plan with respect to those mission critical systems that are operated by the company internally 
moreover  the validation testing phase with respect to mission critical systems furnished to the company by third party providers was underway as of december   and is scheduled to be completed prior to march  the implementation phase  involving all modifications to systems indicated by the testing phase as well as on going monitoring of yk concerns generally  is on going and the company anticipates it will continue throughout during all phases of the plan  the year project team has actively monitored the yk preparedness of its third party providers and servicers  utilizing various methods for testing and verification 
the company has requested certifications of year preparedness from principal providers and has participated in user groups 
the company also has completed an assessment of major borrowing accounts and has assigned a risk rating to each based on information obtained from the borrower 
year preparedness assessment is now a part of on going loan account review 
the company also has contacted and reviewed the state of yk preparedness of the company s principal sources of liquidity 
the company believes that there is no single credit account or source of funding that is sufficiently critical to the company s profitability or operations such that yk preparedness or lack thereof represents a material exposure to the company see year risks facing the company and the company s contingency plans  below 
the company has not yet engaged in discussions with its utility providers eg  electricity  gas  telecommunications regarding yk concerns 
as part of the plan  however  the company will continue to monitor yk disclosures by all such providers to the businesses and financial organizations  such as the company that rely on them 
the company will also continue to monitor such disclosures by the governmental agencies upon which the company relies for certain services eg  the federal reserve system  the federal home loan bank of new york 
in accordance with its plan  the company will make particular inquiries of such providers and agencies when circumstances warrant  and will generally strive for a yk preparedness against industry wide and geographic yk systemic risks comparable to that maintained by similarly situated organizations exercising appropriate due care 
of course  any industry wide or regional disruptions arising out of the yk problem may be expected to affect the company and its customers 
the significance of any such disruption will depend on its duration and its systemic and geographic magnitude see year risks facing the company and the company s contingency plans 
the following table sets forth the company s timetable for completion of the various phases of its year action plan  showing the company s estimate of percentages of each phase completed as of december  internal system external systems third parites not not percent mission critical mission critical mission critical mission critical loan funds complete it nonit it nonit it nonit it nonit customers providers awareness assessment renovation n a n a validation n a n a n a n a implementation external non it systems are generally described as product vendors 
the costs to address the company s year issues the company originally projected yk expenditures of between thousand and thousand 
yk expenditures through december   were approximately thousand  of which represented the cost of the accelerated upgrading of the company s central computer processing systems which was substantially complete as of that date 
the projection of the company s yk costs does not include internal personnel costs  which are not expected to be significantly greater as a result of the year problem  or external consulting or advisory fees  which have been and are expected to be minimal 
the company s budget for yk expenditures consists predominantly of expenditures for the upgrading or replacement of hardware and software systems  divided approximately for hardware and for software 
the company has funded  and plans to fund  its year related expenditures out of general operating resources 
the company has postponed certain minor computer related projects that otherwise might have been completed during and  due to the resources directed to the accelerated upgrading of the central computer processing systems and other yk related projects 
the company does not believe this postponement will have any significant effect on its operations or customer service 
year risks facing the company and the company s contingency plans the failure of the company to complete all material aspects of its plan or to complete them on time could result in an interruption in or failure of certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
currently  the plan is on schedule and management believes that successful completion of the plan should significantly reduce the risks faced by the company with respect to the year problem 
there is no single credit account or group of related credits which  in the company s assessment  is or may be likely to present any significant exposure due to the year problem 
the company does not have any significant concentration of borrowers from any particular industry to the extent some industries might be particularly susceptible to yk concerns  and no individual borrower accounts for a significant portion of the company s assets 
however  management anticipates some negative impact on the performance of various loan accounts due to failure of the borrowers to prepare adequately for the year problem 
in a worst case scenario  these borrower related difficulties might require the company to downgrade the affected credits in its internal loan classification system or to make one or more special provisions to its loan loss allowance for resulting anticipated losses in ensuing periods 
in addition  although the company is adopting special measures to maintain necessary liquidity to meet funding demands in the periods surrounding the transition from to  the company also could face increased funding costs or liquidity pressures if depositors are motivated out of yk concerns to withdraw substantial amounts of deposits or to shift their deposits from short term to long term accounts 
a significant portion of the company s deposits are so called municipal deposits ie  provided by local municipalities  school districts and other governmental bodies  but the company does not anticipate any increased year related risk due to this concentration of deposits 
the company does not currently expect any material impact from yk related issues on its costs of funds or liquidity  but in a worst case scenario  if funding costs do rise  net interest margins may be negatively impacted over the relevant time frame 
the company could face some risk from the possible failure of one or more of its third party vendors to continue to provide uninterrupted service through the changeover to the year critical providers include the company s automated teller machine switching networks  the company s credit card vendors visa and mastercard  the company s provider of trust department data processing  and the various credit bureaus upon which the company relies for information necessary to evaluate credit risk 
while an evaluation of the year preparedness of its third party vendors has been part of the company s plan  the company s ability to evaluate is limited to some extent by the willingness of vendors to supply information and the inability of some vendors to verify with any high degree of reliability the yk preparedness of their own systems or their sub providers 
however  the company participates in user groups that include some of its third party vendors  and receives assessments of yk preparedness of vendors periodically from federal banking agencies 
the company s plan also includes protocols for interface testing with third party vendors systems 
in summary  the company does not currently anticipate that its significant third party vendors will experience material failures in their ability to provide continuing service to the company due to the year problem 
the company  like similarly situated enterprises  is subject to certain risks as a result of possible industry wide or area wide failures triggered by the year problem 
for example  the failure of certain utility providers eg  electricity  gas  telecommunications or governmental agencies eg  the federal reserve system  the federal home loan bank of new york to avoid disruption of service in connection with the transition from to could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
in management s estimate  such a system wide or area wide failure presents a significant risk to the company in connection with the year problem because the resulting disruption may be entirely beyond the ability of the company to cure 
the significance of any such disruption would depend on its duration and systemic and geographic magnitude 
of course  any such disruption would likely impact businesses other than the company 
in order to reduce the risks enumerated above  the company s year project team has begun to develop contingency plans in accordance with guidance issued by the federal bank regulators 
the team has identified the company s core business processes eg  providing customers with access to funds and information and has reviewed the company s existing business continuity and contingency plans 
the team also has performed a risk analysis of each core business process  defined and documented year failure scenarios  and determined the minimum acceptable level of outputs and services 
the team is in the process of finalizing an overall contingency strategy with specific contingency plans for each core business process  assigning responsibilities and trigger dates for each contingency plan  and validating the plans 
these activities are anticipated to be completed during the first quarter of certain catastrophic events such as the protracted loss of essential utilities or the failure of certain governmental bodies to function are outside the scope of the company s contingency plans  although the company anticipates that it would respond to any such catastrophe in a manner designed to minimize disruptions in customer service and in full cooperation with its peer providers  community leaders and service organizations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in the company s loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  the company s business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make the company s position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to prepayment risks for mortgage related assets  early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest bearing assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates  where interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at their earliest possible repricing date 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
as of december  under this analysis  a basis point increase in interest rates resulted in a decrease in net interest income and a basis point decrease in interest rates resulted in a increase in net interest income 
these amounts were well within the company s alco policy limits 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
