item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations operating income increased to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal and  in fiscal  representing increases of and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in operating income in fiscal was attributable to significantly improved financial performance by the company s larger  more seasoned companies  while the company s newer and smaller distribution operations generally showed less or no improvement in financial results from prior years 
the increase in operating income in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was a result of earnings from contractors heating supply chs  which the company acquired in september fiscal operating income at businesses owned by the company from the beginning of fiscal was equal to or less than fiscal operating income  as unusually moderate and wet weather conditions during the spring and early summer of reduced demand for air conditioning products in the company s key markets 
net income was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
higher interest costs relating to the company s acquisitions significantly impacted net income in fiscal and reductions in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased net income by  in fiscal and  in fiscal sales have increased annually  reaching million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal same store sales increased  and in fiscal  and  respectively  with each year significantly exceeding the industry average 
the slower rate of growth in fiscal was due to unfavorable weather conditions and a post olympic building slowdown in georgia 
through fiscal  the majority of the company s sales growth had resulted from internal expansion of branch operations rather than from acquisitions  but in fiscal and  respectively  and of the increase in sales was attributable to operations acquired since january in comparison  acquisitions accounted for of the growth in sales from fiscal to fiscal the company s gross margin percentage increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal and in fiscal the continual increase in gross margin percentage from fiscal is a result of management s effort to focus the company on starting up and acquiring businesses that are expected to enhance the company s gross margin percentage 
in particular  chs manufactures products that account for approximately of its sales revenue and  accordingly  achieves a higher gross margin percentage than if it purchased all of its inventory from outside suppliers 
the company s gross margin percentage has also been favorably affected by purchasing arrangements that management has negotiated from its major suppliers  and by technology improvements that have enabled management to implement more sophisticated pricing strategies 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs as a percentage of sales were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase from fiscal is due in part to the sg a percentage at the company s manufacturing operations  which are generally expected to incur higher sg a costs as a percentage of sales than the company s distribution operations 
in addition  the company s distribution business in california  which was acquired in  has higher overhead costs than would ordinarily be expected  as the company has staffed this operation to support a substantial growth rate over the next several years 
in fiscal  the company also recorded  more bad debt expense than in fiscal  which was largely attributable to the unexpected business failure of a single customer with respect to which the company wrote off  of accounts receivable 
in fiscal  the company recorded a non recurring charge of  for performance based compensation pursuant to the employment contract of its chief executive officer 
beginning in fiscal  the company earned commission revenue from a supplier by providing warehousing and shipping services to another distributor of the supplier 
in calendar  the supplier reduced the commission rate applicable to this arrangement  and  at the end of  the arrangement was discontinued 
revenues from this source were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
net energy services income declined from fiscal to fiscal  after increasing in fiscal from fiscal the company continues to provide a reduced level of services on a month to month basis to its remaining customer  following the expiration of its energy services contract in management does not expect to negotiate another contract with the customer and cannot estimate how long such an informal arrangement may continue 
interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and in fiscal compared to as a result of the company s increased borrowings 
in  and  interest expense was  and of sales  respectively 
the increase in interest expense after fiscal was attributable to indebtedness incurred in connection with the company s acquisitions 
other non operating income increased from fiscal to fiscal  and from fiscal to fiscal  as the company has more strictly enforced its policy to collect finance charges from customers with past due balances 
current income tax expense consists principally of state income taxes and federal alternative minimum taxes 
as a result of the company s substantial tax loss carryforwards  the company has minimal liability for federal income taxes 
see liquidity and capital resources  below 
in both fiscal and  the company determined that further reductions in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance were appropriate given expectations of higher future taxable income from recently acquired subsidiaries and  as a result  recorded additional tax benefits of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased from million at february  to million at february   principally as a result of the company s earnings through sales growth 
accounts receivable represented days of gross sales at the end of both fiscal and of the million increase in inventory  
million was located at operations acquired or started up in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and 
million consisted of a new line of hvac equipment that the company s california operations began distributing in fiscal the company has credit facilities with a commercial bank bank which include an million revolving line of credit and a  term loan facility for the purchase of capital equipment 
at february   the company had available credit of  and  under the revolving credit line and the term loan facility  respectively 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by accounts receivable and inventory  and the permitted amount of outstanding borrowings at any time is limited to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory amounts 
borrowings under the facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either the bank s prime rate plus or libor plus  payable monthly 
restrictive covenants of the loan agreement prohibit the company from paying dividends  prepaying any subordinated indebtedness or incurring certain other debt without the bank s consent  and also require the company to maintain certain financial ratios see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the revolving credit line and the term loan facilities mature in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
a schedule of declining prepayment penalties applies in the event that the line of credit facility is paid prior to maturity 
in connection with an acquisition in fiscal  the company issued a note to the seller for  which is subordinated to the bank 
such debt is payable over a term of three years and bears interest at per annum 
the company made capital expenditures of  in fiscal for leasehold improvements  computer software  equipment  and the addition and replacement of vehicles under capital leases 
at february   the company had placed orders for new production machinery for its manufacturing operations with an aggregate cost of approximately  the company has approximately million in tax loss carryforwards and million in tax credit carryforwards 
such operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will substantially limit the company s federal income tax liabilities in the near future 
certain provisions of the internal revenue code code regulate the amount of additional stock that the company could issue without resulting in a change in ownership control  as defined in the code 
should such a change in control be deemed to occur  the company s ability to utilize its operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be severely restricted 
the company expects that cash flows from operations and the borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its normal operating requirements  existing debt service and expected capital expenditures 
subject to limitations set forth in its loan agreement with the bank  funds available under the company s revolving credit facility may also be utilized to finance acquisitions 
although management has engaged in discussions with several potential lenders or investors  the company has no commitment for additional financing and cannot predict whether or when any such additional financing may materialize 
management is also reviewing the suitability of several acquisition opportunities  but has not entered into definitive agreements to acquire any companies 
the company s ability to consummate a significant acquisition may be dependent upon obtaining additional financing 
seasonality the company s sales volume and  accordingly  its operating income vary significantly during its fiscal year 
the highest levels of sales occur during the times of the year when climatic conditions require the greatest use of air conditioning  since the company s operations are concentrated in the warmer regions of the united states 
accordingly  sales will be highest in the company s second quarter ending august  and will be lowest in its fourth fiscal quarter 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
generally  manufacturer price increases attributable to inflation uniformly affect both the company and its competitors  and such increases are passed through to customers as an increase in sales prices 
year issue the company has addressed its state of readiness to deal with the problem commonly known as the year issue 
with respect to its own information systems  the company has installed an upgrade to its existing integrated application software such that the software is now fully year compliant 
one of the company s subsidiaries does not utilize the company s integrated software and has substantially completed testing for modifications to its computer programs that will accommodate year such modifications were accomplished by staff of the company 
the company does not believe that it has a material exposure to year issues in elements of its own operations other than its information systems  but management is continually updating its assessment of such elements 
the costs incurred by the company to date to achieve year compliance have been less than  and have been expensed as incurred  and the company does not expect to incur material future costs in connection with its ongoing efforts 
the company has informally discussed year preparedness with its most significant suppliers and has obtained assurances that such suppliers do not expect any disruption in their ability to fulfill customer orders as a result of year issues 
to date  the company has not undertaken an assessment of the year preparedness of its customers 
the company does not have any interconnectivity with its customers computer systems  and no customer represents more than of consolidated sales 
management may initiate discussions during with its most significant customers concerning their year preparedness  but does not believe that customers lack of preparedness would have a material adverse effect on the company s sales or results of operations 
the company has not developed a specific contingency plan to address a worst case scenario dealing with lack of year preparedness 
although management is confident that the company s own internal systems will be fully year compliant  the company s branch operations would be able to conduct business using manual systems for an indefinite period of time if the company s automated information systems were unexpectedly disabled 
management believes that a year contingency plan would principally address issues relating to the potential inability of suppliers  service providers or customers to satisfactorily address their own year issues 
the company expects to continually assess the year preparedness of such parties and  if circumstances dictate  may undertake specific contingency plans 
while management believes that it has taken adequate steps to address the year issue  there can be no assurance that the inability of either significant business partners or key parties that provide the country s business and public service infrastructure to adequately address the year issue would not have a material adverse impact on the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on its senior credit facility  which includes revolving credit and term notes 
these instruments carry interest at a pre agreed upon percentage point spread from either the prime interest rate or libor 
under its senior credit facility the company may  at its option  fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over libor for days to months 
at february  the company had million outstanding under its senior credit facility 
based on this balance  an immediate change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately  or 
per diluted share  on an annual basis 
the company s objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings
