overview the st 
joe company is a diversified company engaged in the real estate  forestry  transportation  and leisure and resort industries 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began treating its sugar operations as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes 
until the second quarter of  the company was also engaged in communications and the manufacture and distribution of paper products 
the company s assets and operations are concentrated in the state of florida 
consequently  the company s performance  and particularly that of its real estate operations  is significantly affected by the general health of the florida economy 
the company s businesses  particularly the forestry and transportation segments  are also influenced by the general health of the national economy 
the company s real estate operations are cyclical and are affected by local demographic and general economic trends and the supply and rate of absorption of new construction 
although the company has a large portfolio of income producing properties that provide stable operating results  the company s earnings from period to period may be significantly affected by the nature and timing of sales of development property and non strategic assets 
the company recently underwent a number of important changes in the mix of its businesses and its overall business strategy 
in the first quarter of  the company hired a new chairman and chief executive officer as well as several other senior members of management with strong backgrounds in large scale real estate planning and development 
under the direction of this new management team  the company is focusing more closely on the development of its large land portfolio 
management believes that the company s increased focus on real estate operations will result in a larger portion of the company s overall revenues being attributable to real estate operations 
however  many of the company s proposed projects will require a lengthy process to complete the development cycle before they are sold or otherwise generate revenue 
nevertheless  management believes the company s existing raw land portfolio will allow the company to maintain relatively low development costs and that its existing large portfolio of income producing properties  together with its other businesses  will continue to generate cash to fund a significant portion of its longer term projects 
recent events consistent with the company s plans to extract value from its non strategic assets  in march  the company announced its intentions to sell approximately  acres of its timberlands and an auction process is expected to begin in to sell the first  acres 
the sale of additional parcels  expected to be  acres each  will be grouped  sized and timed in order to seek maximum value 
a study commissioned by the company has identified these timberlands as having little real estate development potential in the next to years 
no assurance can be given that any of the property can be sold at an acceptable price within an acceptable time period 
on december   the company signed an agreement in principle with the united states of america and the state of florida the governments  under which the governments agreed to purchase substantially all of the sugar lands that the company owns or leases for million in cash 
talisman retained the right to farm the land through the crop year 
in december  that sale was closed in escrow pending the resolution of a lawsuit filed in federal district court in washington  dc seeking to invalidate the sale 
on march  talisman entered into an exchange agreement the exchange agreement with the south florida water management district  united states sugar corporation  okeelanta corporation  south florida industries  inc  florida crystals corporation  sugar cane growers cooperative of florida collectively the sugar companies  the united states department of interior  and the nature conservancy 
the agreement allows talisman to exit the sugar business 
talisman assigned its right to farm the land to the sugar companies 
in return  the lawsuit was dismissed and the other parties agreed to pay talisman million 
talisman retains ownership of the sugar mill and is presently evaluating the best manner to dispose of the mill 
talisman is responsible for the cleanup of the mill site 
talisman is obligated to complete certain defined environmental remediation the remediation 
approximately million of the purchase price will be held in escrow pending the completion of the remediation 
talisman must use its funds to pay the costs of the remediation 
based upon the current environmental studies 
talisman does not believe the costs of the remediation will exceed the amount held in escrow 
talisman will receive the fund when all the remediation is complete 
in the event other environmental matters are discovered  the sugar companies will be responsible for the first 
million of the cleanup 
talisman will be responsible for the next million  thereafter the parties shall share the costs equally 
in addition  approximately million is being held in escrow  representing the value of the land subject to the remediation 
as talisman completes the cleanup of a particular parcel  an amount equal to the land value on that parcel will be released from escrow 
the estimated gain on the combined sale of the land and harvesting rights is expected to be between million to million  after tax unaudited  subject to finalization of reserves and other adjustments
