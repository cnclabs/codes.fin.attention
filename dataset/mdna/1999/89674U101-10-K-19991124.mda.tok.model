inflation during fiscal year ended  and consistent with the company s and fiscal years  inflation did not have a material adverse impact either on the company s net sales or income from continuing operations 
the company does not expect inflation to have a material adverse impact in fiscal year factors affecting the company s business  operating results and financial condition the results for fiscal could be adversely affected by each or all of the following factors latin america economies 
the market for the company s products continues to be negatively impacted as a result of devaluation and economic and political instability 
these factors sharply reduced the purchasing power of the latin america consumer  and therefore  the demand for the company s products was adversely affected 
any future significant deterioration of these economies would adversely affect the company s sales in latin america and also the collectability of accounts receivable 
mexican market 
growth in sales  or even the maintenance of existing sales levels  in mexico  depends to a large extent on the economic health and political stability of that country 
any deterioration in the economic or political stability could adversely affect sales 
although the company has no such knowledge  some of its customers based in the united states may sell the company s products as well as the products of other companies to purchasers who  in turn  may attempt to import goods into mexico without full payment of applicable mexican taxes and customs duties 
enhanced enforcement efforts by mexican authorities  should they arise  may have an adverse effect on the company s sales to such customers 
supply of products 
the company s ability to manufacture and to satisfy consumer demand for fragrances is dependent on the supply of certain components from single sources including an affiliate of the sheth group 
any inability of these vendors to meet the company s requirements could have an adverse effect on the company s results until an alternative source could be found and or developed 
in addition  the company is dependent on the supply of cosmetic products  other than cosmetic pencils  from sheth group affiliates 
if such affiliates were to cease or be unable to supply these cosmetic products  the lack of these products would have an adverse effect on the company until a secondary supplier could be located 
new and developing markets 
the company continues to pursue sales expansion in the us  canada  and latin america markets 
in the process  the company incurs certain expenses in order to establish a marketing presence and an economically viable amount of sales 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in those endeavors or that it will recover its initial expenses and start up costs 
in addition  certain countries from time to time impose strict import restrictions  high levels of taxes on imports  and restrictions on currency transactions  all of which could affect the success of sales and marketing activities and also affect the profitability of such activities 
at this time  it is not known whether  or to what degree  the above factors will have a material adverse impact on future results 
year compliance as a result of certain computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year  any of the company s computer programs that have a date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions and engage in normal business activities 
as part of the company s year readiness program yk plan  management has evaluated its programs and systems 
the company s yk plan s focus is on assessing and assuring compliance in the following areas hardware  operating systems  legacy applications and data  external linkages and non information systems areas 
tristar s operating systems are centered around hewlett packard unix  microsoft nt and windows the company operates these systems under licenses and maintenance agreements which provide for software upgrades to remedy the year compliance issues 
the principal legacy applications consist of manufacturing total management system mtms which is licensed from bridge logix who has provided yk compliant software 
this software has undergone six weeks of rigorous tests in a stand alone environment and began operational use on november  hardware compliance testing has been completed 
certain computer and equipment with non compliant code and real time clocks have been identified and have either been replaced or will be upgraded 
certain non critical hardware will be manually reset on january  two key phone switches  voice mail systems  time clocks  and networking equipment have been upgraded and or certified yk compliant 
manufacturing facilities have been closely examined and no yk remediation has been necessary 
the company conducts electronic data interchange edi with its trading partners using yk compliant standards 
yk readiness certifications have been received from these trading partners in addition to certifications from key vendors  customers  service suppliers  phone  electric  and water utilities 
the company has allocated human resources as appropriate within its information systems group to coordinate the activities to obtain compliance 
to date  has been spent on yk remediation  primarily for software and professional services 
another  is expected to be required by year s end to replace obsolete laptops and workstations 
while the company has completed testing and expects to be fully yk ready by the end of november  contingency plans are in development to address potential external supply chain disruptions as well as internal yk related failures which may have been overlooked 
these contingencies include  but are not limited to  stockpiling raw materials  identifying alternative sources of goods and services  alternate manufacturing processes  production of manual inventory and work order reports  and work stoppages 
in the event contingency plans must be deployed  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of a magnitude which the company presently is unable to predict 
the above year disclosure constitutes a year readiness disclosure as defined in the year information and readiness disclosure act the act  which was signed into law on october  the act provides added protection from liability for certain public and private statements concerning a company s year readiness 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may occur due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk  and the effect they may have on the financial position  results of operation or cash flow of the company 
the company s short term and long term debt at august  bears interest at variable rates see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
a one percentage point increase in the effective interest rate would result in an approximate  and  for and  respectively  reduction in annual pretax earnings 
this estimate assumes no change in the volume or composition of the short term and long term debt as of august  as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company s direct exports comprise approximately of net sales for the fiscal year ended august  in addition  certain us based customers ultimately distribute the company s products into foreign countries 
as a result  the company has exposure to risk associated with the decrease in value of foreign currencies 
although the risk cannot be quantified  any significant decrease in value of the currency of foreign countries where the company s products are distributed could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales and results of operations
