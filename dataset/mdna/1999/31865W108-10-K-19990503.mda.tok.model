the company believes that its cash flow from operations  combined with borrowings available under its existing and new lines of credit  will be sufficient to meet its current and anticipated cash operating requirements  including scheduled interest and principal payments  capital expenditures  preferred dividend requirements and working capital needs through the end of the fiscal year ending january  the company currently is in compliance with all of its debt covenants 
year the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s computerized information systems 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs and systems that have time sensitive software may be unable to interpret dates beyond the year this could result in miscalculations and or system failures  causing disruptions of operations controlled by such systems or devices 
the company and each of its operating subsidiaries have conducted comprehensive reviews of their systems and have developed plans to address any possible issues related to the impact of the year problem on both information technology it and non it systems eg  embedded technology 
these plans address the year issue in multiple phases  including i determining an initial inventory of the company s systems  equipment  vendors  customers and third party administrators that may be vulnerable to system failures or processing errors as a result of year issues  ii assessing and prioritizing of inventoried items to determine risks associated with their failure to be year compliant  iii testing of systems and equipment to determine year compliance  and iv remediating and implementing systems and equipment 
for those systems which the company determines are not currently year compliant  implementation of the required changes is expected to be completed during the next fiscal year 
as of january  all critical hardware and software systems utilized by the company had been tested and or verified as either year compliant or appropriate remediation was taken or will be taken to effect compliance 
certain non critical software systems were determined not to be year compliant and had been or will be modified or converted to compliant systems 
conversion of additional non critical systems is in process 
testing systems utilized to verify compliance include the posting to the systems of a date on or after january  as though the date were effective 
the company has tested nearly all of its critical it and non it systems 
any necessary additional modifications or replacements are scheduled to be completed during the first three quarters of fiscal year the company is in the process of contacting its major suppliers and vendors to assess their status relating to year readiness and or compliance  and the potential impact on operations if such third parties are not successful in ensuring that their systems are year compliant in a timely manner 
the company could suffer potential business interruptions and or incur costs  damages or losses related thereto if other third parties  such as governmental agencies eg  federal aviation administration  are not year compliant 
the company is unable to determine at this time whether it will be materially affected by the failure of any of its suppliers  vendors or other third parties to be year compliant 
a failure by the company  its major suppliers or vendors  or any third party with which the company interacts  to resolve a material year issue could result in the interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations and could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company is currently assessing those scenarios in which unexpected failures could have a material adverse effect on the company and anticipates that it will develop contingency plans  as deemed appropriate  designed to deal with such scenarios 
based on current plans and assumptions  the company does not expect that the year issue will have a material adverse impact on the company as a whole 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  however  there can be no assurance that all year issues will be foreseen and corrected on a timely basis  or that no material disruption to the company s business operations will occur 
further  the company s expectations are based on the assumption that there will be no general failure of external local  national or international systems including power  communications  postal  transportation  or financial systems necessary for the ordinary conduct of business 
costs associated with the company s year compliance effort  including consulting costs and costs associated with internal resources used to modify existing systems in order to achieve year compliance  are charged to expense as incurred 
management estimates that the expenditures relating to the company s year compliance effort will total approximately  through january  management estimates that approximately  has been spend addressing this issue 
the remainder is expected to be spent over the next two to three quarters 
the company does not separately track internal costs of the year compliance effort 
the anticipated costs of the project and the dates on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications and assessments are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant systems 
management does not expect the financial impact of making the required system changes to be material to the company s overall consolidated financial position 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate levels of inflation which have been experienced in the united states has had or will have a significant effect on its revenues or operations

risk relating to receivables arising from export sales is limited through the use of letters of credit or with the purchase of foreign credit insurance
