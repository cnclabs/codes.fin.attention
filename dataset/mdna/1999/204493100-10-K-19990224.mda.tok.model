overview compaq s completion of recent acquisitions has resulted in an expanded and enhanced business model  focused on open industry standard products  leadership enterprise technology and solutions and a full line of global service offerings 
as the second largest computing company in the world and the largest global supplier of computer systems  compaq delivers customer value through standards based  partner leveraged computing that features services  support and market segment focused solutions  particularly in communications  manufacturing and finance 
compaq is a strategic information technology partner to customers of all sizes  providing product offerings that range from handheld devices to powerful failsafe computers 
the year was transitional for compaq 
during the first half of the year  the company accelerated the implementation of the optimized distribution model towards the goal of moving from a build to stock operating model to a build to order configure to order model 
during the second half of the year compaq undertook a major integration effort following the acquisition of digital in june these integration efforts included product migration strategies  sales force integration  service organization integration  consolidation of duplicative facilities  employee separations and relocations  and the integration of the internal information systems of the combined companies 
the company recorded several charges in connection with the digital acquisition and closing of certain compaq facilities see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these charges included approximately billion for the write off of purchased in process technology and million for restructuring and asset impairment charges related to compaq employee separations and elimination of certain compaq facilities 
revenue revenue for increased approximately billion or over the prior year as compared with an increase of billion or during the increase in revenue was largely driven by the acquisition of digital 
the increase in revenue was driven primarily by internal growth 
products revenue for increased approximately billion or over the prior year as compared with an increase of billion or during products revenue in reflected a growth in worldwide unit sales of  compared to in growth in options revenue was in compared to in the increase in was primarily the result of the digital acquisition and strong growth in the consumer business 
offsetting this growth was the expected short term reduction in revenues relating to the impact of significant pricing and promotional actions taken in conjunction with the company s transition to the optimized distribution model  the implementation of product migration strategies for intel based  digital branded personal computers  and the realignment of the sales and marketing organizations of the newly combined companies throughout the world 
products revenue for north america in grew million or over the prior year as compared with an increase of billion or during products revenue in north america represented  and of total products revenue in  and  respectively 
products revenue growth in related to the acquisition of digital and strong year over year growth in the consumer business  partially offset by a decline in commercial products revenue 
the decline in commercial products revenue related to the aggressive price reductions and promotional activities implemented primarily in north america in the first half of due to the transition to the optimized distribution model  lower than expected sales out of the channel  and to respond to competitive pricing conditions 
the third and fourth quarter revenues were negatively impacted by the implementation of product migration strategies and the realignment of the sales and marketing organizations as described above 
products revenue growth in related to strong year over year growth in both the commercial and consumer markets  with the most significant commercial product growth relating to enterprise products  most notably servers and workstations 
products revenue for europe  middle east and africa emea in grew billion or over the prior year as compared with an increase of billion or during products revenue in emea represented  and of total products revenue in  and  respectively 
products revenue growth in emea in was the result of both the acquisition of digital and strong year over year growth in consumer and commercial products revenue  partially offset by more competitive pricing 
products revenue in reflected an overall improvement in market share and strong year over year revenue growth in each of the product areas  the most significant of which related to enterprise products 
services revenue for increased approximately billion over the prior year as compared with an increase of million during services revenue growth for was almost entirely due to the acquisition of digital 
with the acquisition of digital  compaq now has a world class services organization with market focused solutions and high availability support  particularly in the communications  manufacturing and finance industries 
services revenue for and related primarily to professional services provided by tandem 
services revenue for north america in grew billion over the prior year as compared with an increase of million during services revenue in north america represented  and of total services revenue in  and  respectively 
services revenue for emea in grew billion over the prior year as compared with an increase of million during services revenue in emea represented   and of total services revenue in  and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in  down from in and in products gross margin as a percentage of products revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in resulted largely from significant pricing and promotional actions taken by compaq primarily in the north american market during the first and second quarters of to meet the goals of the company s optimized distribution model and to respond to competitive pricing conditions 
gross margins improved during the third and fourth quarters  partially offset by the impacts of the implementation of product migration strategies and the realignment of the sales and marketing operations 
the increase in gross margins in primarily resulted from a higher proportion of sales of enterprise products and options  production and logistics cost savings  and overall asset management improvements 
products gross margin as a percentage of products revenue in north america was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in products gross margin resulted largely from the significant pricing  promotional and other actions taken by compaq as noted above 
products gross margin as a percentage of products revenue in emea was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in emea products gross margin was primarily related to the digital product integration 
services gross margin as a percentage of services revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in services gross margin in is primarily attributable to the acquisition of digital 
operating expenses research and development costs increased million or in as compared to  primarily due to the acquisition of digital 
research and development costs increased million or in as compared to compaq is committed to maintaining a significant level of research and development investment in support of its activities as a full service enterprise computing company  offering leadership technologies and products for the future 
in addition  compaq spent approximately billion in and million in on purchased in process technology in connection with the digital and microcom acquisitions 
compaq s selling  general and administrative expense increased billion or in as compared to  primarily due to the acquisition of digital 
compaq s selling  general and administrative expense increased million or in as compared to as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense was  and in  and  respectively  and in absolute dollars was billion  billion  and billion in  and  respectively 
the increase as a percentage of revenue and absolute dollars in over is primarily due to the acquisition of digital and the support of significant new product introductions  expansion into new markets and increases in our investment in services 
in the fourth quarter of  operating expenses as a percentage of revenue began to decline due to implementation of the restructuring plans and the realization of synergies for the combined companies 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue in reflected efforts to manage operating expense growth relative to revenue and gross margin levels 
the increase in the amount of expense resulted from domestic and international selling expense associated with higher unit volumes as well as expense incurred in connection with the introduction of new products  the entry into new markets  the expansion of distribution channels and a greater emphasis on customer service and technical support 
purchased in process technology upon consummation of the digital acquisition in june  compaq immediately expensed approximately billion representing purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate includes a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on compaq management s estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes from such projects 
these estimates were based on the following assumptions the estimated revenues projected average compounded annual revenue growth rates of to during  depending on the product areas 
for instance  unix openvms compounded annual growth rates were and storage rates were 
estimated total revenue from the purchased in process product areas were expected to peak in the year and decline rapidly in as other new products were expected to enter the market 
these projections were based on compaq management s estimates of market size and growth supported by independent market data  expected trends in technology such as new families of products in the external storage product area and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by digital and its competitors 
these estimates also included growth estimates related to compaq utilizing certain digital technologies in conjunction with compaq s products  compaq s marketing and distribution of the resulting products through compaq s resellers and compaq s enhancing the market s response to digital s products by providing incremental financial support and stability 
the estimated cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was expected to be lower than digital s on a stand alone basis in digital s fiscal  primarily due to compaq s expected ability to achieve more favorable pricing from key component vendors and production efficiencies due to economies of scale through combined operations 
as a result of these savings  the estimated cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was expected to decrease by to from digital s historical percentage  depending on the product areas 
the combined company was expected to benefit from more favorable pricing from key component vendors and production efficiencies due to economies of scale 
as a result of these savings  the estimated cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the unix openvms and storage markets  the two most significant product areas of purchased in process technology  were expected to decrease up to from digital s historical percentages 
the estimated selling  general and administrative costs were expected to more closely approximate compaq s cost structure approximately of revenues in  which was lower than digital s cost structure approximately of revenues in digital s fiscal 
cost savings were expected to result primarily from the changes related to the restructuring actions discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as savings resulting from the distribution of digital s products through compaq s resellers ie  sales of higher volume products with lower direct selling costs and efficiencies due to economies of scale through combined operations ie  consolidated marketing and advertising programs 
these cost savings were expected to be realized primarily in and thereafter 
a significant portion of these savings were expected to be achieved through the adoption and execution of restructuring plans during and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value was based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on various required rates of return from investments in various areas of that enterprise 
the wacc assumed for compaq  as a corporate business enterprise  was to 
the discount rate used in discounting the net cash flows from purchased in process technology ranged from for unix openvms  nt systems and storage to for advanced development projects 
this discount rate was higher than the wacc due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates described above including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances that were unknown 
if these projects are not successfully developed  the revenue and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
compaq began to benefit from the purchased in process technology in and is continuously monitoring its development projects 
management believes that the assumptions used in the valuation of purchased in process technology reasonably estimate the future benefits attributable to the purchased in process technology 
no assurance can be given that actual results will not deviate from those assumptions in future periods 
similarly  the value assigned to purchased in process technology for microcom  inc  which compaq acquired in may  was determined by identifying research projects in areas including modems  remote access technologies and others  for which technological feasibility had not been established  estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to the present value 
the discount rate included a factor which took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
restructuring and asset impairment charges in june  compaq s management approved restructuring plans which included initiatives to integrate operations of compaq and digital  consolidate duplicative facilities  improve service delivery and reduce overhead 
total restructuring costs of approximately billion were recorded in the second quarter related to these initiatives  billion of which related to digital that was recorded as a component of the preliminary purchase price allocation and million of which related to compaq that was charged to operations 
the restructuring costs recorded in the second quarter of were comprised of the following in millions compaq digital total employee separations 






 facility closure costs 





relocation 











other exit costs 








total accrued restructuring costs 
  at june   the digital restructuring plans were based on management s best estimate of those costs based on available information 
the restructuring costs accrued in june included estimates of the cost of involuntary employee separation benefits related to approximately  employees worldwide approximately  digital employees and  compaq employees 
employee separation benefits include severance  medical and other benefits 
employee separations affect the majority of business functions  job classes and geographies  with most of the reductions occurring in north america and europe 
the restructuring plans also include costs associated with the closure of million square feet of office  distribution and manufacturing space  principally in north america and europe 
other accrued restructuring costs relate to the relocation of digital employees  with the majority of this amount attributable to relocations in north america and europe  and the cost of terminating certain digital contractual obligations 
compaq expects that most of the restructuring actions will be completed by june in the fourth quarter of  compaq adjusted the digital restructuring plan which resulted in a reduction of million of accrued digital restructuring costs 
this reduction was recorded as an adjustment to the preliminary purchase price allocation during the quarter ended december  there was no adjustment to the compaq restructuring plan 
the adjustment to the digital restructuring plan included a million net increase in severance costs 
this increase was primarily due to higher than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in europe  partially offset by higher than expected attrition rates 
while the total digital employee separation target of  is expected to be achieved  digital involuntary separations are expected to decrease to approximately  as a result of the higher than expected rate of attrition 
the higher severance costs were more than offset by lower facility closure costs of million  primarily due to lower than expected costs to dispose of facilities 
in addition  the estimate of employee relocation costs was reduced by million due to a lower than expected number of employees accepting relocation packages 
the accrued restructuring costs and amounts charged against the accrual as of december   were as follows beginning cash remaining in millions accrual expenditures adjustment accrual employee separations 






 facility closure costs 





relocation 











other exit costs 








total accrued restructuring costs 
  cash expenditures are not reflective of the actual costs incurred due to the impact of regulatory guidelines in certain countries relating to the timing of payment of severance benefits to affected employees 
as of december   employee separations due to restructuring actions totaled  total severance costs related to these individuals  including the cash payments of million already made  are approximately million 
the total net headcount reduction since the acquisition of digital including attrition and restructuring  partially offset by selective hiring  was approximately  during  compaq also recorded a million charge related to asset impairments 
the asset impairments resulted from the writedown to fair market value  less costs to sell  of assets taken out of service and held for sale or disposal 
the majority of this charge related to the impairment of million of intangible assets associated with the acquisition of a company during that developed  manufactured  and supplied fast ethernet hubs  switches and related products 
in may  management decided to close the manufacturing facility and abandoned the technologies acquired through this acquisition and discontinued all related products 
compaq s selling  general and administrative costs are expected to decrease in the future through the continued implementation of the company s restructuring plans 
other items in  compaq s other income was million as compared to other income of million in and other expense of million in the increase in was primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income related to greater cash and short term investment balances prior to the digital acquisition and a reduction in other expenses  partially offset by the minority interest dividend paid to digital preferred shareholders 
the increase in other income in was primarily driven by an increase in interest and dividend income related to greater average cash and short term investment balances  partially offset by interest expense 
the translation gains and losses relating to the financial statements of compaq s international subsidiaries  net of offsetting gains and losses associated with hedging activities relating to the net monetary assets of these subsidiaries  are included in other income and expense and resulted in net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources compaq s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to billion at december   from billion at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in was primarily due to the cash payment made to acquire digital of approximately billion billion net of cash acquired  the completion of a tender offer for the digital notes and debentures of million  the repurchase of million shares of common stock for million  cash spent for restructuring activities of million  investments made in of million  as discussed below  cash dividends paid to compaq shareholders of million and cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million 
operating activities generated million in cash in  compared to billion in and billion in  respectively 
the decrease in cash generated by operating activities in compared to was significantly affected by the net loss in offset by the purchased in process technology acquired from digital of approximately billion and an increase in accounts receivable 
accounts receivable increased to billion in from billion in  primarily due to the acquisition of digital 
from time to time  compaq may sell accounts receivable when it is economically beneficial 
accounts receivable sold at december  were million and billion at december  inventory levels increased to billion at december   compared to billion at december   due to the acquisition of digital and increased unit volumes 
these increases were partially offset by changes in production planning as a result of compaq s transition to the optimized distribution model 
inventory turns improved to in versus in cash used for investments included a ten percent preferred equity position in a business venture with time warner  advance newhouse  mediaone and microsoft for approximately million 
the venture provides internet services and intends to accelerate the delivery of broadband services over cable modems to consumers and small businesses under the road runner brand 
cash used for investments also included the acquisition of a lease portfolio from ge capital for approximately million 
compaq plans to use cash to develop the purchased in process technology related to the digital acquisition into commercially viable products 
this primarily consists of the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  high volume manufacturing verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
bringing the purchased in process technology to market also includes developing firmware and diagnostic software  device driver development  and testing the technology for compatibility and interoperability with commercially viable products 
as of the date of acquisition  the estimated costs to be incurred to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products totaled approximately billion in the aggregate through the year the remainder to be spent is estimated to be million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million in future uses of cash also include cash expenditures for currently planned restructuring activities which are estimated to be billion  capital expenditures for land  buildings and equipment in which are estimated to be million  and the redemption of the series a digital preferred stock expected to occur on april  for approximately million plus accrued dividends 
other future sources and uses of cash include a cash tender offer in january for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of shopping 
com  an on line retailer that offers internet shoppers an array of consumer products 
in february the offer was successfully concluded  with of the shares tendered 
compaq is proceeding with the steps necessary to complete the merger  which is anticipated in march 
the aggregate purchase price for shopping 
com is anticipated to be approximately million 
completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions  including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act 
the execution of a definitive merger agreement with zip corporation  the leading provider of internet platform solutions for media companies and local e commerce merchants in february the aggregate purchase price for zip corporation is anticipated to be approximately million 
completion of the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act 
the formation of the altavista company in january  a wholly owned subsidiary established to become a leading internet site for search capabilities  localized information  e commerce and e services 
compaq will contribute to altavista the altavista search site and the associated intellectual property  shopping 
com  zip corporation  and certain additional cash and assets 
compaq anticipates offering a portion of the altavista company to the public in compaq currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances  internally generated funds and financing arrangements 
compaq from time to time may borrow funds for actual or anticipated funding needs 
in october  compaq entered into a one year billion unsecured revolving credit facility to replace a similar facility that expired in september compaq also has a billion syndicated credit facility that expires in september both of these facilities were unused at december  compaq has established a commercial paper program  supported by the syndicated credit facility  which was unused at december  compaq believes that these sources of credit provide sufficient financial flexibility to meet future funding requirements 
compaq continually evaluates the need to establish other sources of working capital and will pursue those it considers appropriate based upon its needs and market conditions 
factors that may affect future results compaq participates in a highly volatile industry that is characterized by fierce industry wide competition for market share 
industry participants confront aggressive pricing practices  continually changing customer demand patterns  growing competition from well capitalized high technology and consumer electronics companies  and rapid technological developments carried out in the midst of legal disputes over intellectual property rights and the application of antitrust laws 
in accordance with the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the cautionary statements set forth below discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the projected results contained in the forward looking statements in this report 
market environment 
compaq expects the personal computer market to expand in in line with third party research organizations forecasts of unit growth of 
the company expects the enterprise market to expand with the development of internet and intranet enterprise applications and the corporate mis migration from legacy systems to client server systems 
this expansion represents an opportunity for compaq s services business to help enable customers to implement and manage these new environments 
with its acquisition of tandem computers incorporated in the third quarter of and the acquisition of digital equipment corporation in the second quarter of  compaq confronts a challenge in building the high end unix solutions market while continuing to advance the sphere of nt based solutions to achieve the lowest cost of ownership and the highest computing value for its customers 
although compaq has programs  products and services focused on meeting market demand  gaining market share profitably and maintaining gross margins  compaq s ability to achieve these goals is subject to the risks set forth in this discussion 
competitive environment 
competition remains fierce in the information technology industry with a large number of competitors vying for market share 
competition creates an aggressive pricing environment  which continues to put pressure on gross margins 
a number of personal computer companies sell directly to end users and  particularly in the us  direct sales have increased as a percentage of the total personal computer market 
compaq has established a variety of programs designed to increase its manufacturing  distribution  and business process efficiencies to enable it to compete more effectively in its pc business 
compaq sells directly to end users in its enterprise and service businesses 
the success of its programs to increase its business efficiencies depends upon compaq s ability to continue its successful working relationship with its resellers  to maintain and increase its enterprise and service businesses  to both predict and react quickly to market responses by its competitors  and to continue the implementation of its optimized distribution model  the goal of which is to implement more efficient component supply  manufacturing  and distribution strategies to increase overall efficiencies 
risks of newly acquired businesses 
as a result of the acquisition of digital  compaq has  and will continue to  expand its service offerings and enterprise solutions 
this expansion includes a number of risks associated with digital s business 
compaq believes that the digital acquisition will enhance its operating results  but as with any significant acquisition or merger  it confronts challenges in maintaining key industry alliances and synchronizing product roadmaps and business processes and integrating logistics  marketing  product development  services and manufacturing operations to achieve greater efficiencies 
while compaq has increased its service revenue through this acquisition  there are risks associated with the service business  which include jeopardizing compaq s long term relationships with third party resellers while it provides services directly to end user customers 
compaq has also made certain estimates in connection with the value of purchased in process technology 
if these projects are not successfully developed  its future revenue and profitability may be adversely affected and the value of other intangibles could be reduced 
this risk is more fully discussed under purchased in process technology 
compaq plans to continue to use strategic acquisitions and mergers to assist in the growth of its business 
inventory 
in the event of a drop in worldwide demand for computer products  lower than anticipated demand for one or more of compaq s products  difficulties in managing product transitions  or component pricing movements  there could be an adverse impact on inventory levels  cash  and related profitability 
rapid technology cycles 
compaq believes the computer industry will continue to drive rapid technology cycles 
in planning product transitions  it evaluates the speed at which customers are likely to switch to newer products 
the contrast between prices of old and new products  which is related to component costs  is a critical variable in predicting customer decisions to move to the next generation of products 
because of the lead times associated with its volume production  should compaq be unable to gauge the rate of product transitions accurately  there could be an adverse impact on inventory levels  cash  and profitability 
in addition  as a result of the tandem and digital acquisitions  compaq is engaged in direct sales of computer systems with software developed to meet customers specific needs 
the long term nature of such contracts exposes compaq to risks associated with changing customer needs and expectations 
product transitions 
in each product cycle  compaq confronts the risk of delays in production that could impact sales of newer products while it manages the inventory of older products and facilitates the sale of older inventory held by resellers 
to ease product transitions  compaq carries out pricing actions and marketing programs to increase sales by resellers 
it provides currently for estimated product returns and price protection that may occur under reseller programs and under floor planning arrangements with third party finance companies 
should compaq be unable to sell the inventory of older products at anticipated prices  should it not anticipate pricing actions that are necessary  or if dealers hold higher than expected amounts of inventory subject to price protection at the time of planned price reductions  there could be a resulting adverse impact on revenues  gross margins  and profitability 
systems implementation 
compaq continues to focus on making business and information management processes more efficient in order to increase customer satisfaction  improve productivity and lower costs 
in the event of a delay in implementing improvements  there could be an adverse impact on inventory levels  cash and related profitability 
in connection with these efforts  compaq is moving many of its systems from a legacy environment of proprietary systems to client server architectures as well as integrating systems from newly acquired businesses 
integrating the systems at digital and tandem complicates this process 
should the transition to new systems not occur in a smooth and orderly manner  compaq could experience disruptions in operations  which could have an adverse financial impact 
technology standards and key licenses 
participants in the computer industry generally rely on the creation and implementation of technology standards to win the broadest market acceptance for their products 
compaq must successfully manage and participate in the development of standards while continuing to differentiate its products and services in a manner valued by customers 
while industry participants generally accept  and may encourage  the use of their intellectual property by third parties under license when intellectual property owned by competitors or suppliers becomes accepted as an industry standard  compaq must obtain a license  purchase components utilizing such technology from the owners of such technology or their licensees  or otherwise acquire rights to use such technology  which could result in increased costs 
compaq has entered into license agreements with key industry participants 
there can be no assurance that it will be able to negotiate terms that give it a competitive market advantage under the license agreements that are necessary to operate its business in the future 
production forecasts 
in managing production  compaq must forecast customer demand for its products 
should the company underestimate the supplies needed to meet demand  it could be unable to meet customer demand 
should it overestimate the supplies needed to meet customer demand  cash and profitability could be adversely affected 
many of the components used in compaq s products  particularly microprocessors and memory  experience steep price declines over their product lives 
if the company is unable to manage purchases and utilization of such components efficiently to maintain low inventory levels immediately prior to major price declines  it could be unable to take immediate advantage of such declines to lower product costs  which could adversely affect revenues and gross margins 
furthermore  should prices for components increase unexpectedly  compaq s gross margin could be adversely affected 
credit risks 
compaq s primary means of distribution is through third party resellers 
it continually monitors and manages the credit it extends to resellers and attempts to limit credit risks by broadening distribution channels  utilizing certain risk transfer arrangements and obtaining security interests 
compaq s business could be adversely affected in the event that the financial condition of third party computer resellers erodes 
upon the financial failure of a major reseller  the company could experience disruptions in distribution as well as a loss associated with the unsecured portion of any outstanding accounts receivable 
geographic expansion  particularly manufacturing operations in developing countries  such as brazil and china  and the expansion of sales into economically volatile areas such as asia pacific  latin america and other emerging markets  subject compaq to a number of economic and other risks  such as financial instability among resellers in these regions 
compaq generally has experienced longer accounts receivable cycles in emerging markets  in particular asia pacific and latin america  when compared to us and european markets 
in addition  geographic expansion subjects compaq to political and financial instability of the countries into which compaq expands  including currency devaluation and interest rate fluctuations 
the company continues to evaluate business operations in these regions and attempts to take measures to limit risks in these areas 
year compliance 
the following disclosure is a year readiness disclosure statement pursuant to the year readiness and disclosure act 
compaq s year program is designed to minimize the possibility of serious year interruptions 
possible year worst case scenarios include the interruption of significant parts of compaq s business as a result of critical information systems failure or the failure of suppliers  distributors or customers 
any such interruption may have a material adverse impact on future results 
since their possibility cannot be eliminated  compaq is incorporating year concerns into its contingency plans for dealing with catastrophic events 
in addition  compaq is monitoring the need to develop contingency plans to remediate information systems scheduled to be replaced by systems renewal efforts in case delays in the installation schedule for the new systems make remediation of the older systems necessary 
in  compaq established a task force to address its personal computer product and customer concerns  and a separate task force to address its internal information systems  including technology infrastructure and embedded technology systems  and the compliance of its suppliers and distributors 
in  compaq integrated the tandem and digital task forces with those of its own so that the task force now addresses the product and information systems and supplier and distributor concerns for the entire company 
with respect to product readiness  the compliance definitions of compaq  tandem and digital remain in effect for most of the respective follow on products of each company 
the readiness status of compaq  tandem and digital products is available on the compaq year web site at www 
compaq 
com year in addition to selling tested products  compaq also offers a range of year readiness services 
because there is no uniform definition of year compliance and because all customer situations cannot be anticipated  particularly those involving other vendors products  compaq may see a change in demand or an increase in warranty and other claims as a result of the year transition 
such events  should they occur  could have a material adverse impact on future results 
in  substantially all internal information systems and other infrastructure areas including communication systems  building security systems and embedded technologies in areas such as manufacturing processes were identified  assessed  and categorized for year readiness as priority  and  with being critical  being intermediate and being non critical 
during the fourth quarter of  the year program experienced a significant increase in work resulting from the digital tandem integrations and new business directions 
additional resources have been added and the necessary steps have been taken to maintain the following goals priority and priority items will be year compliant by june   and priority items are to be ready by december  or replaced or left undetermined 
as of the end of the fourth quarter of  compaq completed remediation on approximately of the priority items  and expects to be approximately complete by the end of march specific contingency plans are being made with respect to any priority listings which cannot be tested or determined to be compliant 
also  key suppliers and distributors have been identified and compaq is in the process of communicating with them about their year readiness plans and progress 
in each of these areas  various testing and readiness determination methodologies are being used  based on what is appropriate for each type of system  supplier or distributor 
coincident with year readiness efforts  compaq is rapidly integrating the digital operations worldwide 
this includes rationalization of internal systems  facilities and other infrastructure 
compaq is also carrying out major planned enterprise wide internal system renewal efforts 
these planned major enterprise wide system renewals have been incorporated into the year readiness effort 
installations are scheduled through the end of based on compaq s ongoing evaluation of internal information and other systems  the integration of digital operations  and system renewal roll out schedules  compaq does not anticipate significant business interruption 
however  should business interruption occur  there could be a material adverse impact on future results 
with respect to suppliers and distributors  because compaq s readiness depends upon their cooperation in identifying  disclosing and remediating problems  failures on the part of suppliers and distributors remain a possibility and could have a material adverse impact on future results 
the costs of the readiness program for products are primarily costs of existing internal resources largely absorbed within existing engineering spending levels 
these costs were incurred primarily in and earlier years and were not broken out from other product engineering costs 
no future material product readiness costs are anticipated 
the costs of the readiness program for internal information and other systems and suppliers and distributors are a combination of incremental external spending and use of existing internal resources and expertise 
over the life of the internal readiness effort  these costs are estimated to be million  of which approximately has been incurred to date 
the costs of implementing enterprise wide system renewal efforts are not included in this estimate 
milestones and implementation dates and the costs of compaq s year readiness program are subject to change based on new circumstances that may arise or new information becoming available that may change underlying assumptions or requirements 
euro conversion 
effective january   of the member countries of the european union have adopted the euro as their common legal currency 
on that date  the participating countries established fixed euro conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro now trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
the participating countries now issue sovereign debt exclusively in euros  and have redenominated outstanding sovereign debt 
the authority to direct monetary policy for the participating countries  including money supply and official interest rates for the euro  is now exercised by the new european central bank 
in  compaq established a euro task force to address its pc product and customer concerns  and a separate task force to address compaq s internal information systems 
compaq hopes to achieve euro product readiness and enable internal information systems to conduct electronic transactions in the euro within the first quarter of the schedule and details of subsequent phases of internal systems readiness is under review  but will comply with implementation schedules set by the european commission 
we do not believe the costs of the overall effort will have a material adverse impact on future results 
however  since all customer situations cannot be anticipated  compaq may see a change in demand or an increase in warranty and other claims as a result of the euro implementation 
such events  should they occur  could have a material adverse impact on future results 
based on compaq s ongoing evaluation of internal information systems  integration of digital operations and system renewal roll out schedules  compaq does not anticipate significant business interruption 
however  should a significant business interruption occur  there could be a material adverse impact on future results 
with respect to compliance by suppliers and distributors  failures remain a possibility and could have a material adverse impact on future results 
milestones and implementation dates of compaq s euro readiness program are subject to change based on new circumstances that may arise or new information becoming available  which changes underlying assumptions or requirements 
tax rate 
compaq currently has a effective tax rate  before the effect of non deductible purchased in process technology and merger related costs  and expects this rate will increase to in compaq benefits from a tax holiday in singapore that expires in  with a potential extension to august if certain cumulative investment levels and other conditions are maintained 
compaq s tax rate is heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings that is derived from its singaporean manufacturing subsidiary and its ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the us if the earnings of this subsidiary as a percentage of compaq s total earnings were to decline significantly from current levels  or should compaq s ability to reinvest these earnings be reduced  compaq s effective tax rate would increase 
in addition  should compaq s intercompany transfer pricing with respect to its singaporean manufacturing subsidiary require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  compaq s overall effective tax rate could increase 
at december  compaq has recorded a net deferred tax asset of billion 
compaq has determined it is more likely than not that this asset will be realized 
the future utilization of these deferred tax assets may be restricted from future use by certain limitations imposed by taxing authorities or by a lack of sufficient income generated in the taxing jurisdictions in which the asset arose 
if these limitations are significant  or if the circumstances surrounding the expected deductibility of the items change  the ultimate realization of these assets may be adversely impacted and could have an adverse impact on future results 
currency fluctuations 
compaq s risks associated with currency fluctuations are discussed in item a below 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting compaq s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a 
market risk s compaq is exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
it attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions  pursuant to company policies 
compaq uses market valuations and value at risk valuation methods to preliminarily assess market risk of its financial instruments and derivative portfolios 
it uses jp morgan s riskmetrics to estimate the value at risk of its financial instruments and derivative portfolios based on estimates of volatility and correlation of market factors drawn from jp morgan s riskmetrics data sets for the dates calculated 
riskmetrics defines loss as a reduction in the value of a portfolio in the event of adverse market conditions  using a predetermined confidence interval  over a specified period of time 
compaq included all fixed income investments and foreign exchange contracts in the value at risk calculation 
see note and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these instruments 
the holding period for these instruments varies from two days to nine months 
the measured value at risk from holding derivative and other financial instruments  using a confidence level and assuming normal market conditions during the periods ended december  and was immaterial 
the value of the us dollar affects compaq s financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect compaq s revenues as expressed in us dollars  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings 
compaq engages in hedging programs aimed at limiting in part the impact of currency fluctuations 
using primarily forward exchange contracts  compaq hedges those assets and liabilities that  when remeasured according to generally accepted accounting principles  impact the income statement 
for certain markets  particularly latin america  compaq has determined that ongoing hedging of non us dollar net monetary assets is not cost effective and instead attempts to minimize currency exposure risk through working capital management 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of local currencies 
from time to time  compaq purchases foreign currency option contracts as well as short term forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with the anticipated revenue of compaq s international marketing subsidiaries  with the exception of latin america and certain other subsidiaries that reside in countries in which such activity would not be cost effective or local regulations preclude this type of activity 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of compaq s hedging programs include accuracy of sales forecasts  volatility of the currency markets  and availability of hedging instruments 
all currency contracts that are entered into by compaq are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation 
although compaq maintains these programs to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which compaq sells products and services or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which compaq incurs costs  compaq s revenues or costs are adversely affected
