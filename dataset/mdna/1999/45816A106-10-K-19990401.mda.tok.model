year compliance historically  certain computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in the computer recognizing a date using as the year rather than this in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations  and is generally referred to as the year problem

based upon its assessment  the company has established no reserve nor instituted any contingency plans

as companies expend significant resources to correct their current data storage solutions  these expenditures may result in reduced funds to purchase products or undertake projects such as those offered by the company 
there can be no assurance that the year problem  as it relates to customers  potential customers and other third parties  will not adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
conversely  the year problem may cause other companies to accelerate purchases  thereby causing an increase in short term demand and a consequent decrease in long term demand for the company s products
