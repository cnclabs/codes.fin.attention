item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the company participates in pools of insurance covering ocean marine  inland marine  aircraft and non marine liability insurance managed by mmo and affiliates 
the company s participation in the other liability and inland marine pools increased to effective july   and its participation in the ocean marine and aviation pools increased to at the same time 
effective january   the company s participation in the ocean marine and aviation pools increased to 
these lines of businesses are considered  for operational purposes  as the company s main segments for purposes of analyzing underwriting income

b in  includes a one time assumption of miscellaneous casualty net written and earned premiums of  respectively 
unlike many types of property and casualty insurance  ocean marine  inland marine  aviation and other liability premium rates are not strictly regulated by governmental authorities 
consequently  the company is able to adjust premium rates quickly in response to competition  varying degrees of risk and other factors 
in addition  the company  by virtue of its underwriting flexibility  is able to emphasize specific lines of business in response to advantageous premium rates and the anticipation of positive underwriting results 
the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  employee benefits and rental expense for office facilities 
the company s policy acquisition costs include both brokerage commissions and premium taxes which are primarily based on a percentage of premiums written 
such costs have generally changed in proportion with changes in premium volume 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in connection with insurance claims in any particular year depend upon a variety of factors including the rate of inflation  accident or claim frequency  the occurrence of natural catastrophes and the number of policies written 
the company estimates reserves each year based upon  and in conformity with  the factors discussed under business reserves 
the company maintains a conservative policy for establishing reserves  especially in the year a policy is written 
changes in estimates of reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which the change occurs 
as compared to net income decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
diluted earnings per share decreased to in as compared to in operating income  which excludes realized investment gains  was million in compared to million in operating earnings per share on a diluted basis was in compared with in the company s net premiums earned decreased to million in as compared to million in premiums earned in reflect very competitive markets across all lines of business  premiums from syndicate and the effects of two transactions involving the assumption of premiums 
ocean marine earned premiums for this segment increased by in compared to the increase resulted from a reinsurance transaction involving a one time assumption of approximately million of premiums that emanated from syndicate  which commenced operations in the current year 
syndicate contributed an additional million in gross direct ocean marine writings in the domestic insurance companies reported a decrease in earned premiums as competition remained intense and adversely affected premium rates 
the outlook for indicates that pricing pressures will remain intact as the over capacity within this market still exists 
syndicate will also continue to write at a cautious pace 
other liability and other premiums earned for this segment were million in compared to million in the increase resulted from the second reinsurance transaction in that included a one time assumption of approximately million of miscellaneous casualty net premiums 
excluding the effect of this transaction  premiums earned would have decreased approximately in as a result of the soft casualty market which led to a decline in premium production 
the company expects the casualty market to remain competitive in with premiums likely to decline further 
the aviation segment of business was most affected by the competitive market  with gross writings down by  and coupled with the purchase of additional reinsurance protection resulted in premiums earned decreasing to million in compared with million in obtaining additional reinsurance protection is consistent with the company s strategy of minimizing risk and preserving capital as the underwriting climate for gross premiums remains soft 
in addition  large aviation gross losses resulted in additional reinsurance reinstatement costs of approximately million that further contributed to the decline in premiums 
the company expects this underwriting environment to remain competitive in inland marine gross premium writings for this segment increased to million in due in large part to writing policies that are ancillary to its ocean marine risks 
earned premiums were negative due to reinsurance costs for catastrophe protection  reinstatement costs  and quota share reinsurance which collectively amounted to approximately million 
this underwriting strategy is expected to remain in place for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned were for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
the ocean marine loss ratio for syndicate s assumption of premiums in was approximately and had the effect of increasing the overall loss ratio significantly 
absent such business  the ocean marine loss ratio for this segment would have been approximately as compared to for the prior year 
the domestic insurance companies recorded favorable net loss experience in the company s core ocean marine line largely due to lower retention levels per loss 
the other liability loss ratio for this segment increased to from in the assumption of miscellaneous net casualty premiums in was subsequently commuted in the fourth quarter of at a loss ratio of 
excluding this business  the loss ratio would have been approximately 
adverse development from prior year losses contributed to the increase 
an improvement in the frequency of losses and favorable net loss development contributed to a lower loss ratio in the aviation line in policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  were as compared with of the prior year 
the reduction in the ratio is due to the two transactions involving an assumption of premiums in excluding the effect of such business  the ratio would have been approximately for this ratio approximates the ocean marine line of business ratio as those premiums represent a larger percentage of total premiums in than in net investment income in decreased by to million from million in as a result of a decrease in investment yield in the company s fixed maturity portfolio caused by additional purchases of tax exempt securities and lower overall interest rates 
although investment yield was lower in  syndicate s operations contributed to a larger average invested asset base during the current year 
commission income in was  as compared to  for the same period of the prior year included larger profit commissions from reinsurance transactions in the aviation and ocean marine lines of business 
general and administrative expenses increased by in over the increase included operating expenses from syndicate also  certain one time expenses were incurred in connection with the assumption of premiums and the formation of syndicate lastly  contributing to the overall increase were expenses associated with two employee benefit plans adopted by the board of directors in interest expense decreased for the year ended december  to million primarily as a result of a decrease in average loan principal outstanding 
the company was able to realize investment gains of million in mainly as a result of the sale of appreciated equity securities in the company s effective tax rate at december  was as compared to in taxable income was greater in as a result of larger underwriting profits and realized investment gains 
the decrease in the effective rate was also due to increased tax exempt income as a percentage of pre tax income in reinsurance receivables at december  were million or greater than the prior year s amount 
large gross aviation losses  which were ceded under various reinsurance agreements  accounted for the increase 
accumulated other comprehensive income  which includes unrealized appreciation of investments and foreign currency translation adjustments  at december  was million as compared to million as of december  increases in unrealized appreciation of both fixed and equity securities accounted for most of the increase 
as compared to the company s net premiums earned decreased by in as compared to the decrease in premiums earned occurred in all major lines of business 
inland marine premiums recorded the largest percentage decline at in the company decided in the prior year to withdraw from writing property risks of the larger assureds with multiple locations after years of unprofitable results brought about mainly by large catastrophe losses 
in  the company concentrated on writing risks that are ancillary to its ocean marine risks 
ocean marine premiums earned fell by in mainly due to falling premium rates as competition remained intense during all classes within the ocean marine line experienced declines except for the energy class which saw increases in production 
in  the company wrote additional marine liability accounts with assureds that have smaller amounts of exposure 
also  net premium writings did not decline at the same rate as gross premiums primarily due to cheaper reinsurance costs 
although net premiums earned in the aviation line decreased by only  gross written and net written premiums decreased by and  respectively 
a softening of rates in the aviation line  resulting from excess industry capacity  initially started in and continued into and accounted for a reduction in gross aviation premiums written in during this soft underwriting cycle  the company sought to reduce overall retention levels in order to avoid the negative impact of any one loss on net income 
as a consequence of purchasing additional reinsurance  net writings fell at a greater percentage 
other liability earned premiums decreased by 
the casualty market has been severely competitive for many years 
consequently  the company continued to underwrite this line very selectively 
premiums earned did benefit  however  from the company s increased pool participation in the mutual marine office  inc ocean marine and aviation pools from to effective for policies incepting on or after january  losses and loss adjustment expenses as a percentage of premiums earned were in as compared to in improved net loss experience in the other liability and inland lines contributed to the overall decline in the loss ratios 
in addition  despite an increase in the frequency of losses in the aviation line  this loss ratio actually improved from the prior year as a result of lower retention levels on losses and favorable loss development on prior year reserves 
an increase in severity losses in the ocean marine line contributed to its higher loss ratio in policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  were as compared to for the prior year 
the company saw an improvement in the acquisition ratio in the aviation line as a result of obtaining ceding override commissions on reinsurance placed 
this had the effect of reducing overall net commissions at a greater rate than the decline in premiums 
net investment income for the year ended december  was flat as compared to the same period of as a result of a decrease in the investment yield in the company s fixed maturity portfolio 
the investment income generated from a larger invested asset base was offset by a decrease in investment yield in the company s fixed maturity portfolio as a result of additional purchases of tax exempt securities and lower interest rates overall 
commission income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the same period of commission income includes management and contingent commissions charged by mutual marine office  inc for operating the insurance pools 
as gross writings decreased and the company increased its mmo pool participation in the ocean marine and aviation pools from to effective for policies incepting on or after january   management commission income from a non affiliated member of the insurance pools declined 
general and administrative expenses increased by in primarily as a result of increased personnel and administrative costs to further strengthen support services 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in average loan principal outstanding 
the company was able to realize investment gains of million in mainly as a result of the sale of appreciated equity securities 
net income increased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
diluted earnings per share increased to in as compared to in accumulated other comprehensive income as of december  included gross unrealized gains and losses on equity securities of million and million respectively  and gross unrealized gains on fixed maturities available for sale of million 
unrealized gains were recorded in fixed and equity securities resulting from decreases in interest rates and a strong stock market in  respectively 
notes payable increased to million as of december  and resulted from loans obtained to repurchase the company s common stock 
this also contributed to the increase in treasury stock  at cost  in prepaid reinsurance premiums increased to million at december  however the reserve for unearned premiums decreased in by 
the decline in gross writings in is consistent with the change in the reserve for unearned premiums 
the company  however  reduced its net retention per loss in the aviation line which prompted prepaid reinsurance premiums  as well as ceded reinsurance payable balances  to increase accordingly 
liquidity and capital resources the company monitors cash and short term investments in order to have an adequate level of funds available to satisfy claims and expenses as they become due 
as of december   the company s assets included approximately million in cash and short term investments 
the primary sources of the company s liquidity are funds generated from insurance premiums  investment income and maturing or liquidating investments 
historically  cash provided by operating activities was used in investing and financing activities 
in and cash inflows increased as premium rates were higher in the ocean marine and aviation lines 
cash was used in operating activities in as further declines in premium rates and increases in ceded reinsurance premiums negatively affected cash from operations 
the company s maturing book of casualty business also adversely affected cash flows 
investing and financing activities increased further as a result of the company entering into a  revolving credit agreement which increased to  in with the same bank 
additional borrowings of approximately  and  were made in and  respectively  to repurchase the company s common stock 
repayments were made quarterly generally at  per quarter 
the company has an unsecured credit facility with a bank that allows for a maximum credit of  this facility was reduced in from a  amount available in the use of this credit facility will assist the company as a source of short term liquidity 
in and  amounts were borrowed to assist the insurance pools managed by the company in the payment of gross losses 
the amounts borrowed under the line of credit were fully repaid after collecting recoverables due from reinsurers on such losses 
the company adheres to investment guidelines set by the finance committee of the board of directors 
the investment guidelines are conservatively designed to provide the company with adequate capital growth and sufficient liquidity to meet existing obligations 
such guidelines consider many factors including anticipated tax position and regulatory requirements 
the company s largest investments are in bonds from various states and municipalities 
such securities receive favorable tax treatment under existing tax laws 
our investment position is monitored regularly as the company has been affected by the alternative minimum tax 
as net earnings were affected by several catastrophe losses in the mid s the company further bolstered its taxable investment position 
as the company s tax position changed with improved earnings in  additional investments were made in tax exempt securities through to improve after tax investment yield 
under the common stock repurchase plan  the company may purchase up to  of the company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock on the open market 
as of december   the company had repurchased a total of  shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately  at market prices ranging from to per share 
nymagic s principal source of cash flow is dividends from its insurance company subsidiaries which is used to fund operating expenses  including interest expense  loan repayments and payment of dividends to shareholders 
the company s domestic insurance company subsidiaries are limited by statute in the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid during a year 
the limitation restricts dividends paid or declared to the lower of of policyholders surplus or of net investment income as defined under new york insurance law 
the limitations on dividends from the insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to have an impact on the company s ability to meet current cash obligations or materially limit the current payment of dividends to the company s shareholders 
dividends can be paid from syndicate to the extent solvency margins are maintained and after the closing of a calendar year  which occurs three years following each calendar year 
impact of year the company s computer systems and electronic devices which are based on software programs which process dates with two digits rather than four to define the applicable year may assume that all years occur only in the th century 
this could cause a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations controlled by such systems or devices  including  among other things  an inability to process transactions  send invoices  engage in actuarial analyses  compute and track payment schedules  control equipment or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s exposure to this potential phenomenon is concentrated principally in its legacy hardware system  insurance business operations software  financial applications software accounts payable  general ledger and other packages  business relations  and potential underwriting losses arising from claims by insureds under the company s insurance policies for relief for losses resulting from the year phenomenon 
the following discussion is based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events  including  without limitation  the continuing availability of basic utilities and other resources  the availability of trained personnel at reasonable cost  and the ability of third parties to replace or upgrade noncompliant software and hardware at reasonable cost 
there can be no guarantee that these assumptions will prove accurate  and  accordingly  actual results may materially differ from those anticipated 
readiness and compliance plan the company separated its year compliance plan into three major phases information technology  compliance by vendors and business relations  and potential underwriting losses 
these three phases are considered the most critical components of the year efforts for the company 
information technology in  the company commenced overhauling its existing legacy mainframe computer hardware and software systems in order to improve employee productivity and financial reporting 
the company extended the project to cover year concerns 
in june   the company replaced its computer hardware system with client server architecture which is year compliant 
the company also successfully upgraded its insurance business operations software so that such software now functions with the new year compliant operating system 
the upgraded operations software was modified subsequently to be year compliant 
the company is currently testing and evaluating the year compliant version of its insurance business operations software 
based upon the status of its testing  which is currently on schedule  the company expects the testing of its business operations software to be completed by june  the company expects that its remaining software which includes financial applications for accounts payable  general ledger and other packages will be year compliant by june  the company has identified year compliant systems and is evaluating and testing data to insure compliance of the remaining software systems 
the company is approximately complete with respect to this phase of its year evaluation efforts and is currently on schedule with its compliance plans 
in the event such systems cannot be upgraded or remedied  the company would purchase and or license replacement software which is year compliant 
compliance by vendors and business relations in connection with the company s year plan  the company is in the process of communicating with its various business relationships and vendors to determine the extent of their year compliance 
the company mailed questionnaires to approximately companies which the company considers to have an important relationship with the company 
to date  the company received responses from approximately of such companies indicating that they are in the process of becoming year compliant before january  in  the company selected the largest producers for the company  which accounts for approximately of the company s gross writings for the domestic insurance companies as of december   and requested additional information to evidence their year compliance 
also  the company is soliciting the non responding companies to determine the extent of their compliance 
the company is current with its timetable on this phase of its compliance plan and believes that it will complete analyzing the year compliance of its business relationships by july in the event that a business relationship does not respond to the company or does not demonstrate that its own systems are year compliant  then such business relationships may need to be terminated which may result in a material and adverse effect on the company s business  assets  prospects  liquidity and financial condition 
potential underwriting losses property casualty insurance companies may have an underwriting exposure related to the year phenomenon 
although the company has not received any claims for coverage from insureds based on losses resulting from year issues  there can be no assurance that insureds will be free from losses of this type or that the company will be free from claims made under the company s insurance policies 
if any claims are made  coverage  if any  will depend on the facts and circumstances of the claim and the provisions of the subject insurance policy 
the company  in certain instances  has been able to include year exclusions in its policy forms 
also  the company is requesting information from certain insureds as to the extent of their year compliance 
the company will continue to monitor policies throughout the year as a result of compliance under this phase of its year evaluation efforts 
at this time  the company is unable to determine whether the adverse impact and or extent of underwriting losses  if any  in connection with the foregoing circumstances would be material to the company 
cost of year compliance the company estimates  based on its evaluations and actions taken to date  that the aggregate cost of its information technology project  including the cost of achieving year compliance  will be approximately  of which approximately  has been expended through december  these costs excluding internal personnel expenses are comprised of outside consulting service costs for evaluation and upgrade of systems  acquisition costs for new equipment and componentry  and licensing and purchase fees for new and upgraded software 
this process has not had a material impact on the status of other internal technology projects 
contingency plan  actual results may differ the company is in the beginning stages of developing a contingency plan in the event that its insurance business operation software is not placed into use 
this plan  which has not been finalized  includes a combination of purchasing personal computers and utilizing manual systems 
the contingency plan also addresses year issues relating to environmental concerns 
this includes telephone and security systems  copiers  electrical availability  etc 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate suitable cost efficient replacements or upgrades to computer hardware and software which are year compliant  and the ability to correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that the company will be immune from underwriting losses arising from year  and such losses may result in a material and adverse effect on the company s business  assets  liquidity and financial condition 
market risk market risk includes the potential for future losses due to reasonably possible changes in the fair value of financial instruments which relates mainly to the company s investment portfolio 
those risks associated with the investment portfolio include the effects of exposure to adverse changes in interest rates  credit quality  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
the largest market risk to the company relates to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk includes the changes in the fair value of fixed maturities based upon changes in interest rates 
this risk is considered when developing our benchmarks for evaluating our portfolio 
such benchmarks are tied into the overall duration of the company s loss reserves 
through the matching of cash flows from future maturing investments and the ultimate payout pattern of loss reserves  the company can minimize the effect of interest rate risk 
the following tabular presentation outlines the expected cash flows of fixed maturities available for sale for each of the next five years and the aggregate cash flows expected for the remaining years thereafter based upon maturity dates 
fixed maturities include taxable and tax exempt securities with applicable weighted average interest rates 
taxables also include mortgage backed securities that have prepayment features which may cause actual cash flows to differ from those based on maturity date 
future cash flows of expected principal amounts in millions total total there amortized fair fixed maturities after cost value tax exempt average interest rate taxables average interest rate total credit quality risk includes the risk of default by issuers of debt securities 
the company s investment guidelines are conservatively designed and prevent the investment in securities below an a rating 
overall  the company has maintained fixed maturities with an average credit quality rating of aa as of december  the company s exposure to credit risk is considered minimal 
foreign currency risk includes exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on the market value and interest income of foreign denominated investments 
syndicate operations maintain an equivalent of million in investments in british pounds sterling to the extent business is derived from transactions in such currency 
the investment of cash flows from business written in pounds sterling in securities of the same foreign currency  will ultimately mitigate the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates 
equity risk includes the potential loss from changes in the fair value of equity securities 
the company s equity securities are traded on major stock exchanges and are highly liquid 
these securities are limited by investment guidelines to of statutory surplus in order to minimize the impact of large changes in the stock market 
the company monitors market risks on a regular basis through meetings with investment advisors  examining the existing portfolio and reviewing potential changes in investment guidelines 
the overall effect of which is to allow management to make informed decisions concerning the impact that market risks have on the portfolio 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june sfas requires derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives not considered as hedges must be recorded at fair value with adjustments recorded in the income statement 
for derivatives that qualify as a hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities and are recognized in the income statement or in other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the hedge 
sfas is effective for years beginning after june  the company uses derivatives  in the form of an interest rate swap  for hedging purposes as part of its interest rate management 
the company has not yet determined the effect of sfas on its financial statements 
inflation periods of inflation have prompted the pools  and consequently the company  to react quickly to actual or potential imbalances between costs  including claim expenses  and premium rates 
these imbalances have been corrected mainly through improved underwriting controls  responsive management information systems and frequent review of premium rates and loss experience 
inflation also affects the final settlement costs of claims which may not be paid for several years 
the longer a claim takes to settle  the more significant the impact of inflation on final settlement costs 
the company periodically reviews outstanding claims and adjusts reserves for the pools based on a number of factors  including inflation
