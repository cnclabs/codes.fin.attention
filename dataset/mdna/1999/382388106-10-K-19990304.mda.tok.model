the company is continuing to evaluate realignment of its operations to improve efficiencies and reduce costs 
acquisitions on december   bfgoodrich completed a merger with rohr  inc by exchanging  shares of bfgoodrich common stock for all of the common stock of rohr the term company is used to refer to bfgoodrich including rohr 
each share of rohr common stock was exchanged for 
of one share of bfgoodrich common stock 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and all prior period financial statements were restated to include the financial information of rohr as though rohr had always been a part of bfgoodrich 
prior to the merger  rohr s fiscal year ended on july for purposes of the combination  rohr s financial results for its fiscal year ended july   were restated to the year ended december   to conform with bfgoodrich s calendar year end 
financial results for rohr s fiscal years ended july  and earlier were not restated to conform to bfgoodrich s calendar year end 
for periods prior to  rohr s fiscal years ended july have been combined with bfgoodrich s calendar years ended december as a result  rohr s results of operations for the period august  to december   do not appear in the consolidated statement of income and instead are recorded as a direct adjustment to equity 
rohr s revenues  expenses and net loss for this five month period were million  million and million  respectively 
included in expenses during this period was a million pretax charge million after tax relating to the mcdonnell douglas md program see discussion under aerostructures group 
the following acquisitions were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
their results of operations were included in the company s results since their respective dates of acquisition 
in march  the company acquired a global manufacturer of specialty and fine chemicals that are sold to a variety of customers who use them to enhance the performance of their finished products 
the company also acquired a small manufacturer of textile chemicals used for fabric preparation and finishing and a small manufacturer of energetic materials systems during during  the company acquired five businesses for cash consideration of million in the aggregate  which included million of goodwill 
one of the acquired businesses is a manufacturer of data acquisition systems for satellites and other aerospace applications 
a second business manufactures diverse aerospace products for commercial and military applications 
a third business is a manufacturer of dyes  chemical additives and durable press resins for the textiles industry 
a fourth business manufactures thermoplastic polyurethane and is located in the united kingdom 
the remaining acquisition is a small specialty chemicals business 
during  the company acquired five specialty chemicals businesses for cash consideration of million  which included million of goodwill 
one of the businesses acquired is a european based supplier of emulsions and polymers for use in paint and coatings for textiles  paper  graphic arts and industrial applications 
two of the acquisitions represented product lines consisting of water borne acrylic resins and coatings and additives used in the graphic arts industry 
the fourth acquisition consisted of water based textile coatings product lines 
the remaining acquisition was a small supplier of anti static compounds 
compared with aerospace market overview the aerospace industry recorded another strong year in  elevating bgoodrich aerospace to its highest ever levels of sales and operating income 
deliveries of large commercial aircraft increased percent over  while deliveries of regional aircraft increased percent in revenue passenger miles  a key indicator of market demand  also rose during the year despite the softening of asia pacific demand 
world airline passenger traffic increased an estimated percent over the prior year  while us domestic revenue passenger miles increased by percent 
military spending remained relatively flat in segment performance the aerospace segment s sales in were  million 
forty two percent of sales were to commercial transport programs boeing and airbus 
sales to civil aviation customers were percent in  an increase from percent in military sales comprised percent of aerospace sales  the same level as last year 
the aerospace segment s operating income improved percent during in addition to the group specific results discussed below  the segment as a whole benefited principally from higher volume supplemented by the continued implementation of productivity initiatives  including lean manufacturing and procurement improvement efforts 
of sales change in millions sales aerostructures   landing systems sensors and integrated systems mro total sales   operating income aerostructures landing systems sensors and integrated systems mro n a total operating income aerostructures group aerostructures group sales for of  million were million  or percent  higher than in contributing to the increased sales were higher aftermarket spares sales and accelerated deliveries on many commercial programs  including the v a aircraft and the start up of production deliveries on the program 
these increases were partially offset by reduced deliveries on the a program 
the aerostructures group s operating income of million included a million pretax special charge for costs associated with the closure of three facilities and the impairment of a fourth see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income of million in was adversely impacted by a million pretax charge on the md contract 
excluding these special items  operating income increased in by million  or percent  primarily as a result of increased sales volume and by the proportionately higher ratio of aftermarket spares sales to production sales 
aftermarket spare sales generally carry a higher margin than production sales 
landing systems group sales in the landing systems group of million were million  or percent  higher than in sales growth reflected higher original equipment demand for landing gear and evacuation products  as well as stronger than expected aftermarket demand for aircraft wheels and brakes 
principal landing gear programs were the b and b nose gear 
landing gear sales volumes also reflected the establishment of a facility in seattle to provide fully dressed landing gears to boeing on the b program 
commercial wheel and brake demand was strongest on the a  b  and b programs 
evacuation product sales increased on the b and a a programs 
the evacuation systems business also completed in october the acquisition of universal propulsion company upco which is expected to enhance the business s safety systems offerings through its direct thermal inflation technology 
upco manufactures energetic materials systems used to activate ejection seats  airplane evacuation slides and related products 
operating income in the landing systems group increased percent in higher sales and favorable product mix benefited the group s operating income 
certain factors  however  constrained income growth 
those factors included higher wheel and brake strategic sales incentives  principally for the b  b  and airbus programs  higher product development costs  offset in part by cost reduction initiatives in operations  and increased landing gear manufacturing costs associated with the increase in production to match original equipment manufacturers build rates 
sensors and integrated systems group sensors and integrated systems group sales of million were million  or percent  higher than in sales of the group were split nearly equally between the large commercial transport customers percent  regional  business and general aviation percent  military percent and space percent 
all four markets experienced increased sales for the year 
demand for sensor and avionics products was particularly strong 
increased sales of sensor products were driven by rate increases on major boeing programs  retrofit of competitors products on airbus programs and the application of products to new regional and business programs such as embraer  gulfstream v  and bombardier global express 
the higher sales of avionics products was fueled by greater than anticipated acceptance of a new  low cost collision avoidance product skywatch r and strong associated sales of our stormscope r line of lightning detectors 
expansion of our ice protection product line  including new specialty heated products  also contributed to the results 
the group s sales performance was further enhanced by higher demand for satellite products acquired in the march purchase of gulton data systems that was driven by expansion of our capabilities and product offerings 
the group s operating income improved percent in  to million  compared with million in the increase reflects the higher sales volumes  the impact of productivity initiatives  a favorable sales mix  and new products introduced during the year 
maintenance  repair and overhaul mro group the mro group s sales of million were million  or percent  higher than in during  the mro group achieved higher sales volumes compared with  successfully replacing the sales which were lost after the bankruptcy in early of western pacific airlines and the termination of an america west airlines maintenance contract 
new business included long term service contracts with  in addition to others  qantas  continental  northwest  united  and virgin atlantic airlines 
sales improved due to higher volumes in the airframe and component services businesses 
the performance of the component services business reflects strong demand for wheels and brakes and nacelles services 
new business assisting boeing in paint and other component services also contributed to the improved results 
the mro group reported significantly higher operating income in  even after giving consideration to the million bad debt charge recognized in due to the bankruptcy of western pacific airlines 
increased operating income in was attributable to improved operating efficiencies in the component services business and the introduction of new higher margin specialized services 
the group also benefited from substantially reduced turnover of the certified airframe and powerplant mechanics work force in the airframe business  compared with the prior two years 
although the group s operating income margin increased during compared with percent versus percent excluding the bad debt charge  several factors constrained the growth of operating income and margins in first  the group s landing gear services business in miami completed the construction of a new world class service facility also in the miami area in mid much of the second half of was spent transitioning operations from the old facility to the new one  during which time duplicate facility costs and production inefficiencies were incurred 
this business also incurred significant charges to resolve several customer billing disputes  largely from the prior year 
management believes the impact of these items is nonrecurring 
second  start up costs were incurred by the group s airframe business in connection with a new major customer  resulting from servicing aircraft new to the business 
finally  the airframe business commenced in the development of a major new business system  the implementation of which is expected to be completed by mid as a result  the business increased inventory valuation reserves and expensed development related costs 
excluding the impact of the above charges  operating income margins in would have been slightly above percent rather than percent 
outlook despite well founded concerns about asian and latin american economies  the aerospace industry is expected to experience continued growth in deliveries of large commercial transport aircraft a common barometer of the health of the industry are anticipated to increase by percent over s record levels per the january february edition of the airline monitor 
airline traffic is also expected to remain strong since the general economy is healthy and business and leisure travel have become more affordable 
additionally  the demand for aftermarket replacement parts should remain steady as airlines continue to retrofit older airplanes to meet faa stage iii noise regulations and to comply with stricter safety guidelines 
the regional market is expected to remain strong in with revenue passenger miles anticipated to grow approximately percent per the january february edition of the airline monitor 
the average number of seats in regional commuter aircraft is expected to increase as longer range turbo jet aircraft replace older turbo props within regional airline fleets 
this trend is substantiated by the regional jet forecast  which reveals declining turbo prop production and increasing turbo jet production in the long term 
bfgoodrich aerospace had anticipated the shifting mix of regional aircraft and currently participates on the latest regional jet programs such as the global express  dornier family  embraer and the canadair rj 
unlike the regional market  production of business jets is expected to remain flat in however  bfgoodrich aerospace believes that its position on such new platforms as the cessna citation x  the canadair challenger  and the gulfstream g v bode well for success in the aftermarket 
bfgoodrich aerospace expects to maintain its current level of participation in the military aerospace market at approximately percent of total aerospace sales 
as in  military spending is expected to decline slightly in real terms in although funding for additional programs is limited  the segment participates in many of the newest military programs  including the joint strike fighter and the v furthermore  an opportunity exists for the segment to increase sales of replacement products to defense customers 
the segment is well positioned to capture a larger share of the military aftermarket with products currently on the f  f  f a  c  h  c j  and ah programs 
the airline industry enjoyed a profitable year in and anticipates another strong year in with their success has come continued outsourcing of non core functions  including maintenance  repair  and overhaul 
bfgoodrich aerospace expects to sustain its role as a leader in the third party maintenance industry by providing the highest quality  comprehensive nose to tail services 
the mro group expects to achieve greater efficiencies in after the investment in in a new landing gear repair and overhaul facility in miami 
in addition to process improvements  the new facility is expected to bring about faster turn around times and better service to our customers 
performance materials market overview the markets for most of the performance materials segment s products softened throughout market pressures included the asian and other emerging market financial crises as well as slowing demand in most of the other markets served by the segment 
segment performance as a result of the more competitive market conditions noted above  the segment s percent increase in sales only resulted in a percent increase in operating income 
while the acquisition of freedom chemical in march contributed significantly to the increase in sales during the year  its concentrations in these areas of particular market weakness resulted in a less than expected contribution to operating income in the acquisition has  however  better positioned the segment for future growth by expanding its global reach  adding to its product portfolio and extending its market breadth 
excluding acquisitions  the segment experienced a percent increase in sales and a percent increase in operating income due to favorable raw material costs and production efficiencies 
the impact of foreign exchange was not significant to s results 
of sales comparable change change in millions sales textile and industrial coatings polymer additives and specialty plastics consumer specialties total  operating income textile and industrial coatings polymer additives and specialty plastics consumer specialties total the following discussion and analysis of fluctuations in sales and operating income for the performance materials segment excludes the impact of acquisitions see comparable change column 
textile and industrial coatings group sales in the textile and industrial coatings group decreased percent from the prior year 
the decrease resulted from volume shortfalls in the company s textile markets offset by increased volumes in the group s industrial specialty products and increased sales prices in the group s coatings products 
domestic textile mills demand has been lower due to an increase in imports and a general slowdown in the apparel markets 
in addition  the export of fabrics to asian and european countries slowed in the russian currency crisis and the european union furniture fabric tariffs all had negative revenue effects on this group 
operating income for the textile and industrial coatings group increased by million  or percent  in despite the slight reduction in sales due to reduced raw material pricing and other manufacturing cost efficiencies 
polymer additives and specialty plastics group sales in the polymer additives and specialty plastics group increased million  or percent  over the prior year 
sales volumes increased in the group s estane r thermoplastic polyurethanes tpu driven by strength in static control polymers and european tpu demand and telene r dcpd monomer markets but decreased in the group s temprite r high heat resistant plastics due to weakness in middle east markets as well as increased competition from other materials 
sales prices remained relatively stable with the exception of some polymer additives products used for the rubber and polymer industries and estane r tpu  where two competitors commissioned new us production facilities in operating income increased slightly over the prior year mostly as a result of increased volume and favorable raw material pricing 
consumer specialties group the million  or percent  increase in sales in the consumer specialties group was driven by increased volumes in the group s pharmaceutical and personal care products 
sales prices generally increased in all of the group s product lines 
the percent increase in operating income was mainly attributable to a favorable sales mix and higher volumes 
outlook the performance materials segment will face challenges in the asian economic downturn  other emerging market financial crises as well as adverse competitive pressures all combined to pose a challenging operating environment 
however  the segment expects demand to strengthen during the second half of and is optimistic about continued cost reduction benefits from acquisition integration and its process improvement and productivity programs 
in order to strengthen its customer and market focus  simplify its business structure and enhance productivity  the performance materials segment announced in february a realignment of business processes 
the realignment is expected to result in the elimination of approximately positions and is expected to result in annual cost savings of million 
the segment expects to obtain six months of these cost savings during the segment s textile and industrial coatings group enters with total domestic textile sales percent below levels  and united states textile exports approximately percent lower than levels 
the group expects to benefit from the continued integration of the segment s recent acquisitions during the polymer additives and specialty plastics group foresees moderate revenue increases in sales volumes in the group s estane r thermoplastic polyurethanes and telene r dcpd monomer markets are expected to grow in the group s temprite r high heat resistant plastic and polymer additives revenue base is expected to remain stable with limited growth in productivity improvements are expected to benefit operating income levels as well during the consumer specialties group expects to continue to benefit from strong growth in north america and foresees limited growth in asia  latin america and eastern europe over the short term 
the group also expects to benefit from acquisition integration synergies in compared to aerospace aerospace achieved sales growth of percent over sixty percent of aerospace s sales were to original equipment manufacturers  up from percent in the increase in original equipment sales was due to stronger demand for new commercial aircraft in the marketplace 
sales to civil aviation customers were percent of total aerospace sales in  compared with percent in military sales decreased to percent of aerospace sales  from percent a year earlier 
aerospace achieved a percent increase in operating income  despite a million charge related to the md program  a large increase in strategic sales incentives related to wheels and brakes  and an million bad debt write off due to a customer s bankruptcy and productivity problems in the mro group 
sales by group in millions aerostructures  landing systems sensors and integrated systems mro total   aerostructures group rohr the group s sales were  million in  a million  or percent  increase from contributing to increased sales were accelerated delivery rates on most commercial programs  reflecting increased production rates of commercial aircraft and increased deliveries of spare parts 
the cfm and v programs which power the a family  a  rr e primarily for the boeing  and md programs all reflected significant volume increases 
the aerostructures group operating income of million included a million pretax charge on the md contract 
operating income increased in primarily as a result of increased sales 
operating income of million in was adversely impacted by a million pretax impairment charge on the group s arkadelphia  arkansas  facility 
operating income in benefited from the recognition of profit on the md program md sales were million 
in  however  no profit was recognized on md sales totaling million  adversely affecting margins  in addition to the million pretax charge recognized on that program in  as discussed below 
in  the company entered into a contract with international aero engines to produce nacelles for the boeing company s formerly the mcdonnell douglas corporation s md aircraft 
under the terms of the contract  the company agreed to recover its preproduction costs  and the higher than average production costs associated with early production shipments  over a specified number of deliveries 
in light of the wide market acceptance of the md series  which was the predecessor aircraft  the company believed sufficient md aircraft would be sold to allow it to recover its costs 
starting in  a series of developments created market uncertainties regarding future sales of the md aircraft 
the most significant of these developments included mcdonnell douglas termination of the md xx program and the doubts this action raised regarding mcdonnell douglas continued presence in the commercial aircraft industry  the decision of several large airlines that had traditionally operated mcdonnell douglas aircraft to order aircraft that compete with the md  the announced and subsequently completed acquisition of mcdonnell douglas by boeing  which produces a family of competing aircraft  the announcement by delta air lines launch customer for the md of its intent to replace its existing fleet of md s and to seek a business resolution with mcdonnell douglas with respect to its remaining orders for the aircraft  and the lack of significant new md orders 
in recognition of these developments  the company reduced its estimates of future md aircraft deliveries in december to include only deliveries which were supported by firm orders  options and letters of intent for the aircraft 
based on its reduced estimate of future aircraft deliveries  the company believed that future md sales would not be sufficient to recover its contract investment plus the costs it would be required to spend in the future to complete the contract 
as a result  the company recorded a million pretax charge million after tax in december of this charge did not impact the income statement  rather  it was recognized as a direct adjustment to equity as a result of aligning rohr s fiscal year with bfgoodrich s 
in july  the company further reduced its market estimate of future md sales to existing firm aircraft orders excluding firm orders from delta air lines and recorded an additional million pretax charge million after tax  or 
per diluted share 
operating income loss by group in millions aerostructures landing systems sensors and integrated systems mro total landing systems group the group s sales were million  an increase of million  or percent  from the continued sales growth in primarily reflected higher original equipment volumes of landing gear and evacuation products and higher wheel and brake replacement sales 
landing gear programs providing the largest increased volume contribution included the b nose gear  b and md key evacuation systems programs included the b and the a aftermarket demand for commercial wheels and brakes was also strong  primarily for the b  b  b and a programs 
in addition  demand for regional  business  and military wheels and brakes significantly improved during the year  particularly for the f retrofit program 
the landing systems group achieved significantly higher operating income during the year  due primarily to greater sales of landing gear and evacuation slides to the original equipment market and more aftermarket sales of wheels and brakes 
this result was achieved by the group despite a three week strike at the landing gear business in the second quarter and substantially higher strategic sales incentive costs in the wheel and brake business 
operating margins operating income as a percent of sales declined modestly  reflecting the lower margins associated with original equipment sales relative to aftermarket sales and significantly higher strategic sales incentive costs 
sensors and integrated systems group the group s sales were million in  an increase of million  or percent  from the increased sales volumes of the sensors and integrated systems group reflected increased demand from commercial original equipment manufacturers for aircraft sensors  principally on the b and b commercial transport programs and the embraer and gulfstream gv regional and business jet programs 
stronger demand for aftermarket spares also boosted sales  particularly for aircraft sensors and aircraft fuel systems 
in addition  the group benefited from the march completion of the gulton data systems acquisition  a transaction which offset lost sales resulting from the engine electrical systems business divestiture in june gulton data systems sells products primarily to the space industry 
operating income for the group increased percent over results due to increased volumes of higher margin aftermarket spares that were sold to the commercial markets 
operating income improvement also reflects productivity initiatives  including business and plant consolidations 
in addition  the income contribution of gulton data systems more than offset the lost income from the divested engine electrical systems business 
operating margin by group aerostructures landing systems sensors and integrated systems mro total segment maintenance  repair and overhaul mro group the group s sales were million in  a decrease of million from sales declined modestly compared with  largely reflecting decreased sales volume in the component services business due to reduced demand from a major customer and  to a lesser extent  the bankruptcy of two customers early in the group s airframe business  however  posted higher sales during the year 
despite the negative effects of the ups strike during the summer of and productivity issues throughout the year  the airframe business achieved a percent sales growth 
this growth was due to increased demand for services from airline customers throughout the year and the addition of two new customers united and northwest airlines 
the mro group  however  recorded an operating loss in the group recognized an million bad debt charge related to all amounts receivable from western pacific airlines 
western pacific filed for chapter protection under the bankruptcy code last october 
on february   western pacific abruptly ceased its operations  resulting in the bankruptcy court ordering liquidation of the airline 
in addition to the western pacific matter  the airframe business continued to face challenges in retaining skilled technical workers  as competition for skilled workers significantly increased due to hiring at boeing and the airlines 
this resulted in higher costs for training new workers  lower productivity and higher wage and benefit rates for retained skilled workers 
although turnover of the labor force declined progressively during  turnover levels at year end were still higher than historical levels 
in addition  lower customer demand and higher operating costs in the component services business contributed to the operating income decline 
finally  the group s sales included approximately million of high margin product sales by the component services business which are not normally made by the service businesses 
performance materials sales increased percent in  to million 
excluding acquisitions  sales increased percent 
segment operating income increased percent  largely reflecting strong volume growth 
adverse foreign exchange effects tempered the segment s income growth  which would have been percent excluding the impact of the stronger us dollar 
the information has been reclassified from the two groups previously reported into the current three group structure of the segment 
sales by group in millions textile and industrial coatings polymer additives and specialty plastics consumer specialties textile and industrial coatings sales for the group increased by million  or percent  from million in to million in excluding the negative impact of a stronger dollar during  sales increased percent 
the increase in sales was attributable to increased volumes and prices across all product lines  especially in the coatings and industrial markets served by the group 
excluding acquisitions  sales increased by percent 
operating income increased percent during as compared to the increase in operating income was due to increases in volume and price as well as the impact of acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of a stronger us dollar 
excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange  operating income increased by percent 
operating income in millions textile and industrial coatings polymer additives and specialty plastics consumer specialties polymer additives and specialty plastics group sales in rose percent  from million in to million in  despite the stronger us dollar effects during the year 
adjusted for exchange rate changes  principally against european currencies  sales increased percent over solid volume gains in the group s temprite r high heat resistant plastics were achieved  most of which were in north america  while significantly higher volumes for estane r thermoplastic polyurethanes occurred in both north america and europe 
static control polymer sales growth was achieved in north america and asia 
was a transitional year for specialty plastics from an operating income perspective 
operating income growth of percent relating mostly to volume increases was offset principally by start up costs in connection with investments in domestic and global expansions in all divisions 
also  the negative foreign exchange impact of the stronger us dollar and higher raw material costs reduced operating income 
the group s operating income increased percent over without the foreign exchange impact 
operating income growth was achieved by the thermoplastic polyurethane business 
significant operating margin erosion occurred  however  in the high heat resistant plastics business  principally caused by the significant start up costs associated with the construction of two new european plants 
operating margin by group textile and industrial coatings polymer additives and specialty plastics consumer specialties consumer specialties group sales for the group increased by million  or percent  from million in to million in excluding the impact of a stronger dollar during  sales increased percent 
synthetic thickener sales for personal care  household and pharmaceutical applications in europe and asia were particularly strong 
selling prices were also generally higher across all product lines 
operating income increased million  or percent  from million in to million in driven by increased volumes and prices  as well as an improved sales mix 
these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of a stronger us dollar 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange  operating income increased percent
