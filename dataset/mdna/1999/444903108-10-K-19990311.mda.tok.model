year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such yk requirements 
since the company was founded in  most if not all of the company s computer equipment and software adopt modern design principles 
the company believes the majority of purchased computer systems  operating systems  and database management systems are ready for yk based on in house testing and information supplied by vendors 
for internal systems development  the company uses fully specified dates for all date items in the databases 
because these date representations have been built into systems from their inception  the company believes they should be fully yk compliant 
the company utilizes third party equipment and software that may not be yk compliant 
the company is concerned about the impact of the yk problem on suppliers  government agencies  electrical power  voice and data communications  shipping and other services required 
the company initiated a comprehensive program in october to identify risks  validate essential systems  confirm that vendor products are yk ready  and develop contingency plans to deal with problems that may arise 
a task force representing various departments in the company has been formed to carry out the company s yk program and is currently performing a comprehensive inventory of computer equipment  software and other devices that may have embedded microprocessors and software and is leading efforts to confirm that essential systems and suppliers are tested for correct yk behavior 
the company s contingency plans to address its concerns include building an inventory of key supplies and assuring that critical equipment has emergency backup power available 
the task force reports to the chief information officer on a regular basis 
the company plans to have substantially completed its yk assessment before june  the company does not believe that the cost of identification and correction of any yk compliance problems  estimated to be less than  will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results 
however  there can be no assurance that a failure of the company s internal computer systems  third party equipment  software used by the company  or systems maintained by the company s suppliers  to be yk compliant  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or operating results 
the company has not fully determined the risks associated with the reasonably worst case scenario and has not formulated a contingency plan to address the worst case year scenario
