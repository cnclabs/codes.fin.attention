item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  net sales 
net sales in were  a decrease of  or  from the  reported in this decline in revenue is attributable to production delays on three large military aerospace programs and  the technology transition created by the introduction of a revolutionary new family of dsp microprocessors from texas instruments 
historically  the company has supplied complex products to the military aerospace industry 
this complexity is necessitated by environmental conditions  space and weight constraints  and processing demands 
products of this nature inherently involve greater production risks since many components are only available from one supplier and relatively few subcontractors are available for final assembly 
specifically  during the second half of the company experienced supplier delays from vendors of printed circuit boards and memory devices 
additionally  production scheduled at one assembly contractor was also delayed by factors outside the company s immediate control 
all of these factors contributed to approximately million of shipment delays which impacted net sales in the company s focus on telecommunications products  which were not impacted by these production delays  will greatly reduce the company s dependence on complex military aerospace product sales 
as mentioned above  the second factor that led to the decline in net sales was the introduction in of the c family of dsp microprocessors from texas instruments ti 
historically  the majority of the company s products incorporate dsp s from ti 
the company believes the first release of the c dsp represented a x improvement in performance over the existing widely available dsp s 
commercial oems and defense contractors are now developing products that utilize these next generation dsps which  in turn  creates tremendous opportunities for the company in a number of emerging application areas such as wireless communications and internet telephony 
in the second half of  the company experienced a significant increase in customer orders for its c based comstruct line of telecommunications products 
published reports also indicate broad industry adoption of the c dsp in a wide variety of next generation telecommunication products 
the company s strong order flow from customers in the second half of coupled with the deferment of the delayed product shipments into led to a annual increase in order backlog as of june  order backlog as of june   was  as compared to  as of june  on a geographic basis net sales in north america were  in as compared to  in net sales to customers outside north america were  in as compared to  in the decline in north american sales is mostly attributable to the production delays described above and  to a lesser extent  the technology transition 
the decline in sales to customers outside north america can be attributed to the technology transition 
net sales from the company s non dsp products have continued to decline steadily and represented  or of net sales in  as compared to  or of net sales in gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in  as compared to in fiscal the increase in is the result of inventory provisions taken in related to product scrap and obsolescence 
a significant portion of the provision for product obsolescence in is related to the technology transition discussed above 
the company s gross margin percentage has varied each year  and each quarter  in both a positive and negative fashion due to factors mentioned above  and changes in customer and specific product mix 
such variations will continue to impact gross margin percentages in future reporting periods 
product development and engineering 
engineering expenses decreased to  or of net sales in  as compared to  or of net sales in the decline in absolute spending is the result of implementing the company s post merger organization plan immediately after the merger between mizar and loughborough sound images was completed in april duplicate development efforts were eliminated and the use of external contractors was reduced 
the post merger plan for the company also reflected a reduced level of new product development for the military aerospace industry and more stringent cost controls for discretionary spending items 
the company s telecommunications product development efforts now comprise over one half of the company s new product development effort 
the company believes that the focus on this vertical market will greatly expand its available served market during and beyond 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to  or of net sales  in  as compared to  or of net sales  in the company has continued to invest in new market development for its comstruct line of telecommunications products and for related application and technical support personnel 
the company has also employed additional sales personnel in the united states during general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  or of net sales  in  as compared to  or of net sales  in the reduction in absolute spending is the result of implementing the company s post merger organization plan immediately after the merger was closed in april the implementation of this plan included the elimination of duplicate functions and activities as well as stringent cost controls 
exclusive of a nonrecurring charge for separation agreements in  general and administrative expenses were reduced by from fiscal merger and realignment expenses 
in  the company provided for estimated costs and expenses associated with completing the merger and implementing the post merger organization plan 
as of the end of fiscal the company evaluated the adequacy of the original provision and determined that the estimate of the original provision was overstated by  or of merger and realignment expenses 
accordingly  this revision in estimate  primarily related to non cash charges  was reflected as a nonrecurring reduction in operating expenses in interest income 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal  as compared to  in cash reserves available for investment were greatly reduced near the end of and throughout as a result of the merger and realignment expenses and operating losses incurred in with respect to the merger  nonrecurring merger and realignment related expenses and the net cash used to redeem outstanding preference shares consumed over million in cash 
operating losses incurred in also contributed to the decline in the level of cash available for investment 
only an immaterial amount of cash payments related to the merger will be required in interest expense 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal  as compared to  in the increase in interest expense is the result of increased borrowings during the credit facilities utilized were with a commercial bank in the united kingdom and a commercial bank in the united states 
the increase in the average borrowing level was necessitated by the cash consumed by merger related expenses and transactions as well as the operating loss incurred in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  in  as compared to  in despite reported net losses the company did incur income related taxes in for state tax due in the us and federal tax due in france 
the provision relates to state tax due in the us and tax due in the uk 
the company recorded a valuation allowance on of the losses in due to the recent unfavorable operating results 
as a result of the significant net losses incurred in previous years  the company has accumulated a net operating loss nol carryforward  a portion of which was used to reduce the company s us federal income tax liability in fiscal years through pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  a change in ownership of the company greater than  as defined  within a three year period occurred twice  once in and once due to the merger with lsi in the company s us annual utilization limitation related to its nol carryforward is now the company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the net deferred tax asset of  recorded in the balance sheet as of june  and accordingly no valuation allowance has been provided on this portion of the asset 
this conclusion is based on changes in operations that have recently occurred  including the acquisition of lsi  which management believes will expand its product capabilities and customer base  cost reductions or synergies gained from the combination of mizar and lsi  the realignment of the company including its strategy to expand its markets in the telecommunications industry  the introduction of systems based upon the cx technology  limitation of the net operating loss carryforwards  as described above  related to the lsi merger  and projections of sufficient taxable us income to fully realize the net recognized deferred tax asset by the end of calendar year management continually evaluates the realizability of the net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on such assets

commercial oems and defense contractors are now developing products that utilize these next generation dsps which  in turn  creates tremendous opportunities for the company in a number of emerging application areas such as wireless communications and internet telephony 
however  many of these opportunities are at the expense of existing technologies that are available in plentiful supply 
published reports also indicate broad industry adoption of the c dsp in a wide variety of next generation telecommunication products

year initiatives the company has implemented a plan yk plan to attempt to assess and mitigate the potential impact of the year problem throughout the company 
this problem can arise when time sensitive embedded software utilizes a two digit year date field  sorting years beginning in before the year 
improper sorting can result in data corruption and processing errors 
this problem can be present in licensed software  software developed for internal use  software developed for customer use  and technology equipment 
additionally  year problems resident with key business partners to the company must also be identified and addressed 
the company is in the final stages of completing a detailed assessment of its products and internal systems 
the status of testing on the company s product range is available for customers on the company s web site and this details the year conformity status of individual products 
specific customer requests for year information are dealt with on an individual basis 
while the company is working closely with its suppliers of third party products to ascertain their status  the company cannot offer any assurances that these are year compliant and customers are advised to check with the appropriate third party 
the company s customers are informed that  in the majority of cases  blue wave products form only one component in a customer s system 
the company therefore advises its customers that it is their responsibility to ensure that their whole system is itself yk compliant 
from the company s detailed assessment of its internal systems  the company has instigated a replacement program for those limited portions of software used internally which were not year compliant 
the company believes this program will be complete in sufficient time before december  so that computer systems will function properly with respect to dates beginning in  and thereafter 
year compliance questionnaires have been sent to key suppliers and a monitoring process has been established to ensure the suppliers respond and comply with the requirements 
compliance testing of a substantial portion of the areas covered by the company s yk plan was completed by march  and areas tested required limited corrective action 
compliance testing of the remaining areas is scheduled for completion by october  any necessary corrective actions are scheduled for completion by november  the total year project cost is not expected to be material in relation to the company s financial position or results of operations 
although the company believes that its yk plan will adequately address the potential impact caused by the year problem  there can be no assurance that the company s yk plan will be sufficiently comprehensive or that it will be completed on a timely basis 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be yk compliant  or that a failure to convert by a supplier or customer  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse affect on the company 
if a key supplier or customer of the company fails to be yk compliant  the company could suffer a material loss of business or incur significant additional expenses or consume additional working capital
