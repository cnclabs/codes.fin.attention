item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a designer and manufacturer of telecommunications equipment supplied to telephone  cable television and power utility network providers worldwide 
the company sells its products directly to catv operators and telephone companies throughout the united states  canada  australia  united kingdom and certain other international markets  principally within developed nations 
the company believes that many of its customers periodically review their supply relationships  and the company can experience significant changes in buying patterns from specific customers between fiscal periods 
the company has historically operated with a relatively small backlog  and sales and operating results in any quarter are principally dependent upon orders booked and products shipped in that quarter 
further  the company s customers generally do not enter into long term supply contracts providing for future purchase commitments for the company s products 
these factors  when combined with the company s operating leverage and the need to incur certain capital expenditures and expenses in part based upon the expectation of future sales  results in the company s operating results being at risk to changing customer buying patterns 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet the company s expectations  operating results for that period may be materially and adversely affected 
the company uses numerous raw materials in its manufacturing processes 
although management believes that the company has adequate sources of supply for such raw materials  increases in the market prices of the company s raw materials could significantly increase the company s cost of goods sold and materially adversely affect the company s profitability 
the company s profitability may also be materially adversely affected by decreases in its sales volume because many of the costs associated with the company s rent  product development  engineering  tooling and other manufacturing processes are fixed in nature and must be spread over its sales base in order to maintain historic levels of profitability 
in addition to company manufactured products  the company markets complementary products manufactured by third parties 
with respect to sales of cable in conduit products  the company generally received a commission upon the sale of such products 
pursuant to the agreement  which was terminated in  under which the company marketed such products  during the terms thereof and for a period of two years thereafter  both the company and the manufacturer of such products is prohibited from competing with the other in any product line that is  or within the year prior to termination has been  represented  manufactured or sold by the other within the specified markets covered by the agreements 
during the periods discussed under results of operations below  the company s sales increases resulted primarily from additional sales to the company s existing customers as they expanded  rebuilt and upgraded their signal delivery networks in order to deliver enhanced communications services  as well as additional sales to new customers  particularly telephone companies that have recently entered the catv market  international customers  and through the rms  standby electronics and egerton acquisitions 
results of operations the following table sets forth the company s operating results for the periods indicated expressed as a percentage of sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit commission income selling general and administrative license fees research and development income from operations interest income expense  net income before income taxes pro forma income taxes pro forma net income adjusted income from operations 
pro forma income taxes and pro forma net income have been determined giving effect to the termination of the company s s corporation status in july actual income tax expense has been reflected for the last six months of and for all of and see note to selected financial data 
adjusted income from operations has been determined giving effect to the transactions described in notes and to selected financial data 
adjusted financial data is not applicable for and new accounting pronouncement in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is effective for sfas will require the company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives that are hedges  changes in the fair value of derivatives will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments 
the company believes the impact of adopting this standard will not be material to results of operations or equity 
comparison of the year ended december  with year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million or from million in to million in  as a result of increased sales of telecommunication enclosure and component products of million including million of egerton products and million of other related equipment 
domestic net sales increased million or from million in to million in  primarily due to accelerated growth in both upgrade and rebuild construction as a result of increased broadband requirements 
international net sales increased million or from million in to million in  due to the sales of million of egerton products while channell s broadband sales decreased million due to the sluggish asian economy 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or from million in to million in of this improvement  million is attributable to sales of egerton products and million was attributable to increased sales volume of channell s telecommunications enclosure and component products 
gross margin decreased from in to in  primarily due to a margin contribution from egerton revenues  while margin on channell s telecommunications enclosure and component products decreased from in to in due to increased depreciation expenses from capital expenditures in the comparative periods and increased manufacturing staffing 
commission income 
commission income decreased million or from million in to million in the decrease is a result of the termination of a marketing agreement for the sale of cable in conduit products 
selling 
selling expense increased million or from million in to million in  as a result of million for increased payroll and related expenses in connection with expanded staffing to support increased sales and marketing activities worldwide and million of increased selling expenses related to the egerton operations 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expense increased from in to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million or from million in to million in such increase occurred as a result of increased payroll and related expenses due to increased staffing requirements in the amount of million and million of increased legal  auditing and professional services 
general and administrative expense increased million as a result of the egerton operations including million of goodwill amortization 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in research and development 
research and development expenses increased million or from million in to million in  as a result of increased payroll and expenses in the amount of million associated with increased staffing and million related to egerton 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased from in to in income from operations 
as a result of the items discussed above  income from operations increased million or from million in to million in  but declined as a percentage of net sales from in to in interest income expense 
interest income decreased from million in to million in  a reduction of 
this decrease was caused by a reduction in the amount of the company s investments in  as the company used approximately million of its investments to fund the purchase of egerton 
interest expense increased from million in to million in as a result of increased borrowings to fund the egerton acquisition and capital expenditures 
income taxes 
income taxes were million in and million in  with effective tax rates of and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the increase in the amount of non deductible amortization of goodwill 
comparison of the year ended december  with the year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased million or from million in to million in catv net sales increased million or from million in to million in as a result of the sales of million of rf passive electronic devices by rms  million of channell proprietary products due to moderate growth from system upgrade and new network construction projects worldwide  and million of standby electronics metal enclosures 
telecommunications net sales increased million or from million in to million in  as a result of increased activity in sealed plant products 
the company has historically provided a breakdown of sales to the catv and telephone industries based on product sales  ie  each product has been traditionally purchased by one or the other industry 
with the gradual convergence of the two industries  an industry breakdown based on product sales becomes less valid each year as telephone companies purchase equipment heretofore purchased only by catv companies and vice versa 
management believes continuation of an industry sales breakdown based on product sales would be misleading and has decided that all future reports and publications will combine these two market segments under the title telecommunications 
domestic net sales increased million or from million in to million in this increase was a result of the sales of million of rf passive electronic devices and million of channell proprietary products due to moderate system upgrade and new network construction growth 
international net sales increased million or from million in to million in  primarily due to the sales of million of rf passive electronic devices and million of metal enclosures 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or from million in to million in million of this improvement is attributable to the sales of rf passive devices  million was attributable to increased volume of channell proprietary products  and million was attributable to the sales of metal enclosures 
gross margin decreased from in to in primarily due to a and margin contribution from the sales of rf passive devices and metal enclosures  respectively 
gross margin on channell s proprietary products decreased from to during the comparable periods primarily due to increased depreciation expense from capital expenditures in the comparative periods and increased manufacturing staffing 
commission income 
commission income decreased million or from million in to million in  due to a decrease in sales of cable in conduit products as a result of aggressive pricing by competition and lower sales in the eastern part of the united states due to severe winter weather conditions during the first quarter of selling 
selling expense increased million or from million in to million in  primarily as a result of million of increased sales and marketing expenses related to the rms and standby electronics subsidiaries  and million for increased payroll and related expenses in connection with expanded staffing to support increased sales and marketing activities worldwide 
the increased selling expenses discussed above were offset by the salary and expenses of an officer now being classified as general and administrative expenses due to expanded responsibility 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expense decreased from in to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million or from million in to million in such increase occurred primarily as a result of increased payroll and employee benefits in the amount of million due to increased staffing in the administrative and information systems departments as a result of rms and standby electronics operations  as well as the reclassification of the salary of an executive officer 
travel  legal  auditing and professional services increased million as a result of being a publicly traded company for a full year in as compared to having such status for six months in depreciation  insurance and facilities expense increased million as a result of the rms acquisition 
computer hardware and software expenses increased million as a result of the installation of a new management information system mis platform 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in license fees 
license fees decreased million in as a result of the termination of the channell patents during research and development 
research and development expenses increased million or from million in to million in  primarily as a result of increased payroll and expenses associated with increased staffing 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased from in to in income from operations 
as a result of the items discussed above  income from operations was million in both and  but declined as a percentage of net sales from in to in income taxes 
income taxes increased million from million in to million in the increase is principally due to the termination of the s corporation status as a result of the initial public offering  at which time the company recorded deferred tax assets on its balance sheet with a corresponding credit to its income tax expense 
since the initial public offering  the company pays federal and state income taxes as a c corporation 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the cost of acquisitions  net of cash acquired  used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities was million in and net cash provided by financing activities was million in  including million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
accounts receivable increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   as a result of higher sales during the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period of and million attributable to egerton operations 
inventories increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   as a result of increased work in process and finished goods inventories required for the increased sales volume forecasted and million attributable to egerton operations 
the company made capital expenditures excluding capital leases of million and million in and  respectively  including million to acquire a  square foot building adjacent to its existing facilities in temecula  california  which will be used for metal fabrication  tool and die production and research and development 
the company acquired machinery and equipment under capital leases totaling million in and million in the board of directors  on april   having determined such action to be in the best interest of the company  authorized a stock repurchase plan of up to million worth of company stock 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately million 
the company on may   acquired of the outstanding shares of common stock of egerton  a public limited company incorporated in england and wales 
the purchase price  paid in cash  amounted to million  including million of acquisition costs 
the fair value of assets acquired in excess of liabilities assumed amounted to million which resulted in goodwill in the amount of million 
goodwill is being amortized on the straight line basis over twenty years 
the purchase price of the stock was paid from the proceeds of bank borrowing and the liquidation of short term investments 
in conjunction with the acquisition of egerton  the company entered into a new senior revolving loan agreement revolving facility with a bank to provide funds for the egerton acquisition as well as for working capital and equipment acquisition purposes 
the revolving facility is in the amount of million of which million had been drawn down as of december  the outstanding balance bears interest at a variable rate based on either the bank s base rate or the applicable libor rate depending on the nature of the borrowings 
at december   the weighted average interest rate was 
the loan is collateralized by substantially all the company s tangible and intangible assets and up to of the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and is due april  the revolving facility contains various financial and operating covenants which  among other things  imposes limitations on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  merge or consolidate  sell assets except in the ordinary course of business  make certain investments  enter into leases and pay dividends 
the company is also required to comply with covenants related to minimum net worth and other financial ratios 
the company also has a credit facility available to the egerton subsidiaries  which includes an overdraft facility totaling approximately million plus the combined cash balances of those subsidiaries  which were approximately million at december  the facility also includes approximately million  to provide financing for international letters of credit  forward exchange contracts and other items 
the outstanding balance net of cash balances bears interest at the bank s base rate  at december   plus a factor ranging from to a maximum of depending on the amount borrowed 
the facility is collateralized by the assets of the subsidiaries and due for renewal in august the company believes that income from operations  coupled with borrowing under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company s capital expenditure and working capital requirements through forward looking statements this report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are being provided pursuant to that legislation 
in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business 
the following is not intended as  and should not be considered  an exhaustive list of relevant factors 
obsolescence  uncertainty of market acceptance of new products today s communications industry is in a state of rapid technological change 
the introduction of new technologies  network architectures or changes in industry standards can render the company s existing products or products under development obsolete or unmarketable 
for example  satellite  wireless and other communication technologies under development or currently being deployed may represent a threat to copper  coaxial and fiber optic based systems by reducing the need for wire line networks 
to date  however  the company believes that these technologies have not had a significant impact on the demand for traditional wire line network based services 
further  management anticipates that a number of factors  including network capacity requirements  existing investments in wire line networks  security and long term cost effectiveness  will result in continued growth of wire line networks 
however  there can be no assurance that future advances or further development of these or other new technologies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s growth strategies are designed  in part  to take advantage of opportunities that the company believes are emerging as a result of the development of enhanced voice  video  data and other transmission networks  and high speed internet access in the telecommunications industry 
there can be no assurance that demand resulting from these emerging trends will develop rapidly or that the company s products will be met with market acceptance 
importance of new product development to growth a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and remain competitive  will be its ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards  and to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
new product development often requires long term forecasting of market trends  development and implementation of new designs and processes  and substantial capital commitment 
trends toward consolidation of the communications industry and convergence of technologies may require the company to quickly adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and customer requirements 
the company s manufacturing and marketing expertise has enabled it to successfully develop and market new products in the past 
however  any failure by the company to anticipate or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to technological developments or changes in industry standards or customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
concentration of customers  limited backlog the telecommunications industry is concentrated  with relatively few operators accounting for a large percentage of the company s available market 
consequently  while the company shipped product to over  customer locations in  its five largest customers by sales volume accounted for of the company s total net sales in two customers  media one and time warner  accounted for and  respectively  of the company s total net sales during the period 
the company s customers typically require prompt shipment of the company s products within a narrow timeframe 
as a result  the company has historically operated with a relatively small backlog 
sales and operating results in any quarter are principally dependent upon orders booked and products shipped in that quarter 
further  the company s customers generally do not enter into long term supply contracts providing for future purchase commitments for the company s products 
these factors  when combined with the company s operating leverage see operating leverage below and the need to incur certain capital expenditures and expenses in part based upon the expectation of future sales  may place the company s operating results at risk to changing customer buying patterns 
if sales levels in a particular period do not meet the company s expectations  operating results for that period may be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on the communications industry the company expects that sales to the telecommunications industry will continue to represent a substantial portion of its total sales 
demand for products within this industry depends primarily on capital spending by cable operators for constructing  rebuilding  maintaining or upgrading their systems 
the amount of capital spending and  therefore  the company s sales and profitability  are affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  access by cable operators to financing  government regulation of cable operators  demand for cable services and technological developments in the broadband communications technology 
although local telephone operators may have greater access to capital than many cable operators  the same factors dictating the demand for products in the catv segment of the industry also apply to the local telephone customers 
thus  the company s success is dependent upon continued demand for products used in signal transmission systems from the communications industry generally  including both catv and telephone  which may be affected by factors beyond the company s control  including the convergence of video  voice  and data transmission systems occurring within the catv and telephone markets  continuing consolidation of companies within those markets and the provision of internet access by cable operators and local telephone companies 
price fluctuations of raw materials  availability of complementary products the company s cost of sales may be materially affected by increases in the market prices of the raw materials used in the company s manufacturing processes  including resins 
the company does not engage in hedging transactions for such materials  although it periodically enters into contracts for certain raw materials for as much as one year or more 
there can be no assurance that price increases in raw materials can be passed on to the company s customers through increases in product prices 
in addition  in order to position itself as a full line product supplier  the company relies on certain manufacturers to supply products that complement the company s own product line  including grade level boxes 
although the company believes there are multiple sources of supply for these products  disruptions or delays in the supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the company s own products 
acquisitions and failure to integrate acquired businesses one of the company s principal strategies is to increase its revenues  earnings per share and the markets it serves through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and acquire attractive acquisition candidates  profitably manage such acquired businesses or successfully integrate such acquired businesses into the company without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  including but not limited to  adverse short term effects on the company s reported financial condition or results of operations  diversion of management s attention  dependence on retention  hiring and training of key personnel  risks associated with unanticipated problems or liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results or operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that businesses acquired in the future will be profitable at the time of acquisition or that the businesses recently acquired or acquired in the future will achieve sales and profitability justifying the company s investment therein or that the company will realize the synergies expected from such acquisitions 
the failure to obtain any or all of the desired results from these acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
impact of operating leverage in the event of sales decline because the related fixed costs for rent  product development  engineering  tooling and manufacturing are a relatively high percentage of total costs  the company s ability to maintain its historic profitability is dependent on generating a sufficient volume of product sales  thereby spreading fixed costs over the sales base 
due to this operating leverage  a reduction in sales or the rate of sales growth could have a disproportionately adverse effect on the company s financial results 
seasonality and fluctuations in operating results the company s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the first and fourth quarters generally reflecting lower sales due to the impact of adverse weather conditions on construction projects that may alter or postpone the needs of customers for delivery of the company s products 
the company s operating results may also fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to several other factors  including the volume and timing of orders from  and shipments to  major customers  the timing of new product announcements and the availability of products by the company or its competitors  the overall level of capital expenditures by catv operators and local telephone companies  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  variations in the mix of products the company sells  and the availability and cost of raw materials 
risks associated with international operations international sales  including export sales from us operations  accounted for  and of the company s net sales in   and respectively  and the company expects that international sales may increase as a percentage of sales in the future 
due to its international sales  the company is subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuations in the us dollar which could materially adversely affect us dollar revenues or operating expenses  tariffs and other barriers and restrictions  potentially longer collection cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes and the burdens of complying with a variety of international laws and communications standards 
the company is also subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  in connection with its international operations 
there can be no assurance that these risks of conducting business internationally will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
competition the industries in which the company operates are highly competitive 
further  because of the anticipated growth in the telecommunications industry generally  the demand for products required in signal transmission networks in particular  the level and intensity of competition may increase in the future 
the company s competition includes a company that has a significant market share in the telephone segment of the industry 
the company s strategy includes continued focus on increasing sales to this segment 
while the company s net sales to this segment have increased  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against that company or other competitors  many of whom may have access to greater financial resources than the company 
disruptions at the company s manufacturing facility  lease with related party the majority of the company s manufacturing operations is currently located at the company s facility in temecula  california  which also includes the company s principal warehouse and corporate offices 
the company s success depends in large part on the orderly operation of this facility 
because the company s manufacturing operations and administrative departments are concentrated at this facility  a fire  earthquake or other disaster at this facility could materially and adversely affect its business and results of operations 
the company maintains standard property and earthquake insurance on this facility as well as business interruption insurance and back up data systems 
the company currently leases a portion of its temecula facilities from william h 
channell  sr  a principal stockholder and chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company 
the company believes the terms of these leases are no less favorable than would be available from an unrelated third party after arm s length negotiations 
although the company has renewal options through the year under these leases  there can be no assurance that the company and mr 
channell  sr 
will be able to agree on renewal options for the properties currently leased by the company 
the failure of the company to renew the leases would require the company to relocate its existing facilities  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
year computer systems compliance the year problem concerns the inability of certain computers and computer systems to process data beyond january  many software programs refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
these programs may interpret the year as and may not recognize that the year is a leap year 
the year was not a leap year 
if not corrected  these programs could shut down or generate incorrect critical data 
the company has developed a plan to deal with the year issues that it faces 
the company  independent of the year issues has embarked on a worldwide project to implement a new business information system throughout the company using i rhythm factory planner  oracle erp software and associated hardware 
these new systems will make the company s business information systems approximately year compliant and are scheduled for completion domestically in the second quarter of and internationally in the third quarter of the company is on schedule for implementation of these new systems 
in addition to business information systems  the company s plan calls for the analysis  correction and testing of embedded systems which might not operate or might not operate properly after january  those systems include  but are not limited to  telephone and voice mail systems  manufacturing and production equipment  freight and shipping software  office machines  elevators and building security systems 
the company has completed of the in house testing and or obtaining of manufacturer s certifications for the year compatibility of these systems 
any items that cannot be determined to be compliant or cannot be upgraded to be compliant are being replaced if they are deemed to be critical to the operations of the company 
the company s plan also includes a procedure for analyzing the year status of key outside suppliers  service providers and customers whose failure to comply could have an adverse affect on the company 
these procedures include a standard year compliance agreement as well as a survey type questionnaire designed to help measure the vendor s progress in dealing with the year issues 
the company has identified its key vendors and customers and has completed of the process of mailing the questionnaire and or obtaining the certification agreements 
this phase of the plan is on going  but is anticipated to be complete in the third quarter of the company has contingency plans to deal with the failure of the above to meet the year issue with regard to the systems upgrade 
the contract with the suppliers includes a guarantee that the new systems will be implemented and tested timely  and that the systems will be year compliant 
in addition  in the event that the business information system implementation oracle does not meet the project time line  the company will install yk patches for its existing data general operating system along with the apollo business application software 
this will ensure  on a short term basis  that the company will continue in a production environment while meeting the year compliance situation 
no contingency plan has been established to deal with the embedded systems issue in that any critical  non compliant systems will be replaced or corrected as they are discovered 
contingency plans to deal with outside suppliers and customers will be developed as indicated by the on going analysis of these entities 
such contingency plans could include the building of inventories  the search for alternative suppliers  or the request for advance payments or deposits from customers  all as the case may indicate 
the total costs associated with becoming year compliant are not expected to be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
total costs associated with the business information systems project are expected to be million  most of that attributable to the systems upgrade that was being done independent of the year problems 
approximately of the costs associated with the systems upgrade have already been incurred 
failure to anticipate and correct the year problem could result in an interruption in or a failure of certain normal business activities including  but not limited to temporary plant closings  delays in the delivery of products  delays in receipt of supplies  invoice and collection errors  delays in the collection of receivables and inventory obsolescence 
the company believes that with the implementation of the new business information systems and completion of the other procedures contained in the year plan particularly the analysis of third party vendor and customer year compliance activities  that any significant interruptions and negative impacts from year problems will be reduced 
dependence on key personnel the future success of the company depends in part on its ability to attract and retain key executive  engineering  marketing and sales personnel 
key personnel of the company include william h 
channell  sr  the chairman of the board and chief executive officer  william h 
channell  jr  the president and chief operating officer  and the other executive officers of the company 
competition for qualified personnel in the communications industry is intense  and the loss of certain key personnel could have a material adverse affect on the company 
the company has entered into employment contracts with mr 
channell  sr 
and mr 
channell  jr 
changing regulatory environment the communications industry is subject to regulation in the united states and other countries 
federal and state agencies regulate most of the company s domestic customers 
on february   the united states congress passed the telecommunications act of the telecommunications act  which the president signed into law on february  the telecommunications act lifts certain restrictions on the liability of companies  including rbocs and other customers of the company  to compete with one another and liberally reduces the regulation of the communications industry 
while the company believes that the deregulation of the communications industry may increase the company s opportunities to provide for its customers signal transmission network needs  the effect of the telecommunications act on the market for the company s products is difficult to predict at this time  and there can be no assurance that competition in the company s markets will not intensify as a result of such deregulation 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could materially adversely affect the company s business 
uncertain ability to manage growth  risks associated with implementation of new management information system the growth in the company s business has required  and is expected to continue to require  significant company resources in terms of personnel  management and other infrastructure 
the company s ability to manage any future growth effectively will require it to attract  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  to integrate new employees into its overall operations and to continue to improve its operational  financial and management information systems 
in  the company intends to complete the implementation of a new management information system mis 
the company believes the new mis will significantly affect many aspects of its business  including its accounting  operations  purchasing  sales and marketing functions 
the successful implementation of this system will be important to the company s provision of services and to facilitate future growth 
if the company is not successful in implementing its mis or if the company experiences difficulties in such implementation  the company could experience problems with delivery of its products or an adverse impact on its ability to access financial and accounting information on a timely basis 
environmental matters the company is subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and uses a limited number of chemicals that are classified as hazardous or similar substances 
although management believes that the company s operations are in compliance in all material respects with current environmental laws and regulations  the company s failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company 
selected quarterly financial data set forth below is certain unaudited quarterly financial information 
see also footnote p to the financial statements included elsewhere herein 
the company believes that all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly  and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with the financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitivity instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
all financial instruments held by the company and described below are held for purposes other than trading 
market risk the company s revolving line of credit allows the outstanding balance to bear interest at a variable rate based on either the bank s base rate or the applicable libor rate depending on the nature of the borrowings 
the revolving line of credit exposes earnings to changes in short term interest rates since the interest rates on the revolving line of credit are variable 
if the variable rates on the company s revolving line of credit were to increase by from the rate at december   and the company borrowed the maximum amount available under its revolving line of credit million for all of fiscal  the company s interest expense would increase  and net income would decrease by million 
if libor were to increase from the rate at december   and the company borrowed the maximum amount available  the company s interest expense would increase  and also net income would decrease by million 
a marginal income tax rate of was used 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
in the event of a change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
foreign exchange risk the company typically does not hedge its foreign currency exposure 
management does not believe it currently has any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
