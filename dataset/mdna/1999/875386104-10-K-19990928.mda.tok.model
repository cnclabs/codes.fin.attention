results of operations the following tables present selected financial data for each of the company s four product divisions for the years ended june   and fiscal years ended june  and dollars in thousands increase decrease operating operating income income operating divisions sales loss sales loss sales income frames and wall decor     office supplies     home furnishings  gifts    divested operations    restructuring charge  total operations  excluding corporate     fiscal years ended june  and dollars in thousands increase decrease operating operating income income operating divisions sales loss sales loss sales income frames and wall decor     office supplies     gifts   divested operations    total operations  excluding corporate     fiscal years ended june  and in fiscal consolidated net sales decreased  or  compared to fiscal excluding divested operations  net sales increased  or  compared to the prior year 
the sales increase can be attributed to the company s consolidation of cargo furniture and accents cargo in february and sales increases at the frames and wall decor and office supplies divisions  partially offset by declines in the gifts division 
the company suffered an operating loss for the year primarily as a result of the closure of the tandy leather retail stores and manufacturing operations  poor performance of the licensed product line of the gift division including impairment losses recognized for certain long lived assets  and performance under the cargo bank debt guarantee 
discussions relative to each of the company s product divisions are set forth below 
frames and wall decor net sales for the frames and wall decor division  which operates under the pinnacle art frame name  increased during fiscal the sales growth can be attributed to solid market acceptance of pinnacle s new plastic frames and an increase in mirror sales 
partially offsetting these increases was a decline in sales of framed art caused by a large framed art customer changing their framed art program from an everyday item to a promotional item 
looking forward  we expect sales improvements to continue in the plastic products and a rebound in framed art sales based on expected increases with existing customers and the exit of a major competitor in the framed art market during fiscal pinnacle s operating income increased by  during fiscal and maintained the operating margin of net sales achieved in fiscal the increase in operating income results from the sales increase as well as improved gross margins 
gross margin as a percentage of sales improved by because of lower lumber prices in the current year and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of sales increased by as a result of start up expenses associated with the new production facility in mexico  increased expenditures in marketing and product development and expansion of the sales and service organization to support the growth in business with major customers 
we project pinnacle s profitability to be negatively impacted in fiscal by the direct costs associated with the relocation of framed art production from california to mexico and the excess capacity which will be experienced while operating both the california and mexico plants during the transition period 
we plan to have the transition substantially complete by march  and expect operating margins to begin improving in late fiscal office supplies net sales of the office supplies division  which is comprised of the store sav on office supplies chain  increased in fiscal the sales increase resulted from a increase in same store sales and a increase in sales at non comparable stores 
competition continued to impact sales growth as stores saw their first or second large competitor enter their market during fiscal historically  sav on stores are significantly impacted the first twelve to fifteen months after a large competitor enters a market  however  after the second year  stores typically begin producing sales gains 
as all but five of sav on s stores face at least one and many face two major competitors  sav on s exposure to competitive invasions has lessened 
sav on s operating income was up slightly from the prior year 
gross margins fell slightly during fiscal primarily as a result of stronger back to school promotions and competitive pricing pressures 
partially offsetting these declines in margin was the impact of a new direct import program which showed promising initial results in fiscal sg a expenses increased by  but decreased slightly as a percent of sales as a result of more efficient advertising programs and more efficient labor scheduling 
management plans to expand the direct import program in fiscal in response to continued competitive price pressures 
gifts sales for the gifts division  comprised of licensed lifestyles  inc  rivertown button company and j mar associates  decreased  or  from fiscal  of the decline is attributable to sales losses of licensed products 
management has continued to see weak demand for licensed products  especially for sports licensed products which have historically represented the vast majority of licensed lifestyles sales 
in addition to the general soft market for licensed goods  licensed lifestyles traditional customer base of sporting goods retailers continued its trend of consolidation or elimination in fiscal negatively impacting sales 
sales at j mar were also down as a result of new product introductions in fiscal occurring late in the fiscal year  whereas  the fiscal new products were introduced in the beginning of that fiscal year 
we expect the gifts division to introduce a number of new non licensed products in fiscal which should contribute to a change in the sales trend of this division  however  as the demand for licensed products will likely remain soft  sales may remain flat or decline in fiscal the gifts division had an operating loss of  in fiscal versus a loss of  in the prior year 
the loss is comprised of an impairment of long lived assets loss of  discussed below  and a loss from operations of  the operating loss can be primarily attributed to a write down of inventory  a decrease in sales and increased product development costs 
during fiscal  licensed lifestyles recognized a  loss related to the write down of certain inventory items to their net realizable values 
this write down was primarily triggered by management s decision to discontinue several underperforming licensed product lines within the division resulting from continued softness in licensed product sales 
as a result of three consecutive years of operating losses and declining sales  as well as the recent industry wide weakening of licensed product sales  the company performed an analysis of the recoverability of the net book value of the long lived assets of licensed lifestyles  inc  its wholly owned licensed products subsidiary 
through this assessment  management determined that the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from these assets were less than their net book value 
these long lived assets were then written down to their estimated fair value based upon a valuation analysis performed by an independent third party valuation firm  resulting in an impairment loss of  approximately   of this charge related to the write down of goodwill and  related to the write down of property  plant and equipment 
despite the losses sustained in fiscal  this division s new management team made significant progress in reducing the level of sg a expenses and improving operational controls and buying practices 
as such  despite the uncertain sales levels of fiscal  management expects this division s operating income performance to improve in fiscal home furnishings in october  the company was informed that cargo furniture and accents cargo  a former subsidiary of the company  had obtained a financial advisor for the purpose of actively pursuing additional capital to expedite the chain s conversion of their mall based furniture stores to their new  higher performing cargo collection store concept 
at that time  cargo had opened eight of the cargo collection stores and seen promising results 
however  due to cargo s limited capital resources and the poor performance of their mall based stores  cargo determined that it required additional capital to complete the conversion process 
in december  cargo informed the company that it was unable to obtain additional investment capital 
in addition  it was probable that cargo would be in default of certain covenants contained in their bank term note agreement  and that cargo would not be able to cure the events of default 
the company had guaranteed cargo s term note  and had additional amounts receivable from cargo 
on january   the company was informed by cargo s lender that cargo had defaulted on its term note and that cargo s lender required the company to perform pursuant to its guaranty of the note 
on february   the company complied with the lender s request 
as a result of cargo s poor financial condition  the company determined that recovery of the  note balance and the receivables from cargo was not probable 
consequently  loss provisions of  were recorded during the quarter ended december  and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a result of making the guaranty payment  the company had the option to obtain a majority of cargo s common stock  thereby obtaining voting control of cargo 
accordingly  the company began to consolidate the results of operations of cargo effective february   recording its assets and liabilities at their estimated fair market value at that date 
on june   the company completed the foreclosure of cargo and acquired ownership 
during the last five months of fiscal while the company was consolidating cargo in its financial statements  cargo had sales of  and incurred an operating loss of  the majority of the loss is due to transaction related costs and continued poor performance of the mall based stores 
in fiscal  the company intends to convert the remaining mall based stores to the new collection format 
in addition  the product distribution and delivery processes have been re engineered resulting in a more cost effective distribution system which should yield favorable results in fiscal divested operations divested operations in fiscal consist primarily of the leather and crafts retail stores and related manufacturing operations for which a plan of closure was approved in the second quarter of fiscal the sales and operating income for divested operations for fiscal also includes joshua s christian stores  which the company sold effective may  in fiscal  net sales of the leather and crafts operations decreased  or

in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of better than expected inventory liquidation sales   of the inventory write down was reversed and credited to cost of sales 
approximately  of the charges related to the write down of non inventory assets and anticipated future cash outlays and is classified as restructuring charge in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
included in the  restructuring charge is approximately  related to non cash write downs of non inventory assets to their estimated net realizable value  including  related to the write off of goodwill   related to the write down of fixed assets primarily comprised of store fixtures and leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment substantially all of which have been abandoned  and  related to the write down of various other assets 
the remaining restructuring charge of  represents an accrual for anticipated future cash outlays for lease obligations and other related exit costs 
as of june   the lease agreements for stores had been terminated through settlement  sub let or assignment 
subsequent to june   six more leases have been settled 
all of the manufacturing operations have been closed 
the following table sets forth the activity in the restructuring reserve  which is included in current accrued liabilities in the june  balance sheet in thousands december  cash june  payments lease obligations   other the above provisions are estimates based on the company s judgment at this time

please refer to the discussion of risk factors contained herein 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting guidelines for derivatives and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for the company beginning in fiscal the company is analyzing the implementation requirements and does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa issued statement of position  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop requires that an entity only capitalize those costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use that were incurred in the development and implementation stages 
costs incurred during the conceptual formulation stage and training costs are expensed as incurred 
sop becomes effective for the company july   however  the company s current policy falls within the guidelines of the statement  thus  the company does not anticipate any impact from adopting this statement 
the year the company has a comprehensive project year project designed to minimize or eliminate business disruption caused by potential processing problems associated with the year issue 
the year project  which addresses both the company s information technology it systems and non it systems  consists of three phases identification and analysis  planning  implementation and testing 
the company s year project has used both internal and external resources 
the first phase of the company s year project involved identifying and analyzing the it and non it systems that the company believed were susceptible to failures or processing errors as a result of the year issue 
this phase consisted of the company and its operating units identifying the systems that required remediation or replacement 
through its systems requirements study  the company believed that  with regard to it systems  five should be remediated through replacement and three remediated through upgrades 
with respect to non it systems  the company believed that there was an insubstantial susceptibility to the year issue 
this phase has been completed 
the second phase of the year project involved analyzing proposed remediations and planning how to implement such remediations 
the company then established priorities for remediation 
this phase has been completed for it systems 
the third phase of the year project involved implementing the proposed remediations 
with regard to it systems  all five replacements have been substantially completed 
two of the three upgrades have been substantially completed with the last upgrade in process and scheduled to be substantially completed by the end of october testing of the remediations is in process and further remediation efforts may be required thereafter to address year issues discovered during testing 
further  the company acquired the assets of cargo furniture and accents cargo late in fiscal during its due diligence and since its acquisition  the company identified and analyzed the systems of cargo that the company believed were susceptible to failures or processing errors as a result of year issues 
the company then analyzed proposed remediations and planned how to implement such remediations 
the company is currently in the process of implementing year ready systems at cargo and currently believes that this process will be substantially completed by november  additionally  as part of its year project  the company has identified certain service providers  vendors  suppliers  and customers key partners that it believes are critical to business operations after january  the company initiated communications with such key partners in an attempt to reasonably ascertain their state of year readiness 
the company has received responses to approximately of these questionnaires 
the majority of such responses indicated that the key partner had year remediation programs and expected to be compliant by at least calendar year end the company has sent follow up inquiries to the key partners who have not responded to the company s questionnaire 
the company plans to continue assessment of key partners  which may include further communications  interviews and face to face meetings  as deemed appropriate 
in addition  the company has implemented a year ready electronic data interchange edi system and is in the process of working with its business partners to convert them over to this system 
despite the company s efforts  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies which the company relies upon to conduct its operations and business will be year compliant 
in addition to the above measures  the company is developing contingency plans intended to mitigate the possible disruption in business operations from the year issue 
the company intends to continue to evaluate and modify contingency planning as additional information becomes available 
the company estimates that the costs of the year project will range from million to million 
as of june   the company had spent approximately million 
the cost estimates do not include any costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans and any potential costs related to any customer or other claims relating to the year issue 
because of the large number of systems used by the company  the significant number of service providers  vendors  suppliers and customers  and the interdependent nature of systems  there can be no guaranty that the company will not experience some disruption in its business due to the year issue 
although it is not currently possible to quantify the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  the possible consequences of the company or key partners not being fully ready in a timely manner include without limitation temporary plant closings  delays in the delivery of products  delays in the receipt of supplies  invoice and collection errors and inventory and supply obsolescence 
consequently  the business and operations of the company could be materially adversely affected by a temporary inability of the company to conduct its business in the ordinary course for periods of time due to the year issue 
however  the company believes that its year project and related contingency planning should reduce the adverse effect any such disruptions may have 
the year project is an ongoing process and the risk assessments  estimates of costs  projected completion dates and other factors are forward looking statements and are subject to change 
risk factors that may cause actual results to differ from estimates or projections include without limitation  the continued availability of qualified personnel and other information technology resources  the ability to identify and remediate all date sensitive lines of computer code and embedded chips  the timely receipt and installation of year ready replacement systems and upgrades  the actions of governmental agencies  utilities and other third parties with respect to the year issue  the ability to implement contingency plans  and the occurrence of broad based or systemic economic failures 
contingencies a former subsidiary of the company  which was spun off in  filed for chapter protection under the federal bankruptcy code in january as part of the bankruptcy proceedings  the former subsidiary has rejected certain store leases which were originated prior to the spin off and for which the company was allegedly a guarantor 
an accrual for claims associated with the alleged guarantees on leases rejected as of june  has been established 
based on the information presently available  management believes the amount of the accrual at june  is adequate to cover the liability the company may incur under the alleged guarantees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates in the united states 
the company manages interest rate risk through the strategic use of variable rate debt and interest rate derivatives 
as of june   the company had only entered into one interest rate derivative  thus  the table presents the notional amount and interest rate of this derivative instrument categorized by expected maturity date 
the counterparty to the derivative agreement is a major financial institution 
the company believes the risk of credit loss with this institution is minimal
