the company s primary cash requirements in fiscal will be to finance capital expenditures in connection with the opening of new restaurants  remodeling of existing restaurants  maintenance expenditures  point of sale upgrades and the reduction of debt under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company s capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to range from  to  during the first quarter of fiscal the company purchased a loan for  from texas commerce bank national association in satisfaction of its obligations under a loan guaranty see note 
the purchase of the loan was financed through borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
during fiscal  the company anticipates opening two to four burger king restaurants and one full service restaurant 
the actual amount of the company s cash requirements for capital expenditures depends in part on the number of new restaurants opened and the actual expense related to remodeling and maintenance of existing units

 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe the reporting and display of comprehensive income will materially impact the financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
this statement is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after december  in the initial year of application  comparative information for earlier years is to be presented 
this statement need not be applied to interim financial statements in the initial year of its application  but comparative information for interim periods in the initial year of application is to be reported in financial statements for interim periods in the second year of application 
the company will adopt sfas no 
for its fiscal financial statements 
during  statement of position reporting on the costs of start up activities was issued  broadly defining costs related to start up activities and requiring these costs be expensed as incurred 
the company has historically capitalized these costs and expensed them over the first year of operations of the store 
the company plans to adopt this statement of position for fiscal year and does not expect the resulting change to have a significant impact on results of operations 
impact of year the term year is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery and equipment as the year is approached and thereafter 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software has historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s 
the company s state of readiness 
the company has established a formal plan year plan to i test its information technology systems to evaluate year compliance  ii assess the year compliance of its information technology vendors  iii assess its non information technology systems that utilize embedded technology such as micro controllers and iv determine the readiness of third parties such as government agencies  utility companies  telecommunication companies  suppliers and other non technology third party vendors 
the company has completed the testing and assessment of its information technology systems including non information technology systems that utilize embedded technology 
the company has determined that of its critical systems were year compliant by december  and anticipates that the remaining critical systems will be year compliant by june  independent of the company s year plan  the company has previously determined it would replace its point of sale equipment in as many as of its full service dining restaurants 
this determination was part of the company s ongoing efforts to enhance financial controls through a centralized  computerized  accounting system to enhance the tracking of data to enable the company to better manage its operations 
the company is currently in the process of replacing the point of sale equipment in its full service restaurants and expects to complete this process by august  the replacement systems will be year compliant 
the company expects the replacement of the point of sale equipment in its full service restaurants to cost approximately million 
the company anticipates incurring non cash charges of approximately  to  in connection with the disposition of certain of its point of sale equipment 
the company has determined that its point of sale equipment in its burger king restaurants is year compliant 
costs to address the company s year issues 
the company expenses costs associated with its year plan as the costs are incurred except for costs that the company would otherwise capitalize 
the company does not expect the costs associated with its year plan to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
the company is unable to estimate the costs it may incur as a result of year problems suffered by third parties with which it deals 
the company has surveyed its critical vendors  other than utilities and government agencies  and believes that each vendor will either be year compliant by june  or  if not  suitable alternative suppliers that are year compliant will be available 
risks presented by year problems 
to operate its businesses  the company relies upon government agencies  utility companies  telecommunications companies  suppliers and other third party service providers over which it can assert little control 
the company s ability to conduct its business is dependent upon the ability of these third parties to avoid year related disruption 
if they do not adequately address their year issues  the company s business may be materially affected which could result in a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
if the company is not able to integrate replacement point of sale systems at its full service restaurants  its ability to effectively operate those restaurants could be substantially impaired 
as a result of the company s ongoing assessment  the company may identify additional areas of its business that are at risk of year disruption 
the absence of any such determination at this point represents only the current status of the assessment phase of the company s year plan and should not be construed to mean that there are no other areas of the company s business which are at risk of a year related disruption 
the company s contingency plans 
the company s year plan calls for the development of contingency plans for areas of its business that are susceptible to a substantial risk of a year related disruption where the company determines that such disruption could be mitigated through reasonable  cost effective contingency plans 
the company has not yet developed detailed contingency plans specific to year events for any specific area of business 
consistent with its year plan  the company will develop specific year contingency plans for such areas of business as and if such determinations are made 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
increases in labor  food  and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operating procedures or increase menu prices to substantially offset increases in its operating costs 
many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
although the company has been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at the company s restaurants 
this report contains certain forward looking statements  including statements about the company s development plans  that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following the availability and cost of suitable locations for new restaurants  the availability and cost of capital to the company  the ability of the company to develop and operate its restaurants  the hiring  training and retention of skilled corporate and restaurant management and other restaurant personnel  the integration and assimilation of acquired concepts  the overall success of the company s franchisors  the ability to obtain the necessary government approvals and third party consents  the ability of the company to modify or redesign its computer systems to work properly in the year  and changes in governmental regulations  including increases in the minimum wage
