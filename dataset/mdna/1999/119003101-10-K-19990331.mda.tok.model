general prior to the acquisition of bracc  we were the largest budget franchisee in the united states and were one of the largest independent retailers of late model automobiles in the united states 
in  we embarked on a strategy to significantly expand our budget franchise base and to develop a branded retail car sales operation within our budget franchise territories 
beginning in  we began acquiring and expanding into other rental related businesses 
this strategy both leveraged management s experience and created certain operating efficiencies between these complementary businesses 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the pooling of interests with cruise america  inc as if the companies had combined at the beginning of the first period presented 
the results of operations reported herein include the acquired operations of the phoenix budget franchise  van pool services and valcar rental car sales  inc from their respective acquisition dates 
the results of operations of budget group for include the operations of bracc from april  the results of operations reported herein also include the acquired operations of premier car rental from july  and the budget franchise in st 
louis from september  in connection with the bracc acquisition  we changed our name from team rental group  inc to budget group  inc 
in june  we acquired ryder trs 
the results of operations reported herein also include the acquired operations of three new car dealerships effective in june for a further discussion of these transactions  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
we are engaged in the business of the daily rental of vehicles  including cars  trucks  passenger vans and recreational vehicles through both owned and franchised operations and the sale of new and late model used vehicles including recreational vehicles

retail vehicle sales revenue generated from the sales of new and late model used vehicles including recreational vehicles 
royalty fees and other fees generated from our licensees and other non vehicle rental or sales items

depreciation  vehicle depreciation expenses relating to revenue earning vehicles including net gains or losses on the disposal of such equipment 
cost of retail vehicle sales cost of new and late model used vehicles sold at retail or from retail lots including recreational vehicles 
selling  general and administrative includes reservation  advertising  marketing and other related expenses  net of third party reimbursements  and commissions to travel agents and other third parties 
amortization and non vehicle depreciation includes amortization of goodwill and other intangibles as well as depreciation of capitalized assets

income before extraordinary item for decreased million to a loss of million from income of million in the income before extraordinary item per share for decreased to a loss of 
per diluted share from income of per diluted share in due to the decrease in earnings partially offset by an increase in the average number of shares outstanding 
income before income taxes decreased million in to million from million for income before income taxes reflects debt extinguishment costs of million in largely for class a common stock issued to induce conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes 
we also recognized an extraordinary loss of million  net of income tax benefits  in related to the early extinguishment of guaranteed senior notes and ryder trs s senior subordinated notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
ryder trs contributed approximately million in earnings before taxes for the seven months ended december  operating revenues 
vehicle rental revenue increased million in to  million from  million in this increase was largely due to the full year impact of bracc s operations  acquired in the second quarter of  and the ryder trs acquisition in the second quarter of  which added a significant number of locations and vehicles to our operations 
revenue from sales of vehicles increased million in to million from million in this increase was due to the addition of bracc s car sales operations  new stores opened by us  and the acquisition of three new car dealerships in june royalty fees and other revenues increased million in to million from million in these revenues largely represent royalty and other fees from our franchisees as a result of the bracc acquisition and revenue from ryder trs s move management service 
ryder trs contributed million in total revenue and million of royalty fees and other revenues 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased  million in to  million from  million in this increase was also largely due to the addition of bracc s and ryder trs s operations to our operations 
ryder trs s operating expenses totaled million in direct vehicle and operating expenses reflect a reduction in insurance reserves of approximately million in this reduction was due to changes in actuarial estimates of losses based on continued favorable trends in the frequency and severity of accidents as well as changes in claims handling procedures implemented within the past months 
excluding the insurance adjustment and the impact of ryder trs  direct vehicle and operating expenses increased slightly as a percent of vehicle rental revenue due to increases in vehicle damage  reconditioning expenses and mileage related penalties of approximately million on an annualized basis 
the increases in reconditioning and mileage related penalties occurred largely in the latter part of due to changes in terms of certain manufacturer s buyback programs 
the cost of retail vehicle sales increased million in to million from million in this increase is reflective of the vehicle sales revenue growth with the addition of bracc s car sales locations  the new car dealership acquisitions and new locations opened by us 
due to weaknesses in used car demand  gross margins from vehicle sales declined in compared to the decrease in margins along with startup costs for new locations largely contributed to operating losses of million in as compared to a loss of million in for the retail car sales segment 
we expect to suspend the expansion of car sales locations through mid to focus on improving the results of under performing stores 
the retail car sales operating loss in includes an impairment loss of million related to long term assets of which million represented goodwill 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in to million from million in this increase was also largely due to the addition of bracc s and ryder trs s operations to our operations and also includes a provision of approximately million for bad debts in related to collection inefficiencies brought about by centralization efforts largely in international administrative functions 
amortization and non vehicle depreciation expense increased million in to million from million in this increase was largely due to intangibles  including goodwill  and property and equipment related to the acquisitions of bracc and ryder trs and the previously referred to impairment loss 
we recorded restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of of million largely related to severance and related costs and location closing expenses and incurred million in expenses related to our merger with cruise america 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense 
other expense  net of interest income  increased million in to million from million in this increase was due to the financing of fleet and other borrowings related to the acquisitions of bracc and ryder trs  net of investment income due to the increase in restricted cash  and million in debt extinguishment costs related to the conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
the tax provision differs from the statutory rate largely due to the effect of the distributions on trust preferred securities shown below the provision at its gross amount while the tax benefit is included in the provision and changes in valuation allowances somewhat offset by the effects of non deductible intangible amortization and the impact of state and local income taxes net of the federal benefit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
distributions on trust preferred securities 
the distributions on trust preferred securities of million represents dividend payments to holders of these company obligated mandatorily redeemable securities issued by a subsidiary of budget group 
these distributions are reflected as a minority interest under the above mentioned caption 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  general operating results 
net income for increased million to million from million in diluted earnings per share for increased to per share from 
per share in income before income taxes increased million for to million from million for operating revenues 
vehicle rental revenue increased million in to  million from million in this increase was due primarily to the acquisition of bracc which added over locations and over  vehicles to our operations in the us revenue from the sales of vehicles increased million in to million from million in this increase was due primarily to the addition of bracc s car sales locations as well as new stores opened by us 
royalties and other revenues totaled million in and largely represent royalty and other fees due from our franchisees as a result of the bracc acquisition 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million in to  million from million in this increase was largely due to the addition of bracc s operations to our operations 
the cost of vehicles sold increased million in to million from million in this increase is reflective of the car sales revenue growth with the addition of bracc car sales locations and new locations opened by us 
selling  general and administrative expenses in includes a million one time charge to establish an accrual for damages 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization and non vehicle depreciation expense increased million in to million from million in this increase was largely due to property and equipment and intangibles  including goodwill  related to the acquisition of bracc 
changes from to in the percent of revenue for expense categories are largely attributable to the increase in vehicle rental operations resulting from the acquisition of bracc 
other income expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased million in to million from million in this increase was due to the financing of fleet and other borrowings related to the bracc acquisition  net of investment income due to the increase in restricted cash 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased million in to million from million for the tax provision reflects a full year effective rate of which is higher than the statutory rate largely due to the effects of non deductible intangible amortization and the impact of state and local income taxes net of the federal benefit 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our operations have been funded by cash provided from operating activities and by financing provided by banks  automobile manufacturers captive finance companies  leasing companies and asset backed notes 
our primary use of cash is the acquisition of new vehicles for the rental fleet 
the indebtedness at december  has interest rates ranging from to and the material terms of the financing facilities are described below 
we intend to fund operations and debt maturities through asset backed notes and revolving credit facilities with financial institutions for fleet financing and working capital  as well as through other similar facilities and through placements or offerings of additional equity and or debt securities which may include a substantial portion of unsecured indebtedness 
analysis of cash flows net cash provided by operating activities increased to million during from million during net cash provided by operating activities during increased from million during in each period  we experienced increases in cash received from rentals which were offset to some extent by increases in cash paid to vendors and employees and in interest expense 
net cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to cash paid to suppliers of revenue earning vehicles and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
this cash use is mainly offset by cash received from the sale of vehicles most of which sales were pursuant to manufacturers vehicle repurchase programs 
cash received from the sale of vehicles was  million   million and million during  and  respectively 
cash paid to suppliers of revenue earning vehicles was  million   million and million during  and  respectively 
the increase in cash paid to suppliers of revenue earning vehicles during was primarily the result of the increased number of vehicles in service during largely due to the acquisitions of bracc and ryder trs 
payment for acquisitions  net of assets acquired  amounted to million  million and million during  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  largely for new rental locations  improvement in service levels and to upgrade computer hardware and software were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities for increased to million during from million during  due primarily to the proceeds received from the issuance of asset backed medium term notes mtn s and the trust preferred securities  which was partially offset by the utilization of these proceeds to repay existing vehicle and non vehicle debt of budget group and ryder trs  as described under recent debt placements and retirements below 
net cash provided by financing activities during increased to million from million in  due primarily to the proceeds received from the issuance of class a common stock  unsecured notes and mtn s in connection with the bracc acquisition 
debt facilities general we borrow money directly and through our special purpose fleet financing subsidiaries  team fleet financing corporation tffc and budget fleet financing corporation bffc 
subsidiaries also have various working capital facilities in place to finance operating activities 
at december   we had  million of indebtedness outstanding   million of which represented secured fleet financing and million of which represented non vehicle indebtedness 
at december   we had million of availability under various fleet financing facilities 
recent debt placements and retirements concurrent with the closing of the ryder trs acquisition  we implemented a number of changes to our capital structure 
these changes included i the amendment and restatement of our existing million secured revolving credit facility to increase such facility to million  ii the conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes to class a common stock  iii the redemption of million of guaranteed senior notes  iv the issuance  by a subsidiary  of  shares of trust preferred securities which raised approximately million  net of related fees  v the private placement of billion of tffc notes  vi the redemption of million of ryder trs s outstanding senior subordinated notes and vii the repayment of approximately million of ryder trs s outstanding commercial paper 
the redemptions early extinguishments resulted in charges totaling million  after income tax benefits  and the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes resulted in charges of million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
fleet financing facilities at december   we had borrowed billion under asset backed mtn s and million under a commercial paper cp facility collectively fleet notes 
the mtn s are comprised of notes issued in august tffc notes  notes issued in december tffc notes  notes issued in april tffc notes  notes assumed in the bracc acquisition bffc a notes  and notes issued in conjunction with the acquisition of ryder trs tffc notes 
the fleet notes are utilized largely to finance vehicles eligible for certain manufacturers vehicle repurchase programs and other allowable cars and trucks 
proceeds from the fleet notes that are temporarily unutilized for vehicle financing are maintained in restricted cash accounts with the trustees 
the fleet notes are collateralized by the secured vehicles and the restricted cash accounts 
interest rates on the fleet notes at december   range from to 
our other vehicle obligations consist of outstanding lines of credit to purchase rental fleet and retail car sales inventory 
borrowings under collateralized available lines of credit at december   consist of million for rental vehicles and million for retail car sales inventory with maturity dates through may vehicle obligations are collateralized by revenue earning vehicles financed under these credit facilities and proceeds from the sale  lease or rental of rental vehicles and retail car sales inventory 
interest payments for rental fleet facilities are due monthly at annual interest rates that range from to at december  management expects that vehicle obligations will generally be repaid within one year from the balance sheet date with proceeds received from either the repurchase of the vehicles by the manufacturers in accordance with the terms of the manufacturers vehicle repurchase programs or from the sales of the vehicles 
medium term notes the billion tffc notes were entered into concurrently with the acquisition of ryder trs  require monthly interest payments and bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
the tffc notes mature in from three to seven years 
proceeds from the notes were used to refinance ryder trs s commercial paper and to finance certain bracc vehicles 
the million tffc notes and cp facility were entered into concurrently with the bracc acquisition 
as of december   the cp has various interest rates  which ranged between and 
the tffc note facility requires monthly interest payments at an annual rate ranging from to 
the tffc notes and tffc notes totaled million with interest rates ranging from to at december  monthly maturities on the tffc notes of million commence in june  with the last payment in november  while subordinated tffc notes of million are payable in full in december we expect to fund these maturities through the issuance of term notes  both secured and unsecured  beginning in early april we have continued to utilize borrowings under the bffc a notes to fund our fleet 
the bffc a notes consist of million of senior notes requiring monthly interest payments at libor plus at december  
monthly maturities of million commence in april  with the last payment due in september we expect to fund these maturities through the issuance of term notes  both secured and unsecured  beginning in early april trust preferred securities in june  budget group capital trust  one of our subsidiaries  issued million of trust preferred securities and received approximately million in net proceeds 
these funds were used to redeem the guaranteed senior notes and to partially fund the redemption of ryder trs s senior subordinated notes which occurred in july the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon the redemption of the underlying debentures due on june  we have the right to defer interest payments due on the subordinated debentures for up to consecutive quarters which will also cause a deferral of distributions under the trust preferred securities 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
working capital facility concurrent with the acquisition of ryder trs  we entered into an amended and restated secured credit facility to increase its size from million to million 
this facility requires monthly interest payments on the outstanding balance at a rate based on libor plus or prime plus or at december  and expires in the facility is secured primarily by cash  accounts receivable and vehicles and is subject to certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum tangible net worth and restrict the payment of cash dividends 
at december   we had million in letters of credit and million of debt outstanding under this facility 
the credit facility was amended in the first quarter of to  among other things  modify certain financial covenants and permit the issuance of additional unsecured term notes to fund the maturities of mtn s 
change in financial condition total assets increased  million to  million at december   from  million at december  this increase  largely revenue earning vehicles of million and intangibles of million  resulted primarily from the acquisition of ryder trs  which had million in vehicles and million in intangibles at december   and increases in revenue earning vehicles at bracc reflecting new locations opened or acquired as well as growth in truck rental volume 
restricted cash increased million largely as a result of issuing the previously mentioned mtns 
property and equipment  net increased by million due to investments in vehicle rental and sales locations and the acquisition of ryder trs 
this investment activity is expected to slow in the first half of total liabilities increased by million to  million at december  from  million at december  this increase  largely notes payable of million  resulted primarily from the acquisition of ryder trs and the issuance of the mtns 
budget group capital trust issued the trust preferred securities  amounting to million at december   in june which partially funded the early redemptions of debt previously mentioned 
inflation the increased acquisition cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting our operations 
many of our other operating expenses are inflation sensitive with increases in inflation generally resulting in increased costs of operations 
the effect of inflation driven cost increases on our overall operating costs is not expected to be greater for us than for our competitors 
seasonality generally  in the vehicle rental industry  revenues increase in the spring and summer months due to the overall increase in business and leisure travel during this season 
we increase the size of our fleet and workforce in the spring and summer to accommodate increased rental activity during these periods and decrease our fleet and workforce in the fall and winter 
however  many of our operating expenses such as rent  insurance and administrative personnel are fixed and cannot be reduced during the fall and winter 
as a result of these patterns  for vehicle rental  the first quarter of each year is typically the weakest and the third quarter is typically the strongest 
the retail car sales business is also subject to seasonal effects  with lower sales during the winter months 
year issue we have assessed and continue to assess the impact of the year yk on our reporting systems and operations the yk issue 
the yk issue exists because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the century date occurs  certain date sensitive systems will recognize the year as the year or may not recognize the date at all 
this inability to properly treat or recognize the year may cause computer systems and applications to process critical information incorrectly 
during and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively  in expenses to modify existing computer systems and applications and estimate that an aggregate of approximately million will be incurred in specifically for yk modification 
the most significant systems undergoing or to undergo modifications are the reservation and rental transaction processing systems 
a failure in these systems could cause significant disruption in customer service levels and therefore materially impact our operating results and financial condition 
we are using both internal and external resources and expect to complete all major modification efforts by mid with some projects extending into late these efforts have not significantly hampered our ongoing system development or system upgrade activities to date  however  all available resources will be diverted to yk efforts in the event that modifications fall behind schedule 
we are assessing the impact of the yk issue on the ability of our significant suppliers and vendors to maintain adequate service levels 
responses have been received from approximately of the significant vendors identified by us with all respondents indicating expected readiness for yk 
the most critical suppliers and vendors are in the vehicle manufacturing  telecommunications  fuel supply and banking financing industries 
a failure on the part of these suppliers and vendors or their products could cause significant disruption in operations and therefore materially impact our operating results and financial condition 
we believe that the computer technology embedded in the vehicles we have in fleet  or expect to purchase  is yk ready and expect to complete the entire assessment by mid there can be no assurance that the critical third party suppliers upon which we rely will be successful in taking corrective action in a timely manner 
we are developing contingency plans with respect to certain areas which are intended to allow us to continue to operate in the event of a yk failure 
the contingency plans will include performing certain processes manually  repairing affected systems and changing suppliers and vendors as necessary 
these contingency plans may not be successful in avoiding the disruption of service particularly in the reservation and vehicle rental processes 
environmental matters we have assessed and continue to assess the impact of environmental remediation efforts on our operations 
our exposure largely relates to the clean up and replacement of underground gasoline storage tanks 
during  we recognized approximately million in expenses related to remediation efforts and estimate that an aggregate of approximately million will be incurred in and based on past experience  management expects these estimates will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements 
however  due to factors such as continuing changes in the environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and changes in the extent of expected remediation efforts  estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainty and it is difficult to predict the amount or timing of future remediation requirements 
risk factors we had a net loss for we incurred a net loss of million for this net loss included i an extraordinary charge of million after tax relating to retirements of indebtedness and ii one time restructuring and other non recurring charges of million after tax 
we have experienced net losses in the first quarters of the past two years  primarily as a result of seasonal factors  and anticipate that we will have a net loss for the quarter ending march  in  we had a loss before income taxes of million in our car sales segment 
we are evaluating various alternatives relating to budget car sales to restore its profitability  including franchising stores  closing stores  working with a strategic partner to manage stores and other measures 
we cannot assure you that our losses will not continue in the future 
our business is highly seasonal our business is highly seasonal  particularly the leisure travel and consumer truck rental segments  and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
historically  revenues have been stronger in the third quarter due to the overall increase in business and leisure travel during the peak summer travel months and the increase in moving activity during this period 
the first quarter is generally weakest  when there is limited leisure travel and a greater potential for adverse weather conditions 
the third quarter accounted for of total revenue and of operating income for and of total revenue and of operating income for any occurrence that disrupts travel patterns during the summer  or any adverse competitive conditions during this period  may materially adversely impact our annual operating performance 
our business practice is to increase the size of our vehicle fleet and workforce during the spring and summer months to accommodate increased activity during these periods and to decrease our fleet and workforce in the fall and winter months 
however  many of our operating expenses such as rent  insurance and administrative personnel are fixed and cannot be reduced during the fall and winter months when there is decreased rental demand 
if we are unable to manage successfully the size of our vehicle fleet and workforce during periods of decreased business activity  our annual operating performance may be materially adversely affected 
our business is highly competitive there is intense competition in the vehicle rental industry particularly with respect to price and service 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with either existing or new competitors 
in any geographic market  we may encounter competition from national  regional and local vehicle rental companies 
our main competitors in the car rental market are alamo  avis  enterprise  hertz and national 
in our truck rental business  we face competition primarily from penske and u haul 
many of our competitors have larger rental volumes  greater financial resources and a more stable customer base than we have 
in the past  we have had to lower our rental prices in response to industry wide price cutting and have been unable to unilaterally raise our prices 
moreover  when the car rental industry has experienced vehicle oversupply competitive pressure has intensified 
the retail car sales industry is also characterized by intense competition  consisting primarily of local new car dealerships selling new and late model used cars 
in addition to local dealerships  we may face competition from retailers such as carmax and autonation 
these retailers compete on the basis of large inventory size  no haggle pricing and after sale service 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively in the retail care sales industry 
we have not completed the integration of our recent acquisitions our recent growth has been largely attributable to two major acquisitions the bracc acquisition in april and the ryder trs acquisition in june we have devoted significant resources to the combination and integration of our previously existing operations with bracc and our budget truck rental business with ryder trs  and these efforts are ongoing 
completing the integration of these acquisitions with our other businesses and achieving the anticipated levels of cost savings involves a number of risks that could affect our operating results 
these risks include a the difficulty of managing a significantly larger organization  b the diversion of management s attention from other business issues  c the difficulty of integrating different distribution and marketing systems  which include independent dealers  franchisees and corporate owned operations  d the risk that the financial and accounting systems utilized by the acquired businesses may not be efficiently integrated into our own systems  e the difficulty of attracting and retaining qualified personnel to manage the combined business  and f dealing with potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses  which liabilities may not have been disclosed and may exceed the amount of indemnification available from the sellers 
integration of these acquisitions has required significant investments to build management and infrastructure to support our combined business operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully realize the benefits that we anticipated from any acquired operations or to manage effectively the combined business 
an inability to do so could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be obligated to deliver a make whole payment in connection with the ryder trs acquisition  we issued  shares of class a common stock  paid million in cash  issued warrants to purchase class a common stock with a value of up to approximately million and are obligated to deliver a make whole payment with respect to the shares of class a common stock issued in the acquisition to the extent  if any  that the class a common stock trades below approximately per share over two day measurement periods ending  respectively  on june  and february  this make whole payment may be made in cash and or stock  at our option 
this payment would  if made in cash  divert cash from other business purposes 
we are dependent on third parties for financing we depend on third party financing to fund our purchases of fleet vehicles 
accordingly  the availability of financing on favorable terms is critical to our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all 
a majority of our debt is incurred in connection with manufacturers vehicle repurchase programs 
as a result  significant changes in the credit programs of the vehicle manufacturers  particularly ford motor company  could significantly affect our ability to obtain this financing on favorable terms 
in addition  certain events  such as significant increases in the damage to vehicles  could reduce the value of the collateral securing our vehicle financing facilities and cause the acceleration of the repayment of such debt 
our inability to obtain vehicle financing on favorable terms would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we cannot assure you that the sources of financing used in the past will remain or that alternative financing will become available on terms acceptable to us 
we are dependent on a principal supplier ford motor company has been and continues to be our principal supplier of vehicles 
under the terms of our supply agreement with ford  we have agreed that in the united states  canada  and other countries outside the european union our leases and purchases of ford vehicles will represent at least of the total new vehicle acquisitions by us  with a minimum purchase requirement of at least  vehicles in the united states in each model year 
shifting significant portions of our fleet purchases to other manufacturers would require significant advance notice and operational changes 
also  there can be no assurance that vehicles would be available from other suppliers on competitive terms  if at all 
as a result  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if ford is unable to supply our vehicles or if there is any significant decline in the quality and customer satisfaction with ford vehicles 
changes in manufacturers repurchase programs may affect our business our ability to resell our vehicles at a favorable price and fix our depreciation expense in advance is dependent upon the terms of manufacturers repurchase programs 
as of december   of our vehicle fleet was covered by these programs 
our ability to sell vehicles under manufacturers repurchase programs limits the risk of decline in residual value at the time of disposition and enables us to fix a substantial portion of our depreciation expense in advance 
vehicle depreciation is the largest expense in our vehicle rental operations 
in the past  automobile manufacturers have changed the terms of these programs by  among other things  reducing the number of vehicles that can be sold under their repurchase programs  reducing related incentives  increasing guaranteed depreciation and reducing the mileage allowed on program vehicles 
we could be adversely affected if our vehicle suppliers make these or other adverse changes in their repurchase programs 
we may be adversely impacted by litigation with our former german franchisee in october  we discontinued providing services to our german franchisee such as reservations and credit card processing services  after having previously terminated the related franchise agreements for alleged contract violations 
this franchise termination is being contested by the franchisee in the german courts and has not yet been resolved 
as a result of this development  we have experienced an adverse effect on our business in  and originating from  germany  and this adverse effect may continue 
we intend to replace the current franchisee with a new franchisee and or corporate owned locations when these legal issues are resolved 
however  there is no assurance that the court s ruling will allow us to replace the current franchisee or that such replacement will be commercially successful 
our operations and financial performance are affected by various types of regulations we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations that affect the conduct of our operations 
these laws and regulations cover matters such as the sale of loss damage waivers  vicarious liability of vehicle owners  consumer protection  advertising  used vehicle sales  the taxing and licensing of vehicles  franchising operations and sales  and environmental compliance and clean up  particularly with regard to our substantial on site use and storage of petroleum products 
we cannot assure you that compliance with these laws and regulations or the adoption of modified or additional laws and regulations will not require large expenditures by us or otherwise have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations may be subject to additional risks our international operations are subject to adverse developments in the foreign political and economic environment  varying governmental regulations  foreign currency fluctuations  potential difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potential adverse tax consequences 
we cannot assure you that these factors will not have a significant effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our recent investments and cost cutting initiatives may not be successful during  we expended significant capital resources on several initiatives designed to increase our revenue and reduce our costs  and these initiatives will continue during we expect to realize certain cost savings and other operating efficiencies during as a result of these and other initiatives that will be implemented in major areas in which we will seek to reduce our operating expenses  as well as the major assumptions we have made in estimating our cost savings include i reductions in administrative  personnel and overhead expenses  ii improvements in operations and consolidations of our reservations centers  iii improvements in our car rental field operations to increase vehicle utilization  iv improvements in vehicle maintenance procedures  v increased efficiencies in non vehicle purchasing  and vi reduction of vehicle carrying costs through renegotiation of manufacturers vehicle repurchase agreements 
our ability to achieve the cost savings mentioned above is inherently uncertain 
we may not be able to successfully implement these initiatives  cost increases in other areas may offset the effect of these measures  implementation of these measures may initially lead to additional costs  and events beyond our control may cause us to otherwise fail to succeed in our cost cutting plans 
in addition  it is always possible that the implementation of our cost cutting initiatives could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful at growing our business or realizing the cost savings that these initiatives were intended to achieve 
our business may be adversely affected by the potential failure of computer systems to recognize the year we are dependent on business systems that may be affected by year problems 
the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications and non computer systems that utilize computer technology currently use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as the year approaches  certain date sensitive systems will recognize the year as the year or may not recognize the date at all 
this inability to properly treat or recognize the year may cause certain systems to process critical information incorrectly  including our reservations and rental processing systems 
a failure in these systems could cause significant disruption in customer service levels and therefore materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we incur costs of upgrading these systems to be year compliant that are significantly in excess of expectations  our operating results will also be adversely affected 
we are also assessing the impact of the year issue on the ability of our significant suppliers and vendors to also maintain adequate service levels 
we cannot assure you that we or the third party suppliers on whom we rely will be successful in addressing year problems in a timely manner  if at all  or that our contingency plan will be successful in avoiding the disruption of service 
for further discussion of the year issue  see the section above in this item entitled year issue 
our founders have substantial stockholder voting power a large portion of the voting power of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of three individuals  sanford miller  john p 
kennedy and jeffrey d 
congdon 
these individuals own all outstanding shares of class b common stock 
each share of class b common stock entitles its holders to ten votes per share  while our class a common stock entitles holders to one vote per share 
the class b common stock beneficially owned by messrs 
miller  kennedy and congdon  together with the class a common stock owned by these individuals  represents approximately of the combined voting power of both classes of common stock 
as a result  these three individuals are able to exert substantial influence over the election of our board of directors along with other matters put to a stockholder vote 
this increases the probability that members elected by them will continue to direct our business  policies  and management 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness we maintain a substantial amount of secured indebtedness to finance our fleet purchases 
at december   we had billion of total outstanding indebtedness  of which billion was secured 
we had million of unsecured indebtedness at december   and stockholders equity of million at that date 
notwithstanding our capacity to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness  our substantial indebtedness could have negative consequences for our business  including the following a limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  b limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to debt service  c limiting our flexibility in reacting to changes in our industry and changes in market conditions  d increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business  and e increasing our interest expense due to increases in prevailing interest rates  because a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient earnings or to borrow sufficient funds to cover our debt service obligations 
if for any reason we are in default under the terms of our indebtedness  the holders of our indebtedness will be able to declare all this indebtedness immediately due and payable and terminate their commitments  if any  with respect to additional funding obligations 
such holders could also proceed against their collateral  which  in the case of the vehicle financing facilities  consists of substantially all our fleet vehicles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately of our revenue is generated outside the us the result of a uniform change in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies of countries where we do business would not be material 
we do not typically hedge any foreign currency risk since the exposure is immaterial 
interest rate risk our outstanding debt consists of vehicle debt  revolving credit facilities  convertible subordinated debt and other debt which subjects us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at december   we had fixed rate debt totalling  million or of total outstanding debt 
this debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
our floating rate debt was  million or of total outstanding debt at december  the exposure of these obligations to increases in short term interest rates is partially limited by interest rate collar agreements 
the notional amount of these collar agreements is million at december  under these agreements  we will receive payments in the event that the libor based interest rate exceeds and will make payments in the event that the libor based interest rate falls below 
a fluctuation of the interest rate by basis points would change our interest expense by million
