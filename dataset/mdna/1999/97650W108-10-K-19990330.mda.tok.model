the commercial loan component is comprised primarily of commercial real estate loans  lines of credit for working capital purposes  and term loans for the acquisition of equipment 
commercial real estate is predominantly owner occupied and secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property 
equipment loans are generally fully amortized over to months and secured by titles and or ucc filings 
working capital lines are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets  personal guarantees and oftentimes additional collateral 
commercial business lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than traditional consumer bank lending 
the vast majority of commercial loans are made within the banks immediate market areas 
the increase can be attributed to additional banking facilities  an emphasis on business development calling programs and superior servicing of existing commercial loan customers which has increased referrals 
in addition to the home mortgages originated by the banks  the company participates in mortgage warehouse lending by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage brokers to finance residential mortgages originated by such brokers for sale into the secondary market 
the company s loans to the mortgage brokers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the underlying mortgages  the majority of which are funded by the company on a loan by loan basis after they have been pre approved for purchase by third party end lenders who forward payment directly to the company upon their acceptance of final loan documentation 
in addition  the company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage brokers desire to competitively bid a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market 
typically  the company will serve as sole funding source for its mortgage warehouse lending customers under short term revolving credit agreements 
amounts advanced with respect to any particular mortgages are usually required to be repaid within days 
the company has developed strong relationships with a number of mortgage brokers and is seeking to expand its customer base for this specialty business 
the following table classifies the commercial loan portfolio category at december  by date at which the loans mature from one one year to five after or less years five years total in thousands commercial loans and commercial real estate loans     premium finance receivables   of those loans maturing after one year  approximately million have fixed rates 
home equity loans 
the company s home equity loan products are generally structured as lines of credit secured by first or second position mortgage liens on the underlying property with loan to value ratios not exceeding  including prior liens  if any 
the banks home equity loans feature competitive rate structures and fee arrangements 
in addition  the banks periodically offer promotional home equity loan products as part of their marketing strategy often featuring lower introductory rates 
indirect auto loans 
as part of its strategy to pursue specialized earning asset niches to augment loan generation within the banks target markets  the company finances fixed rate automobile loans funded indirectly through unaffiliated automobile dealers 
as of december   indirect auto loans comprised over of the company s consumer loan portfolio 
indirect automobile loans are secured by new and used automobiles and are generated by a network of automobile dealers located in the chicago area with which the company has established relationships 
these credits generally have an average initial balance of approximately  and have an original maturity of to months with the average actual maturity  as a result of prepayments  estimated to be approximately months 
the company does not currently originate any significant level of sub prime loans  which are made to individuals with impaired credit histories at generally higher interest rates  and accordingly  with higher levels of credit risk 
the risk associated with this portfolio is diversified amongst many individual borrowers 
management continually monitors the dealer relationships and the banks are not dependent on any one dealer as a source of such loans 
like other consumer loans  the indirect auto loans are subject to the banks stringent credit standards 
residential real estate mortgages 
the residential real estate category includes one to four family adjustable rate mortgages that have repricing terms generally from one to three years  construction loans to individuals  bridge financing loans for qualifying customers and mortgage loans held for sale into the secondary market 
the adjustable rate mortgages are often non agency conforming  may have terms based on differing indexes  and relate to properties located principally in the chicago metropolitan area or vacation homes owned by local residents 
adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease  but do not eliminate  the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
because periodic and lifetime caps limit the interest rate adjustments  the value of adjustable rate mortgage loans fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
in addition  as interest rates increase  the required payments by the borrower increases  thus increasing the potential for default 
the company does not generally originate loans for its own portfolio with long term fixed rates due to interest rate risk considerations 
however  the banks do accommodate customer requests for fixed rate loans by originating and selling these loans into the secondary market  in connection with which the company receives fee income 
a portion of the loans sold by the banks into the secondary market are to the federal national mortgage association fnma whereby the servicing of those loans is retained 
the amount of loans serviced for fnma as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
all other mortgage loans held for sale are sold into the secondary market without the retention of servicing rights 
premium finance receivables 
the company originates premium finance receivables through fifc  which  in turn  are sold to the banks and retained within their loan portfolios 
prior to october  premium finance receivables were sold and serviced pursuant to a securitization facility 
as of december  and  the company had no premium finance receivables serviced for others by fifc 
all premium finance receivables are subject to the company s stringent credit standards  and substantially all such loans are made to commercial customers 
the company rarely finances consumer insurance premiums 
fifc offers financing of approximately of an insurance premium primarily to commercial purchasers of property and casualty and liability insurance who desire to pay insurance premiums on an installment basis 
the premium finance loan allows the insured to spread the cost of the insurance policy over time 
fifc markets its financial services primarily by establishing and maintaining relationships with medium and large insurance agents and brokers and by offering a high degree of service and innovative products 
senior management is significantly involved in fifc s marketing efforts  currently focused almost exclusively on commercial accounts 
loans are originated by fifc s own sales force by working with insurance agents and brokers throughout the united states 
as of december   fifc had the necessary licensing and other regulatory approvals to do business in all states and the district of columbia 
in financing insurance premiums  the company does not assume the risk of loss normally borne by insurance carriers 
typically  the insured buys an insurance policy from an independent insurance agent or broker who offers financing through fifc 
the insured typically makes a down payment of approximately to of the total premium and signs a premium finance agreement for the balance due  which amount fifc disburses directly to the insurance carrier or its agents to satisfy the unpaid premium amount 
the average initial balance of premium finance loans is approximately  and the average term of the agreements is approximately months 
as the insurer earns the premium ratably over the life of the policy  the unearned portion of the premium secures payment of the balance due to fifc by the insured 
under the terms of the company s standard form of financing contract  the company has the power to cancel the insurance policy if there is a default in the payment on the finance contract and to collect the unearned portion of the premium from the insurance carrier 
in the event of cancellation of a policy  the cash returned in payment of the unearned premium by the insurer should be sufficient to cover the loan balance and generally the interest and other charges due as well 
the major risks inherent in this type of lending are the risk of fraud on the part of an insurance agent whereby the agent fraudulently fails to forward funds to the insurance carrier or to fifc  as the case may be  the risk that the insurance carrier becomes insolvent and is unable to return unearned premiums related to loans in default  for policies that are subject to an audit by the insurance carrier ie workers compensation policies where the insurance carrier can audit the insured actual payroll records  the risk that the initial underwriting of the policy was such that the premium paid by the insured are not sufficient to cover the a entire return premium in the event of default  and that the borrower is unable to ultimately satisfy the debt in the event the returned unearned premium is insufficient to retire the loan 
fifc has established underwriting procedures to reduce the potential of loss associated with the aforementioned risks and has systems in place to continually monitor conditions that would indicate an increase in risk factors and to act on situations where the company s collateral position is in jeopardy 
installment and other 
included in the installment and other loan category is a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals 
the banks have been originating consumer loans in recent years in order to provide a wider range of financial services to their customers 
consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than mortgage loans due to the type and nature of the collateral 
the company had no loans to businesses or governments of foreign countries at any time during the reporting periods
