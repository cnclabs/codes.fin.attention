item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general to date  we have derived most of our revenues from research and development payments and license fees under agreements with collaborative partners 
in  we also derived a significant portion of our revenues from contract manufacturing 
we anticipate that over the next several years we will derive most of our revenues from agreements with collaborative partners  including possible royalty revenues from stryker 
we have never been profitable and expect to incur additional operating losses in results beyond will depend largely on the timing and magnitude of royalty payments from stryker if the op device is approved for commercial sale 
we may incur continued losses in future years 
our research agreements with collaborative partners have typically obligated such collaborative partners to provide for the partial or complete funding of research and development for specified projects and pay royalties to us in exchange for licenses to market the resulting products 
we have been a party to research collaborations with stryker to develop products for orthopaedic reconstruction and dental therapeutics and with biogen to develop products for the treatment of renal disorders 
each of these research collaborations was restructured in under the research portion of our collaboration with stryker  prior to its restructuring in november  we supplied op products to stryker for clinical trials and other uses  provided manufacturing regulatory support and performed research work pursuant to work plans we both established periodically 
in november  we sold our op manufacturing rights and facilities to stryker 
in fiscal  we will focus internal research efforts on developing new tissue regeneration therapies in non bone applications 
in december  we signed a research collaboration and license agreement with biogen the biogen research agreement 
under the biogen research agreement  we performed research work pursuant to work plans we both established periodically 
in  we signed an amendment agreement the biogen amendment agreement with biogen 
under this amendment  we have assumed primary responsibility for the development of products for the treatment of renal disorders 
biogen has provided research funding to us through december although we are seeking and in the future may seek to enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to certain other projects  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such agreements on acceptable terms or that the costs required to complete the projects will not exceed the funding available for such projects from the collaborative partners 
prior to the restructuring of our collaborations with stryker and biogen  our manufacturing contracts provided for technical collaboration and manufacturing for third parties at our manufacturing facility in lebanon  new hampshire and at our research facility in hopkinton  massachusetts 
beginning in january  we were a party to a manufacturing contract with biogen the manufacturing contract to produce several of biogen s protein based therapeutic candidates 
as part of the sale to stryker of our manufacturing facility  stryker assumed our obligations under the manufacturing contract 
we earn and recognize revenue based upon work performed  upon the sale or licensing of product rights  upon shipment of product for use in preclinical and clinical testing or upon attainment of benchmarks specified in collaborative agreements 
our results of operations vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of payments made by collaborative partners and the timing of contract manufacturing activities 
the timing of our contract revenues may not match the timing of our associated product development expenses 
as a result  research and development expenses may exceed contract revenues in any particular period 
furthermore  aggregate research and development contract revenues for any product may not offset all of our development expenses for such product 
results of operations years ended december  and our revenues in the year ended december  were  our revenues in the year ended december  were  research and development contract revenues decreased from  in to  in the decrease in research and development contract revenues from to primarily is a result of a decrease in our research activity under the research collaboration with biogen  partially offset by an increase in research and development contract revenues from the supply of op to stryker 
we anticipate that research and development contract revenues in the year ending december   will be substantially less than the year ended december   because we sold the manufacturing operations to stryker 
we do not anticipate significant research and development contract revenues from stryker in the year ending december  license fees and royalties revenues in the year ended december  include  in revenue from licensing patent rights and know how associated with certain protein technology which is not central to our business 
interest revenues decreased from  in to  in because we had higher average balances in cash and marketable securities in than we had in in december  under the biogen research agreement and a restricted stock purchase agreement  biogen paid to us a  license fee and made an  equity investment in our common stock 
in may  we sold  shares of series a preferred stock 
net proceeds to us  after deducting fees and other expenses of the offering  were approximately  in addition  we received approximately  in the fourth quarter of from the sale of our op manufacturing related assets to stryker 
our total costs and expenses  consisting primarily of research and development expenses  increased from  in the year ended december   to  in the year ended december  research and development expenses decreased from  in to  in our research and development expenses for are slightly less than due to the sale of our op manufacturing rights and facilities to stryker in november and the elimination of manufacturing and facility related expenses 
we anticipate that research and development expenses in will be substantially less than in  due to the sale of the manufacturing facilities to stryker and the elimination of manufacturing and facility related expenses 
during  our research and development expenses included the following activities work in preparation for the filing of a pma application and work in prepa ration for the fda regulatory review of stryker s bone graft substitute product  manufacturing of op and op devices  research into renal disease therapy as part of the biogen collaboration  and research into neurological disease therapies and other indications proprietary to us 
stryker initiated a modular pma filing for the bone graft substitute product following a patient pivotal trial in the treatment of tibial non union fractures which was presented at the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons in march in connection with the fda review of the manufacturing module  we completed revalidating certain manufacturing processes in and stryker has stated that it is working to complete the submission of the modular pma to the fda 
we used the manufacturing facility in lebanon  new hampshire in for the production of op for use by stryker and us 
we reported the costs associated with such production of op as research and development expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in the increase primarily is due to approximately  in increased costs associated with additions to our legal and administrative staff and from increases in external legal and other consulting costs and from costs associated with our administrative office 
in november  we sold our op manufacturing rights and facilities to stryker 
we expect that the sale will provide us with increased royalties on stryker products  if approved for commercial sale  in lieu of the manufacturing revenue anticipated under the prior agreement 
proceeds and expenses associated with this transaction included the following total proceeds  less net book value of manufacturing related assets  employee termination costs  legal  accounting and consulting costs  loss on sale of manufacturing operations  we recorded a charge of  in the quarter ended december   in connection with this transaction 
interest expense increased from  in to  in the increase in interest expense is due to an increase in our obligations under an equipment lease agreement 
as part of the sale to stryker of the manufacturing related assets  stryker assumed  of our obligations under equipment lease agreements and  of our obligations under a facility capital lease 
as a result of the foregoing  we incurred a net loss of  in the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  in the year ended december  accretion on series a preferred stock for the year ended december   includes  calculated at the rate of per annum of the stated value of the outstanding series a preferred stock from may  and  of accretion of issuance costs related to the sale of series a preferred stock 
we are accreting the series a preferred stock up to its conversion value 
in computing the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december   accretion of the series a preferred stock mentioned above is included 
years ended december  and our revenues in the year ended december  were  our revenues in the year ended december  were  research and development contract revenues increased from  in to  in the increase in research and development contract revenues from to primarily is a result of research activity under the research collaboration with biogen including revenue from the supply of op to biogen pursuant to the biogen research agreement 
manufacturing contract revenues in reflect manufacturing for biogen  under the manufacturing contract  conducted at the company s manufacturing facility in lebanon  new hampshire 
manufacturing contract revenues in reflect manufacturing for biogen  under a service agreement separate from the biogen research agreement and manufacturing contract  conducted at the company s research facility in hopkinton  massachusetts 
license fees and royalties revenues in include a  license fee from biogen as part of our research collaboration to develop products for the treatment of renal disorders   from stryker for our licensing to stryker of certain patent rights and know how in the dental field  and  for licensing patent rights and know how associated with certain protein technology which is not central to our business 
interest revenues increased from  in to  in interest revenue increased because we had higher average balances in cash and marketable securities in than we had in in december  under the biogen research agreement and a restricted stock purchase agreement  biogen paid to us a  license fee and made an  equity investment in our common stock 
our total costs and expenses  consisting primarily of research and development expenses  increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  research and development expenses increased from  in to  in from to  we expanded our research and development activities to include the following work in preparation for the filing of a pma application and work in preparation for the fda regulatory review of stryker s bone graft substitute product  research into renal disease therapy as part of the biogen collaboration  and research into neurological disease therapies and other indications proprietary to us 
in addition  in we used the manufacturing facility in lebanon  new hampshire for the production of op for use by stryker  biogen and us 
we reported the costs associated with such production of op as research and development expenses 
cost of manufacturing contracts consists of the costs associated with our manufacturing activities for biogen  discussed under manufacturing contract revenues above 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in the increase primarily is due to increased costs associated with additions to our legal  corporate communications  business development and other administrative staff 
as a result of the foregoing  we incurred a net loss of  in the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  and  remaining on an equipment lease line  as discussed further below 
we have financed our operations primarily through placements of equity securities  revenues received under agreements with collaborative partners  and more recently  manufacturing contracts and the sale of our op manufacturing rights and facilities to stryker 
we reduced our investment in property  plant and equipment to  at december  from  at december   as a result of the sale of our manufacturing facilities to stryker 
we currently plan to spend approximately  in the year ending december  in leasehold improvements and equipment purchases to upgrade our research and development capabilities 
in october  we entered into a master lease agreement to provide for the lease financing of up to  of laboratory and office equipment 
at december    is available under this lease commitment 
on may   we completed a private placement with three institutional investors for the sale of  shares of series a preferred stock  with a stated value of  per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately  after expenses 
the series a preferred stock is convertible into the number of shares of our common stock  equal to the stated value plus accretion of per annum divided by the then applicable conversion price 
the conversion price is equal to the average of the five lowest closing bid prices of the common stock during the twenty consecutive trading days immediately preceding the conversion date 
from may through may  the conversion price may not exceed 
from june through january  the conversion price may not exceed 
there are certain limits on the number of shares of series a preferred stock that investors may convert per month from may through january and no investor will be permitted at any time to convert an amount of shares of series a preferred stock which would result in such investor owning more than of the then outstanding common stock 
the maximum total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock is  the series a preferred stock is subject to redemption for cash at varying percentages of the stated value plus accretion of per annum 
we may redeem all or a portion of the series a preferred stock under certain conditions summarized below at a redemption percentage of of the stated value  or at a redemption percentage of of the stated value if the market price of the common stock falls below certain thresholds 
we may also redeem the series a preferred stock at redemption percentages ranging from to in connection with certain acquisitions of creative biomolecules  inc we may be required to redeem all or a portion of the series a preferred stock under certain conditions listed below at a redemption percentage of of the stated value upon the occurrence of certain events described in the certificate of designations for the series a preferred stock  or at a redemption percentage of of the stated value if the market price of the common stock falls below certain thresholds 
if we are required to redeem all or a portion of the outstanding series a preferred stock  such redemption may significantly reduce our available cash 
any shares of series a preferred stock not converted into common stock by may will convert into common stock at the then effective conversion price 
during the six month period ended december   holders of series a preferred stock elected to convert  shares of series a preferred stock into  shares of common stock 
we are investigating the possibility of restructuring the series a preferred stock 
such a restructuring may require us to redeem some portion of the series a preferred stock and thus may reduce our available cash 
in november  we sold our op manufacturing rights and facilities to stryker for total proceeds of  we expect that the sale will provide us with increased royalties on stryker products  if approved for commercial sale  in lieu of the manufacturing revenues anticipated under the prior agreement 
we will pay approximately  of accrued costs  principally representing future cash outlays for employee termination costs  in the year ending december  in prior years  we received significant revenue from stryker for research support and the supply of op as a result of the sale of our op manufacturing rights and facilities to stryker  we anticipate significantly reduced research funding in the year ending december  in december  we signed the biogen amendment agreement 
under the amended agreement  biogen paid  to fund our research in for development of op as a therapy for chronic renal failure 
biogen retains an option through december to resume responsibility for development of op as a therapy for chronic renal failure 
if biogen chooses not to exercise its option  biogen has no further obligation to provide funds to us 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources should enable us to maintain our current and planned operations through  assuming we are not required to redeem all or a portion of the outstanding series a preferred stock 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development and other costs  including costs related to preclinical studies and clinical trials 
our ability to continue funding planned operations is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from royalties on stryker products  if approved for commercial sale  from collaborative arrangements and from additional funds through equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
we are seeking additional collaborative arrangements and also expect to raise funds through one or more financing transactions  if conditions permit 
over the longer term  because of our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to raise funds when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
if stryker products are not approved for commercial sale and we do not receive royalties from stryker and substantial additional funding is not available  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb released statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 which the company will be required to adopt effective january  sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and accounting for derivative instruments  and conforms the requirements for treatment of hedging activities across the different types of exposures hedged 
the company has not yet completed its evaluation of sfas no 
 and is therefore unable to disclose the impact adoption will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  by the end of  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
if they are not  it may result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations 
we have developed a plan to address the year issues 
in  we conducted a review of our computer systems to identify those areas that could be affected by the year issue 
we also completed implementation of a new financial accounting system that the vendor designed to properly process transactions which could be impacted by the year problem 
we presently believe that  with routine upgrades to existing hardware and software systems  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems 
we also are communicating with our significant suppliers and customers to determine the progress such suppliers and customers are making in remediating their own year issues 
we are requiring that such significant suppliers and customers certify that those products and services that are used in our operations are year compliant 
if such upgrades are not made  are not completed timely  or if any of our suppliers or customers do not successfully deal with the year issue  the year issue could have a material impact on our operations 
we could experience delays in receiving or sending our products that would increase our costs and that could cause us to lose business and even customers and could subject us to claims for damages 
problems with the year issue could also result in delays in invoicing our customers or in us receiving payments from them 
in addition  our research and development efforts  which rely on the storage and retrieval of electronic information  could be interrupted resulting in the loss of current collaborations  and the impairment of our ability to enter into new collaborations 
the severity of these possible problems would depend on the nature of the problem and how quickly it could be corrected or an alternative implemented  which is unknown at this time 
in the extreme  such problems could bring our operations to a standstill 
while management has not yet specifically determined the costs associated with our year readiness efforts  monitoring and managing the year issue will result in additional direct and indirect costs to us 
direct costs include potential charges by third party software vendors for product enhancements  costs involved in testing software products for year compliance and any resulting costs for developing and implementing contingency plans for critical software products which are not enhanced 
indirect costs will principally consist of the time devoted by existing employees in monitoring software vendor progress  testing enhanced software products and implementing any necessary contingency plans 
such costs have not been material to date 
both direct and indirect costs of addressing the year issue will be charged to earnings as incurred 
to date  our year remediation costs have not been material to our financial position or results of operations and we believe that future costs to complete such remediation will not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
we expect to complete the remediation of our year issues by the end of the second fiscal quarter of we have not yet developed a contingency plan to address any unresolved year issues but presently intend to develop a contingency plan before the end of the second fiscal quarter of some risks of the year issue  however  are beyond our control and the control of our suppliers and customers 
for example  no preparations or contingency plan will protect us from a downturn in economic activity caused by the possible ripple effect throughout the entire economy caused by the year issue

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term marketable securities  generally corporate bonds and notes with minimum rating of a and united states government and agency instruments 
the maturities of these instruments range from one to twenty nine months  with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
at december   the fair market value of these securities amounted to  with unrealized gains of  included as a component of stockholders equity 
if interest rates were to increase rapidly by  an event we consider unlikely  the carrying value of the securities portfolio could decline by approximately  however  because of the quality of the investment portfolio and the short term nature of the marketable securities  we do not believe that the principal amount of the securities would be impaired and  therefore  no loss would be ultimately recognized in the statement of operations
