item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table reflects items in the company s statement of earnings as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated fiscal year weeks weeks weeks sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization interest expense earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net earnings the following table reflects the sources of the increases in company sales for the periods indicated fiscal year weeks weeks weeks store sales s    catalog sales s    sales s    total sales growth growth in comparable store sales week basis growth in catalog sales store locations existing stores beginning of period stores closed new stores opened during period total stores at end of period total company sales increased in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the company believes that such increases were primarily due to the continued store expansion program 
the company opened four stores during fiscal and closed one store 
stores were opened in oak brook and skokie  illinois  san antonio  texas alamo quarry market and salt lake city  utah 
a store closed in san antonio  texas broadway and austin highway 
total company sales increased in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the company believes that such increases were primarily due to the continued store expansion program 
the company opened five stores and one outlet during fiscal and closed one store 
stores were opened in cordova  tennessee memphis metro  wichita  kansas  columbus  ohio  richmond  virginia  birmingham  alabama  and an outlet in sealy  texas 
a store closed in kensington  md washington  dc metro 
the company opened six stores and one outlet during fiscal stores were opened in greenville  south carolina  leawood  kansas  raleigh  north carolina  mclean  virginia  littleton  colorado denver metro  houston  texas known as harold powell  and an outlet in norman  oklahoma 
comparable store sales declined during fiscal  compared to a decline of in fiscal the company believes that the declines experienced in comparable store sales during fiscal and fiscal were primarily attributable to the opening of second stores in several key markets  including birmingham  alabama  norman  oklahoma  memphis  tennessee  dallas  houston  and san antonio  texas  and washington  dc  as well as lower than anticipated sales of fashion apparel merchandise in fiscal catalog sales declined during fiscal compared to an increase of during fiscal the decline during fiscal was due to a reduction in the total number of catalogs circulated 
since the test market of harold s first catalog  the company has expanded its regular catalog to include six seasonal issues each year 
for fiscal  the company s catalog averaged pages per issue with an aggregate mailing including abridged issues of approximately million catalogs 
the increase during fiscal was due to expanded catalog circulation 
the company s gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin can be primarily attributed to improved inventory planning and customer acceptance of product offerings  resulting in lower inventory levels and reduced markdowns 
the company s gross margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the company experienced higher markdowns due to excess inventory levels  resulting from lower than anticipated sales of fashion apparel merchandise 
in addition  higher occupancy costs that did not leverage due to lower sales negatively impacted the gross margin 
any increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales will be the result of increasing sales while controlling selling  general and administrative expenses and improvement in gross margin from sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by of sales in fiscal compared to an increase of of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal was primarily due to reduced advertising and catalog production costs  offset by increased payroll related expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal was primarily due to increased catalog fulfillment cost and increases in sales salaries in order to maintain exceptional customer service expectations 
in fiscal  the company initiated a reduction in the total number of catalogs circulated to reduce costs  while attempting to minimize the reduction in sales 
the result was a  or  decline in production costs and an  or  decline in catalog sales 
in fiscal  the company increased circulation in attempts to increase the rate of sales growth in the catalog division  resulting in an increase in catalog expenses of  or 
non catalog advertising expenditures decreased in fiscal compared to an increase of in fiscal such expenses decreased in fiscal as a result of improved sales and lower inventory levels and increased in fiscal as a result of promotional activity to clear excess inventory levels 
during fiscal  the total interest costs including capitalized interest decreased  compared to fiscal due to lower outstanding debt balances 
the average balance on total outstanding debt was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in average debt balances resulted principally from lower inventory levels 
as the company s growth continues  cash flow may require additional borrowed funds  which may cause an increase in interest expense 
during fiscal  interest costs including capitalized interest increased  as compared to fiscal due to higher inventory balances 
the company s income tax rate was in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal capital expenditures  capital resources and liquidity cash flows from operating activities 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was  as compared to  net cash used in operating activities for fiscal the increase in cash flows can be partially attributed to i net earnings of  for fiscal  compared to net earnings of  for fiscal  an increase in net earnings of  ii the timing of accrued expenses as reflected in an increase in accrued expenses of  in fiscal  compared to a decrease in accrued expenses of  in fiscal  iii the timing of accounts payable as reflected by a decline in accounts payable of  in fiscal  compared to a decrease in accounts payable of  in fiscal the company s merchandise inventories decreased  in fiscal compared to an increase of  for fiscal as a result of the company s improved inventory planning and customer acceptance of product offerings 
management expects the dollar amount of the company s merchandise inventories to increase with the expansion of its product development programs  private label merchandise and chain of retail stores  with related increases in trade accounts receivable and accounts payable 
period to period differences in timing of inventory purchases and deliveries will affect comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was  as compared to  for fiscal capital expenditures totaled  compared to  for fiscal capital expenditures during such periods were invested principally in new stores  and remodeling and equipment expenditures in existing operations 
on november   the company made a term loan to cmt enterprises  inc cmt in the principal amount of  to be used by cmt to refinance its existing revolving line of credit and for working capital purposes 
at march   the outstanding balance of the loan was  cmt is a major independent contractor whose assistance is instrumental in the company s design and manufacturing process 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities 
during fiscal  the company made periodic borrowings under its revolving credit facility to finance its inventory purchases  product development and private label programs  store expansion  remodeling and equipment purchases for the fiscal year see liquidity 
the company has available a line of credit with its bank 
this line had average balances of  and  for the fiscal years and  respectively 
during  this line of credit had a high balance of  and a balance of  as of january  the balance at march  was  liquidity 
the company considers the following as measures of liquidity and capital resources as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
fiscal year working capital    current ratio ratio of working capital 


to total assets ratio of long term debt including current 


maturities to stockholders equity the company s primary needs for liquidity are to finance its inventories and revolving charge accounts and to invest in new stores  remodeling  fixtures and equipment 
cash flow from operations and proceeds from credit facilities represent the company s sources of liquidity 
management anticipates these sources of liquidity to be sufficient in the foreseeable future 
the company s capital expenditures budget for fiscal is approximately  seasonality the company s business is subject to seasonal influences  with the major portion of sales realized during the fall season third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  which includes the back to school and holiday selling seasons 
in light of this pattern  selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher as a percentage of sales during the spring seasons first and second quarters of each fiscal year 
inflation inflation affects the costs incurred by the company in its purchase of merchandise and in certain components of its selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company attempts to offset the effects of inflation through price increases and control of expenses  although the company s ability to increase prices is limited by competitive factors in its markets 
inflation has had no meaningful effect on sales or net earnings of the company 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes standards for accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
management is currently evaluating the impact of this standard and believes its adoption will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sop is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
year many computer systems use only two digits to identify a year for example  is used for the year 
as a result  these systems may be unable to process accurately dates later than december   since they may recognize as the year  instead of the year 
this anomaly is often referred to as the year compliance issue 
since  the company has been executing a plan to remediate or replace affected systems on a timely basis 
equipment and other non information technology systems that use microchips or other embedded technology  such as certain conveyor systems at the company s distribution center  are also covered by the company s year compliance project 
the company s year compliance project includes four phases evaluation of the company s owned or leased systems and equipment to identify potential year compliance issues  remediation or replacement of company systems and equipment determined to be non compliant and testing of remediated systems before returning them to production  inquiry regarding year readiness of material business partners and other third parties on whom the company s business is dependent  and development of contingency plans  where feasible  to address potential third party non compliance or failure of material company systems 
the initial phase of the company s year compliance project was the evaluation of all software  hardware and equipment owned  leased or licensed by the company  and identification of those systems and equipment requiring year remediation 
this analysis was completed during fiscal all computer hardware in the company s corporate office and distribution center that was not year compliant has been remediated or replaced  and all computer hardware in the company s retail stores that was not year compliant will be remediated or replaced by the end of the second quarter of fiscal of those software systems that were found not to be year compliant  approximately of all material systems have been remediated or replaced by year compliant software 
the company anticipates that all remaining material systems  including certain operating systems used in the company s distribution center  will be remediated or replaced by the end of the second quarter of fiscal over the past few years  the company s strategic plan has included significant investment in and modernization of many of the company s computer systems 
as a result  much of the costs and timing for replacement of certain of the company s systems that were not year compliant were already anticipated as part of the company s planned information systems spending and did not need to be accelerated as a result of the company s year project 
the total cost to the company specifically associated with addressing the year issue with respect to its systems and equipment has not been  and is not anticipated to be  material to the company s financial position or results of operations in any given year 
the company estimates that the total additional cost of managing its year project  remediating existing systems and replacing non compliant systems  is approximately million  of which approximately million was expended in fiscal and the balance anticipated to be expended in fiscal although the company believes its year compliance efforts with respect to its systems will be successful  any failure or delay could result in actual costs and timing differing materially from that presently contemplated  and in a disruption of business 
the company is developing a contingency plan to permit its primary operations to continue if the company s modifications and conversions of its systems are not successfully completed on a timely basis  but the foregoing cost estimates do not take into account any expenditures arising out of a response to any such contingencies that materialize 
the company s cost estimates also do not include time or costs that may be incurred as a result of third parties failure to become year compliant on a timely basis 
the company is communicating with its business partners  including key manufacturers  vendors  banks and other third parties with whom it does business  to obtain information regarding their state of readiness with respect to the year issue 
failure of third parties to remediate year issues affecting their respective businesses on a timely basis  or to implement contingency plans sufficient to permit uninterrupted continuation of their businesses in the event of a failure of their systems  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
assessment of third party year readiness is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal the company will not be able to determine its most reasonably likely worst case scenarios until assessment of third parties year compliance is completed 
the company s year compliance project also includes development of a contingency plan designed to support critical business operations in the event of the occurrence of systems failures or the occurrence of reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
the company anticipates that contingency plans will be substantially developed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the company may not be able to compensate adequately for business interruption caused by certain third parties 
potential risks include suspension or significant curtailment of service or significant delays by banks  utilities or common carriers  or at us ports of entry 
the company s business also could be materially adversely affected by the failure of governmental agencies to address year issues affecting the company s operations 
for example  a significant amount of the company s merchandise is manufactured outside the united states  and the company is dependent upon the issuance by foreign governmental agencies of export visas for  and upon the us customs service to process and permit entry into the united states of  such merchandise 
if failures in government systems result in the suspension or delay of these agencies services  the company could experience significant interruption or delays in its inventory flow 
the costs and timing for management s completion of year compliance modification and testing processes are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  the success of third parties year compliance efforts and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these assumptions will be realized or that actual results will not materially vary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for the company refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and various foreign currencies 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
interest rate at january   the company had long term debt outstanding of approximately million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
the remaining million bears interest at variable rates which averaged approximately at january  a increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debt outstanding at january  would approximate basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above 
foreign currency substantially all of the company s purchases are priced in us dollars 
however  some european purchases are denominated in local currency and  therefore  are subject to the fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
from time to time the company utilizes forward exchange contracts to secure firm pricing related to purchase commitments to be denominated in foreign currencies 
the contracts are of varying short term durations and amounts include a window delivery feature  which provides the company with an option to enter into a swap agreement in the event that all of the currency is not utilized at the end of the contract s delivery term 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the principal currency hedged is the italian lira 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
the company had no foreign exchange instruments outstanding at january   therefore  a sensitivity analysis would result in no impact to earnings 
anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies would be excluded from the sensitivity analysis 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company during fiscal years  and
