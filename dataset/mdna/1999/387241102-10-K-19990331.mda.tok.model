year the company is preparing for the impact of the year on its business  as well as on the businesses of its customers  suppliers and business partners 
the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the computer programs and or hardware used by the company that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the year issue could result in system failure or miscalculations in the operations at the company s broadcast and corporate locations 
the disruption of operations could include  among other things  a temporary inability to originate and transmit broadcast programming and commercials  process financial information or engage in other normal business activity 
the company may also be exposed to risks from third parties with which the company interacts who fail to adequately address their own year issues 
state of readiness the company has developed a multiple phase approach to identify and evaluate its state of year readiness for both its information technology it and non it systems 
the first phase was to develop a company wide  uniform strategy for addressing the year issue and to assess the company s current state of year readiness 
this included an internal review at each location of all it and non it systems for potential year issues 
the company has completed this review and has identified the systems that need to be updated or replaced to ensure year compliance 
based on these system evaluations  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software and certain hardware so that its systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the primary systems that are being addressed are the master control automation systems  ibm as  the computer used to process sales  traffic  accounts receivable  accounts payable and the general ledger  and systems with embedded chips  including telephone and security systems 
the next phase was to develop uniform test plans and test methodologies 
the company has begun to test and update its systems  and expects that all testing will be completed by august the company has retained an independent consulting firm with experience in the broadcasting industry to review the company s year procedures and guidelines 
the company expects that the independent consultant will complete its review by the end of april although the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of its year program  it believes that it has an effective program in place to resolve its critical internal year issues in a timely manner 
costs to address the company s year issues the company will incur capital expenditures and incremental expenses to bring current systems into compliance 
total incremental expenses have not had a material impact on the company s financial condition to date and are not at present  based on known facts  expected to have a material impact on the company s financial condition

there are no it projects that have been delayed due to year efforts 
risks of the company s year issues while the company believes its efforts will provide reasonable assurance that material disruption will not occur due to internal year failures  the possibility of disruption  especially from third parities  still exists 
the company s operations are vulnerable to system experienced by the network program providers  certain satellite services  software and hardware providers  local and long distance telephone providers  power companies  financial services providers and others upon whom the company relies for supporting services 
in an effort to determine its vulnerabilities to third party year failures  the company currently is requesting year compliance data from all of its suppliers and vendors 
the company will use this information in an attempt to identify whether any of these parties has a year issue that may materially impact the company s operations  liquidity  capital resources or certain other functions 
the company does not  however  control the systems of other companies  and cannot assure that these systems will be timely converted and  if not converted  would not have an adverse effect on the company s business operations 
in the event that the company and or its significant vendors or suppliers do not complete their year compliance efforts  the company could experience disruptions in its operations  including a temporary inability to engage in normal broadcast or business activities 
disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues also could affect the company 
contingency plans the company is developing a contingency plan to address system failures that are critical to conduct its business 
these plans include  but are not limited to  increases in overtime salaries and or increases in personnel to operate systems that would ordinarily be operated by a computer 
the company expects to have its contingency plan completed by september year forward looking statements the foregoing year discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of such statements including without limitation  anticipated costs and the dates by which the company expects to complete certain actions  are based on management s best current estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions about future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  representations received from third parties and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the ability to identify and remediate all relevant it and non it systems  results of year testing  adequate resolution of year issues by businesses and other third parties who are service providers  suppliers or customers of the company  unanticipated system costs  the adequacy of and ability to develop and implement contingency plans and similar uncertainties
