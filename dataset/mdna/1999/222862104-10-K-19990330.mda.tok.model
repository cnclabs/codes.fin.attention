general effective april   the company completed its acquisition of certain assets of phc from principal life for a total purchase price of million including transaction costs of approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  the operating results of the phc plans have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
coincident with the closing of the transaction  the company entered into a marketing services agreement and a management services agreement with principal life 
both agreements extend through december  pursuant to these agreements  the company recognized approximately million for the year ended december   and expects to receive payments of approximately million in as a result of the transaction  the company assumed an agreement with principal life  whereby principal life pays a fee for access to the company s ppo network based on a fixed rate per each employee entitled to access the ppo network and a percentage of savings realized by principal life 
under this agreement  the company recognized approximately million for the year ended december  the maximum amount that can be paid under the percentage of savings component of the agreement is million for effective november   the company sold its subsidiary  principal health care of illinois  inc for million in cash 
this plan had approximately  risk members and approximately  non risk members as of november  and reported million in revenues since april   the date of acquisition 
effective december   the company sold its subsidiary  principal health care of florida  inc for million in cash 
the florida health plan had approximately  risk members and approximately  non risk members at december  and reported million in revenues since april   the date of acquisition 
the proceeds from both sales were used to retire the credit facility  to assist in improving the capital position of the company s regulated subsidiaries  and for other general corporate purposes 
in march  the company entered into a global capitation agreement with allegheny health  education and research foundation aherf covering approximately  members in the western pennsylvania market 
under the agreement aherf received to of the premium to cover all of the medical expenses of the capitated members 
in july  aherf filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter as a result  the company  which is ultimately responsible for the medical costs of the capitated members  recorded a charge of million to establish a reserve for the medical costs incurred by members covered by the aherf agreement at the time of the bankruptcy filing and other potential bankruptcy charges 
under applicable bankruptcy laws  aherf could reject and refuse to perform under the global capitation agreement 
generally  under chapter  a debtor company such as aherf may affirm or reject its contractual obligations prior to confirmation of a plan of reorganization  and if a contract is rejected  the contractual damages become an unsecured claim in the chapter proceeding 
although aherf has not formally rejected the risk sharing agreement as of the date of this filing  the parties are negotiating a resolution of the arrangement and  currently  neither aherf nor the company is operating under the existing agreement 
the company has filed a lawsuit against certain hospital subsidiaries of aherf that were not included in the bankruptcy filing 
the lawsuit is seeking a court order declaring that the company is not liable for the payment of million of medical services provided by the hospitals to the company s members prior to the date of aherf s bankruptcy filing and compelling the hospitals to fulfill their contractual obligations to continue to provide health care services to the membership in western pennsylvania 
the lawsuit also includes a claim for damages to recover the losses incurred by the company as a consequence of aherf s default of its obligations under the risk sharing agreement 
in response to the lawsuit  the hospitals have filed a counterclaim alleging that hapa  notwithstanding aherf s assumption of the payment obligation  is liable to the hospitals for the payment of medical services provided prior to aherf s bankruptcy 
the company intends to vigorously defend against the counterclaim 
the company believes that the reserve established is adequate to provide for the claims incurred with respect to the aherf arrangement and other related aherf bankruptcy uncertainties 
for the year ended december   million has been paid for medical claims related to this reserve 
during the three years ended december   the company experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due primarily to membership growth  much of which was attributable to the acquisition of the phc plans effective april  additional membership growth was achieved through marketing efforts  acquisitions  geographic expansion and increased product offerings 
the company s managed care premium revenues during the three years ended december  were comprised primarily of premiums from its commercial hmo products and flexible provider products  including ppo and pos products for which the company assumes full underwriting risk 
premiums for such ppo pos products are typically lower than hmo premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and copayments that are required from the ppo pos members 
prior to the sale of the company s medical offices discussed below  additional revenue was received from other medical services provided on a fee for service basis in those medical offices 
premium rates for commercial hmo products are reviewed by various state agencies based on rate filings 
while the company has not had such filings modified  no assurance can be given that approvals for rate submissions will continue 
premium rates for the medicaid and medicare risk products are established by governmental regulatory agencies and may be reduced by regulatory action 
the company s management services revenues result from operations in which the company s health plans provide administrative and other services to self insured employers and to employer group beneficiaries that have elected hmo coverage under products jointly marketed with principal life 
the company receives an administrative fee for these services  but does not assume underwriting risk 
in addition  the company also offers a ppo product to other third party payors  under which it provides rental of and access to the company s ppo network  claims repricing and utilization review  and does not assume underwriting risk 
the company s operating expenses are primarily medical costs including medical claims under contracted relationships with a wide variety of providers  capitation payments and  prior to their sale in  expenses relating to the operation of the company s health centers 
medical claims expense also includes an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
the company believes that the estimates for ibnr liabilities relating to its businesses are adequate in order to satisfy its ultimate claims liability with respect thereto 
in determining the company s medical claims reserves  the company employs plan by plan standard actuarial reserving methods specific to the plan s membership  product characteristics  geographic territories and provider network that consider utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient  outpatient  pharmacy  and other medical costs as well as claim payment backlogs and the changing timing of provider reimbursement practices 
calculated reserves are reviewed by underwriting  finance and accounting  and other appropriate plan and corporate personnel and judgments are then made as to the necessity for reserves in addition to the above calculated amounts 
changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience  changes in the delivery system  changes in pricing due to ancillary capitation and fluctuations in the claims backlog could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
the company periodically monitors and reviews ibnr  and as actual settlements are made or reserves adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
comparison of to managed care premiums increased in million  or  compared to the phc plans accounted for approximately million  or  of the increase 
exclusive of the phc plans  the medicare risk membership increased by  members  or 
medicare risk membership has a significantly higher per member per month premium approximately three times when compared to commercial risk membership and represented an increase in premiums  exclusive of the phc plans  of million from million in to million in the increase in medicare risk membership was offset by a  decrease in medicaid risk membership primarily resulting from the company s decision to exit the medicaid market in pennsylvania in the first quarter of in addition  revenues per member per month  exclusive of the phc plans  increased by for hmo members  for ppo pos members and for medicaid members in over excluding medicaid membership  risk membership grew by  or 
the company continues to implement rate increases that averaged approximately in the fourth quarter of and expects similar rate increases to be implemented in the company has exited the medicare program in several counties representing approximately  members as of december  approximately  of those members were in the illinois and florida health plans that were sold effective november  and december   respectively 
the remaining markets are being exited because the reimbursement rates are not adequate and or the company was not successful in negotiating adequate reimbursement rates 
management services revenue increased million for the year ended december   or  from the prior year 
management services and marketing services agreements that were entered into coincident with the acquisition of the phc plans accounted for approximately million  or  of the increase 
approximately million  or  of the increase is primarily attributable to the phc administrative services only aso operations and ppo access fees 
exclusive of the phc plans and the related agreements with principal life  management services revenue increased approximately million  or  attributable to transition services related to global capitation agreements and rate increases to aso customers

the company s medical loss ratio increased slightly to from in the previous year  primarily as a result of increases in medicare membership 
the company continues to focus intensely on ways to control its medical costs  including implementation of best practices to reduce inpatient days and improvement of the overall quality and level of care 
the company is also continuously monitoring and renegotiating with its provider networks to improve reimbursement rates and improve access to the network for its members 
as previously discussed  in july  aherf  the global capitation provider organization in western pennsylvania  filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter as a result  the extent to which aherf will perform its obligations under the global capitation agreement is uncertain 
in addition to the charge to provide for the estimated claims that were incurred but not reported ibnr on behalf of the globally capitated members at the date of the bankruptcy filing  the medical loss ratio for the globally capitated members was negatively impacted compared to the percentage of premium paid to aherf under the global capitation agreement 
in addition  the company increased administrative staff for patient utilization and medical management in western pennsylvania 
medical claim liability accruals are periodically monitored and reviewed with differences for actual settlements from reserves reflected in current operations 
in addition to the procedures for determining reserves as discussed above  the company reviews the actual payout of claims relating to prior period accruals  which may take up to six months to fully develop 
medical costs are affected by a variety of factors  including the severity and frequency of claims  that are difficult to predict and may not be entirely within the company s control 
the company continually refines its reserving practices to incorporate new cost events and trends 
selling  general and administrative sga expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the phc plans accounted for approximately million  or  of the increase 
the remainder of the increase in sga is primarily attributable to the increased costs relating to administrative processes  particularly in claims processing  associated with the growth of the medicare product in certain markets 
sga expense as a percent of revenue remained at for the year ended in an effort to control costs and improve customer service  the company is in the process of migrating certain of its operating activities eg  customer service  claims processing  billing and enrollment to regional service centers 
it is anticipated that the service centers will be fully operational in the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to depreciation expense from the phc plans accounted for approximately million  or  of the increase

other income  net of interest expense  related to the phc plans accounted for approximately million  or  of the increase 
exclusive of the phc plans  other income  net of interest expense  decreased by million 
this reduction was primarily attributable to a million pre tax gain related to the sale of medical offices that was recognized in the prior year  offset by increased investment income resulting from the increase in invested assets subsequent to the acquisition of the phc plans 
the company s net loss was million for the year ended december  net loss per common and common equivalent share was for the year ended december  compared to earnings per common and common equivalent share of for the corresponding period in excluding the million of charges associated with the aherf bankruptcy and the relocation of the corporate headquarters and other merger related costs  the company reported earnings per common and common equivalent share of in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding were approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the weighted average number of shares outstanding in was primarily attributable to the shares issued in april related to the acquisition of the phc plans 
effective in the fourth quarter of  the company adopted sfas  earnings per share 
accordingly  prior periods have been restated 
comparison of to managed care premiums increased million  or to  million for compared to the revenue increase for the year was enhanced by the growth in medicare risk membership of  which has a significantly higher per member per month premium when compared to the commercial and medicaid products and represented an increase in premiums of million from million in to million in and increases in premium rates as members renew 
premium yields on hmo  ppo pos and medicaid members increased by  and in compared to  respectively 
the revenue increase is also a result of risk membership growth of  or  from the prior year

see risk factors risks of agreements with providers for a discussion of the credit and operational risk associated with global capitation agreements with single provider organizations 
medical loss ratios increased in the central pennsylvania region due to increases in inpatient alternatives such as outpatient surgery  referrals to specialists  pharmacy and increased health benefit expense associated with the medicaid membership 
significant medical cost increases in the medicare risk product in st 
louis  missouri were a result of increased medicare risk membership and utilization of inpatient services 
the company determined  at the end of  that its florida operations were not sufficiently profitable to justify a continued presence in the florida market and  as a result  the company discontinued operations in the florida hmo market on june  the company established a reserve of million at december  to reflect the anticipated costs of exiting this market and the reserve is believed to be sufficient to cover the anticipated costs 
during the third quarter of  the company began to exit its medicaid operations in pennsylvania 
the company fully exited the western and central pennsylvania medicaid markets effective december  and march   respectively

selling  general and administrative sga expense increased million  or  from the prior year  but as a percent of revenue decreased from in to in sga in included termination costs of million and charge off of capitalized new market development costs of million 
the increase in sga in is primarily attributable to the increase in full risk membership  additional personnel costs relating to the re engineering of administrative processes in claims processing  information systems and customer services and costs associated with the growth of the company s medicare risk product 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  from this decrease is primarily the result of the medical office sales in  write off of million of goodwill related to the acquisition of partners health plan of pennsylvania  inc due to application of sfas and apb in and charge offs of million of property and equipment due to application of the impairment criteria of sfas in income from operations was million  a million improvement over the prior year

liquidity and capital resources the company s total cash and investments  excluding deposits of million restricted under state regulations  increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the phc plans that increased cash and investments by million as of april   the date of acquisition  as well as the net proceeds from the sale of the florida and illinois health plans that were effective december  and november   respectively 
the company s investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide short term liquidity and minimize the risk to principal 
the company believes that since its long term investments are available for sale  the amount of such investments should be added to current assets when assessing the company s working capital and liquidity  on such basis  current assets plus long term investments available for sale less short term liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  the company s hmos and insurance company subsidiary are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances  thereby limiting the dividends the company may receive from its hmos and insurance company subsidiary 
after giving effect to these statutory reserve requirements  the company s regulated subsidiaries had surplus in excess of statutory requirements of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company will be required to provide additional capital to its regulated subsidiaries to provide for additional medical claim liabilities related to the aherf bankruptcy 
excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation  the company had cash and investments of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively  which are available to pay intercompany balances to regulated subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes 
the company also has entered into agreements with certain of its regulated subsidiaries to provide additional capital if necessary to prevent the subsidiary s insolvency 
on december   the company entered into a credit agreement with a group of banks the credit facility  which replaced a prior credit agreement 
using a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of its florida health plan  the company retired the credit facility and the million balance then outstanding effective december  on december   the effective interest rate on the indebtedness retired was

the coventry notes are convertible into million shares of the company s common stock and are exchangeable at the company s or warburg s option for shares of convertible preferred stock 
interest is payable in additional coventry notes and  as a result  the accrued interest at december  has been added to the outstanding indebtedness  resulting in million of coventry notes outstanding at such date 
projected capital investments in of approximately million consist primarily of computer hardware  software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communications systems 
the company believes that cash flows generated from operations  cash on hand and investments  and excess funds in certain of its regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations through december  legislation and regulation numerous proposals have been introduced in the united states congress and various state legislatures relating to health care reform 
some proposals  if enacted  could among other things  restrict the company s ability to raise prices and to contract independently with employers and providers 
certain reform proposals favor the growth of managed health care  while others would adversely affect managed care 
although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level cannot be accurately predicted at this time  management of the company believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation would not have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations in the short term

contracting physicians are required to maintain professional liability insurance 
in addition  the company carries stop loss reinsurance to reimburse it for costs resulting from catastrophic injuries or illnesses to its members 
nonetheless  no assurance can be given as to the future availability or cost of such insurance and reinsurance or that litigation losses will not exceed the limits of the insurance coverage and reserve 
in the opinion of management and based on the facts currently known  the outcome of these actions should not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company

inflation health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate and the company has implemented cost control measures and risk sharing arrangements which seek to reduce the effect of health care cost inflation 
during  the company implemented increases in premiums rates designed to offset at least a portion of inflationary cost increases while maintaining competitive rates within its markets 
quarterly results of operations the quarterly consolidated results of operations of the company are summarized in item selected consolidated financial data  supplementary financial information 
outlook the company s membership in january was approximately  members  an increase of over january the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the phc plans 
of the january membership  approximately  were risk members and approximately  were non risk members 
the company operates in highly competitive markets  but generally believes that the pricing environment is improving in its existing markets  thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to increase premiums at rates equal to or in excess of increases in its health care costs 
for  the company continues to pursue ways to improve its underwriting processes and oversight in both risk and management services products with the objective of increasing premium yields and profitable growth in its markets 
the company s migration of certain of its operating activities eg  customer service  claims processing  billing and enrollment to regional service centers is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of the company expects that the regional service centers will allow it to provide improved levels of service in a more cost effective manner 
the integration of the phc health plans has allowed the company to strengthen its balance sheet and gain entry into additional markets 
management believes that existing markets have potential for growth for the company s commercial and governmental products 
management believes that the foregoing should result in progressive improvements in  although realization is dependent upon a variety of factors  some of which may be outside the control of the company 
impact of year the company s business is significantly dependent on information systems 
the company has implemented a year readiness program designed to prevent material information system disruption associated with the millenium date change 
the program includes an inventory and review of all core application systems  networks  desktop systems  infrastructure and critical information supply chains 
the company s year readiness program can be broken down into five categories is hardware  software and networks  office equipment which relies on microchips or telecommunications  buildings and facilities  business partners and customers  and business risk and contingency planning 
it is anticipated that the program will be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of the total estimated cost of the program is approximately million  of which million has been incurred through december  the cost of year modifications is based on management s best estimates 
actual costs  however  may differ from those currently anticipated 
all year initiatives are monitored by a steering committee made up of management personnel representing the company s legal  compliance  finance  actuarial  medical and is departments 
the steering committee reports the status of the company s year readiness program to senior management who report to the board of directors 
while the company currently believes that its planning efforts and anticipated modifications to existing systems and purchases of new systems will be adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the specific phases of the year readiness program are as follows is hardware  software and networks the company has historically purchased its core software applications rather than build them 
the company is currently operating on two different platforms for its core managed health care software applications 
the former coventry corporation health plans use the idx managed care system 
the current release of that system is vendor certified to be year compliant and the company has converted its applications to that current release 
final testing of the conversion is in process 
all integration testing and operating system upgrades are scheduled for completion by may  the former phc health plans are using a different third party product  which has been customized and is no longer supported by the vendor 
that system utilizes julian dates for all internal processes and is year compliant 
as part of the company s readiness program  the entire application has been reviewed and necessary changes identified 
those programming modifications have been completed  tested and are in production 
the computer operating systems are tested and two are in production 
it is anticipated that the remaining systems will be in production by april  the company has requested all vendors of currently installed software to disclose their products current year readiness and their plan for achieving year readiness 
all internally developed systems were inventoried and plans were made to either upgrade  modify or replace them as necessary to make them year compliant 
all vendor software code except as noted is certified to be year ready 
all network and server hardware and software systems have been tested and repaired and are now year compliant with the exception of pc upgrades which will be completed by september  other major purchased applications that are non compliant are being replaced by upgraded software from vendors or replaced by new purchased systems 
those applications include replacements for the company s general ledger and financial reporting applications  a data warehouse for financial and medical information decision support  and a proposal and rating system to support the underwriting and marketing processes 
the general ledger  underwriting and data warehouse systems are complete and in production 
non critical financial and human resource systems are scheduled to be completed by july  office equipment the company has requested its significant office equipment vendors to submit year readiness statements about their products 
the company expects that it will receive substantially all of such statements by june and is determining the extent to which nonconforming office equipment should be upgraded or replaced 
second notices to non conforming or non responding vendors have been issued 
buildings and facilities all landlords and building management companies have been sent surveys with respect to each key operating and security system in company locations 
the company currently anticipates that this process will be complete by june surveys received have been evaluated to assess potential risks 
second requests have been sent to landlords and management companies that have not yet responded 
business partners and customers the company is in the process of communicating with its key business associates  such as financial institutions  third party vendors  provider and hospital networks  contractors and service providers to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues where their systems interface with the company s systems or otherwise impact its operations 
the company is assessing the extent to which its operations are vulnerable should those organizations fail to remediate properly their computer systems 
the company anticipates that these communications will be completed by june  however  the company has little or no control over the efforts of those key business associates and other suppliers to become year compliant 
certain of the services provided by those parties  particularly telecommunications providers  financial institutions and major hospitals and medical care providers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations if these services or operations are not year compliant 
risk assessment and contingency planning the company is reviewing its existing contingency plans for necessary modifications to address specific year issues  and expects to continue this process through september  as part of its contingency planning the company is analyzing the most reasonable likely worst case scenario that could result from year related failures 
the company s best estimate of that scenario  based on current information would involve a combination of major operational disruptions by its principal depository financial institutions  utility and telecommunication suppliers and its largest hospital and provider networks in its pennsylvania and missouri markets 
the company s year readiness program and contingency planning efforts are designed to prevent and or mitigate the effects of such possible failures 
risk factors risks of governmental programs and regulations the company s industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws and rules could force the company to change how it does business and may restrict the company s revenue and or enrollment growth and or increase its health care and administrative costs 
regulatory approvals must be obtained and maintained to market many of the products and services of the company 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain such approvals could adversely affect the company s revenue or the number of covered lives  or could increase costs 
the company is subject to risks associated with offering medicaid and medicare risk products  including pricing and other regulatory restrictions  potentially higher medical loss ratios and risks associated with entering new markets 
the company currently intends to continue to expand these products  and its exposure to such risks will increase 
the company s hmo subsidiaries that provide managed health care services under the federal employees health benefits program are subject to audit  in the normal course of business  by the opm  and such audits could result in material adjustments 
as discussed in government regulation  the company s financial results are also susceptible to future state and federal regulatory measures  including health care reform 
recently  the clinton administration and various leaders of the us congress have proposed legislation which could result in increased costs to managed care providers 
limitations on ability to increase revenues increases in the company s revenues will be generally dependent upon its ability to increase premiums and membership as well as the mix of the products sold 
the company s membership  excluding the membership acquired from phc  recently has shown only moderate increases 
although premium rates for managed care plans generally have increased recently  competitive pressures  regulatory restrictions and consumer preference for lower priced health care options may cause decreases or severely limit increases in the future 
the premiums from governmental programs  such as medicare or medicaid  are generally not based on an individual company s anticipated costs and cannot be adjusted by the company 
recent legislation has limited medicare premium increases substantially compared to prior years 
certain of the company s customers represent a significant percentage of the membership of one or more of its respective health plans  and the loss of one or more of such customers could cause a material adverse effect on the revenues of the company in the future 
limits on ability to project actual health care costs a substantial portion of the revenue received by the company is expected to pay the costs of health care services or supplies delivered to persons covered by its health plan and insurance products 
the total health care costs incurred by the company are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
much of the premium revenue is set in advance of the actual delivery of services and the related incurring of the cost  usually on a prospective annual basis 
while the company attempts to base the premiums it charges at least in part on its estimate of expected health care costs over the fixed premium period  competition  regulations and other circumstances may limit the company s ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs 
in addition  many factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed those estimated  including increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  seasonality  general inflation  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics 
accordingly  there may be discrepancies between reserves for incurred but not reported liabilities and the actual amount of such liabilities 
historically  increases in health care prices and utilization have caused health care costs to rise faster than general inflation 
while these increases have moderated recently  there can be no assurance that health care prices or utilization will not again increase at a more rapid pace 
risks of agreements with providers prior to  the company s st 
louis and pennsylvania health plans offered members access to company owned and company staffed medical centers  as well as to networks of contracting providers 
during  the company s medical centers were sold to provider systems which have contracted to provide care to the company s members continuing to use such centers 
the company expects that substantially all its members will be serviced by providers contracting with the company to provide the requisite medical care 
the ability of the company to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a given geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of its managed care products in those markets 
the terms of such provider contracts also have a material impact on the company s medical costs and its ability to control such costs 
in certain markets currently served by the company  certain provider systems have significant market positions  and may compete with the company 
if such provider systems refuse to contract with the company  place the company at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts unfavorable to the company  the company s product offerings or profitability in such market areas could be adversely affected 
among the medical cost control techniques the company has utilized are capitation agreements with providers pursuant to which providers are paid a fixed dollar amount per member per month under the agreement  with the provider obligated to provide all of a particular type of medical service required by the members  and global capitation agreements  pursuant to which a single integrated hospital physician provider system provides substantially all hospital and medical services to a large number of members for a fixed percentage of the premium charged by the company with respect to those members 
while these systems may shift to the contracting provider system the risk that medical costs will exceed the amounts anticipated  the company is exposed to the risk that the provider systems will be financially unable or unwilling to fulfill their payment or medical care obligations under the capitation agreements  and to the risk that members may prefer other providers in the market 
recent operating losses the company s operating loss in was primarily attributable to charges related to the establishment of reserves related to the aherf bankruptcy and the relocation of the corporate headquarters and other merger related costs 
the company s management believes that its operating results will continue to improve in and  as to which  however  there can be no assurance 
information systems and administrative expense risks the level of administrative expense is a significant factor in the company s operating results 
while the company attempts to effectively manage such expenses  increases in staff related and other administrative expenses may occur from time to time due to business or product start ups or expansions  growth or changes in business  acquisitions  regulatory requirements or other reasons 
such expense increases are not clearly predictable and increases in administrative expenses may adversely affect results 
financing risk the company s recent financial losses may make it more difficult to obtain financing on satisfactory terms in the future 
in addition  operating losses by a subsidiary may require the company to make investments in  or to refinance loans to  such subsidiary in order to maintain required capital levels 
many of the state regulatory authorities in states in which the company conducts business are expected to increase capital requirements for managed care companies in the next two years 
the national association of insurance commissioners has proposed that states adopt risk based capital standards that  if implemented  would require new minimum capitalization limits for health care coverage provided by hmos and other risk bearing health care entities 
to date  no state where the company has hmo operations has adopted those standards 
the company does not expect this legislation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position in the near future 
the company believes that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund any additional regulatory risk based capital 
risk of competition the company operates in a highly competitive industry 
in many of its geographic and product markets  the company competes with a number of entities  some of which may have certain characteristics or capabilities that give them a competitive advantage 
the company believes that there are few barriers to entry in these markets  so that the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily 
certain of the company s existing customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services formerly provided by the company resulting in a decrease in the company s revenues 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry as well as in other segments of the health care industry  both nationally and in various local markets 
this activity may create stronger competitors and or result in higher health care costs 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  the company s ability to retain or increase customers  its revenue growth  its pricing flexibility  its control over medical costs trends and its marketing expenses may all be adversely affected 
marketing risk the company markets its products and services through both employed sales people and independent sales agents 
although the company has a number of such sales employees and agents  if certain key sales employees or agents or a large subset of such individuals were to leave  the company s ability to retain existing customers and members could be impaired 
in addition  certain of the customers or potential customers of the company consider rating  accreditation or certification of the company by various private or governmental bodies or rating agencies necessary or important 
certain of the company s health plans or other business units may not have obtained or may not desire or be able to obtain or maintain such accreditation or certification which could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain or retain business with such customers 
the managed care industry has recently received significant amounts of negative publicity 
such general publicity  or any negative publicity regarding the company in particular  could adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products or services or could create regulatory problems for the company 
litigation and insurance risk the health care industry in general is susceptible to litigation and insurance risks  including medical malpractice liability  disputes relating to the denial of coverage and the adequacy of stop loss reinsurance for costs resulting from catastrophic injuries or illnesses 
the company has contingent litigation risk with certain discontinued operations 
such litigation may result in losses to the company which could have a material adverse effect on the operations  financial performance  cash flows or prospects of the company 
stock market risk recently  the market prices of the securities of certain of the publicly held companies in the industry in which the company operates have shown volatility and sensitivity in response to many factors  including public communications regarding managed care  legislative or regulatory actions  health care cost trends  pricing trends  competition  earnings or membership reports of particular industry participants  and acquisition activity 
there can be no assurance regarding the level or stability of the company s share price at any time or of the impact of these or any other factors on the share price 
management of indemnity health insurance policies upon the closing of the acquisition of the phc health plans  principal life and the company entered into a management services agreement management services agreement  a renewal rights agreement renewal rights agreement  and a co insurance agreement coinsurance agreement whereby the company manages certain of principal life s indemnity health insurance policies indemnity health insurance policies in the markets where the company does business on december   and would offer to renew such policies in force at that time 
the company has no recent experience in the management or operation of a substantial indemnity health insurance business  and there can be no assurance that existing customers will renew their existing indemnity health insurance policies with principal life while the management services agreement is effective  or that such customers will agree to renew such policies with a company subsidiary formed for such purpose chlic at the expiration of the management services agreement and there can be no assurance that benefits from the management service agreement will be realized 
the management services agreement expires on december  there can be no assurance that revenues received under that agreement can be replaced from other sources 
in addition  to the extent policy holders elect to renew the indemnity health insurance policies with principal life after december   chlic will be required to reinsure such policies which will require that chlic increase its capital by an amount estimated to be between million to million 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to restructure its operations to make existing capital available  generate sufficient funds from operations to increase chlic s capital to required levels prior to december  or will be able to raise such capital from external sources 
the company is currently in negotiation with principal life to terminate the renewal rights and coinsurance agreement 
risk of substantial beneficial ownership of the company by principal life and affiliates as a result of the company s acquisition of the phc health plans  principal life and its affiliates collectively  principal life owns approximately of the company s common stock  on a fully diluted basis 
although it has agreed to a limitation on acquiring additional shares of the company s common stock and from taking certain other actions  principal life will be permitted under certain circumstances to acquire additional shares in order to maintain ownership of up to of the common stock  and has the right to elect at least one member of the company s board of directors for each ownership of the company s common stock  until april or certain other actions are taken by the company 
after april  or after a third party acquires more voting securities than those held by principal life  there will be no restrictions on the acquisition of the company s common stock by principal life 
prior to september  as long as principal life maintains ownership of of the company s common stock  it is highly unlikely that any matter involving a shareholder vote  including the issuance of more than of the company s common stock  or an acquisition of the company by merger  consolidation  share exchange or other transaction could be effectuated if principal life were opposed thereto 
thereafter  from september and until april  principal life has agreed to vote its shares in favor of an acquisition required to be approved by shareholders that the board has recommended and has been approved by a majority of the company s shareholders  other than principal life 
after april  there will be no restrictions on the acquisition of additional shares of the company s common stock by principal life  and as a result  principal life  in addition to having an effective veto over transactions involving a shareholder vote assuming it were to continue to beneficially own of the company s common stock  could acquire over of the company s common stock and exercise actual control of the company without a vote of the remaining company s shareholders 
item a quanitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk the company s only material risk in investments in financial instruments is in its debt securities portfolio 
the company invests primarily in marketable state and municipal  us government and agencies  corporate  and mortgage backed debt securities 
the company does not invest in financial instruments of a hedging or derivative nature

the company has classified all of its investments as available for sale 
the fair value of the company s investments in debt securities at december  was million 
debt securities at december  mature according to their contractual terms  as follows actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights amortized fair cost value maturities within year   to years   to years   over years   other securities without stated maturity total short term and long term securities   the company believes its investment portfolio is diversified and expects no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuer of the debt securities it holds 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by gnma and fnma 
the company s projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of the company s market rate sensitive instruments  should potential changes in market rates occur  are presented below 
while the company believes that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible  actual results may differ 
based on the company s debt securities portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of million  or  in the fair value of the portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the debt securities portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses 
gains or losses would be realized upon the sale of the investments
