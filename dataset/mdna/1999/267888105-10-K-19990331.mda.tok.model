item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general dynamic materials corporation dmc or the company is a worldwide leader in explosive metalworking and  through its new aerospace group  is involved in a variety of metal forming  machining  welding and assembly activities 
the explosive metalworking business includes the use of explosives to perform metallurgical bonding  or metal cladding  metal forming and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds 
the company performs metal cladding using its proprietary dynaclad tm and detaclad r technologies and performs metal forming using its proprietary dynaform tm technology 
historically  the company has generated approximately to of its revenues from its metal cladding business and approximately to of its revenues from its metal forming and shock synthesis businesses 
the company expects revenues from its explosive metalworking businesses  as a proportion of total company revenues  to decline as a result of the recent amk welding  spin forge and precision machined products acquisitions 
the company s new aerospace group was formed from these three acquisitions and accounted for of the company s revenues  a percentage that should increase significantly in explosive metalworking 
clad metal products are used in manufacturing processes or environments that involve highly corrosive chemicals  high temperatures and or high pressure conditions 
for example  the company fabricates clad metal tube sheets for heat exchangers 
heat exchangers are used in a variety of high temperature  high pressure  highly corrosive chemical processes  such as processing crude oil in the petrochemical industry and processing chemicals used in the manufacture of synthetic fibers 
in addition  the company has produced titanium clad plates used in the fabrication of metal autoclaves to replace autoclaves made of brick and lead for two customers in the mining industry 
the company believes that its clad metal products are an economical  high performance alternative to the use of solid corrosion resistant alloys 
in addition to clad metal products  the explosive metalworking business includes metal forming and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds 
aerospace manufacturing 
formed metal products are made from sheet metal and forgings that are subsequently formed into precise  three dimensional shapes that are held to tight tolerances 
metal forming is accomplished through the use of traditional forming technologies  including spinning  machining  rolling and hydraulic expansion 
dmc also performs welding services utilizing a variety of manual and automatic welding techniques that include electron beam and gas tungsten arc welding processes 
the company s forming and welding operations are often performed to support the manufacture of completed assemblies and sub assemblies required by its customers 
fabrication and assembly services are performed utilizing the company s close tolerance machining  forming  welding  inspection and other special service capabilities 
the company s forming  machining  welding and assembly operations serve a variety of product applications in the commercial aircraft  aerospace  defense and power generation industries 
product applications include tactical and ballistic missile motor cases  titanium pressure tanks for launch vehicles  and complex  high precision component parts for satellites 
the company is continually working to generate solutions to the materials needs of customers in its target markets 
key elements of the company s strategy include continual improvement of its basic processes and product offerings  the internal development of new cladding and forming products and the acquisition of businesses that broaden or complement the company s existing product lines 
in july  the company completed its first strategic acquisition when it acquired the assets of the detaclad r division detaclad of ei du pont de nemours and company dupont  a complementary explosion cladding business with expertise in cladding thin metals and heat exchanger components primarily for the chemical processing  power generation and petrochemical industries 
the company completed three separate business acquisitions during on january   the company acquired certain assets of amk welding  inc amk for a cash purchase price of approximately  assets acquired consisted primarily of machinery and equipment  land and the building that houses amk s operations 
amk supplies commercial aircraft and aerospace related automatic and manual  gas tungsten and arc welding services 
on march   the company completed the acquisition of certain assets of spin forge  llc spin forge for a purchase price of approximately  that was paid with a combination of approximately  in cash  assumption of approximately  in liabilities and  shares of dmc common stock valued at  the company s management believes spin forge is one of the country s leading manufacturers of tactical missile motor cases and titanium pressure vessels for the commercial aerospace and defense industries 
principal assets acquired included machinery and equipment and inventories 
the company leases land and buildings from spin forge  llc and holds an option to purchase such property for approximately million  subject to certain adjustments  exercisable under certain conditions through january the option may be extended beyond this date under specified conditions provided that the option price must be adjusted upwards in the event that the fair market value of the property at the time of exercise is higher than million 
on december   the company acquired substantially all of the assets of precision machined products  inc pmp for a purchase price of approximately  that was paid with a combination of  in cash payments to the seller and the delivery of  shares of the company s stock valued at approximately  pmp is a contract machining shop specializing in high precision  high quality  complex machined parts used in the aerospace  satellite  medical equipment and high technology industries 
the company is leasing the land and building used in the operation of pmp and holds an exclusive option to purchase such land and building at fair market value exercisable through december subsequent to the expiration of the option term  the company has an exclusive right of first offer to purchase the land and building at fair market value 
this right of first offer is exercisable through december the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience  quarterly fluctuations in operating results caused by various factors  including the timing and size of orders from major customers  customer inventory levels  shifts in product mix  the occurrence of acquisition related costs and general economic conditions 
in addition  the company typically does not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from its customers 
quarterly sales and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of backlog as well as bookings received during the quarter 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs 
if sales do not meet the company s expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall 
in addition  the company uses numerous suppliers of alloys  steels and other materials for its operations 
the company typically bears a short term risk of alloy  steel and other component price increases  which could adversely affect the company s gross profit margins 
although the company will work with customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of any component shortages  component shortages have had  and are expected from time to time to have  short term adverse effects on the company s business 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for increased to  from  in the company s new aerospace group  which was formed in as a result of the acquisitions of amk  spin forge and pmp  contributed  to sales and thus accounted for the entire sales increase 
sales by the company s explosion metalworking group  which includes explosion bonding of clad metal  explosively formed metal products and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  decreased from  in to  in this decrease reflects a decrease in sales of explosively formed products to  in from  in due to a significant reduction in orders from a customer that accounts for a majority of such sales 
as a result of this customer no longer ordering explosively formed parts from the company  the company expects sales of explosively formed products to be less than  in gross profit 
as a result of the company s increase in net sales  gross profit for increased by to  from  in the company s gross profit margin for was  a decline from the gross profit margin of in gross profit margin for the company s explosion metalworking group decreased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for the new aerospace group was 
the large decrease in the gross profit margin for the explosion metalworking group is principally due to proportionately lower sales of explosively formed products that carry significantly higher margins than sales of clad metal plates 
as discussed above  a large explosion forming customer no longer orders product from the company and sales of explosively formed products are expected to be less than  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in the largest portion of this increase relates to  of new general and administrative expenses associated with the operations of amk  spin forge and pmp which were acquired on january   march  and december   respectively 
expenses in also include  of non recurring expenses relating to the departure of the company s former president and chief executive officer in the third quarter of general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in to support a full year of operations for the three aerospace group acquisitions and other strategic business initiatives 
after adjustment for non recurring expenses related to the departure of the company s former ceo  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in selling expense 
selling expenses decreased by to  in from  in this decrease reflects lower expense levels in a number of categories  including compensation and benefits  advertising and promotion  and consulting 
decreases in these categories were partially offset by an increase in the provision for bad debts 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in start up costs 
in the third quarter of  the company began to separately report the start up costs associated with the construction of a new facility in pennsylvania for the manufacture of clad metal plates 
start up costs for totaled  and include salaries  benefits and travel expenses for company employees assigned to this project  field office expenses and other operating expenses directly associated with this project 
the company will continue to incur and separately report start up costs in until the new facility commences operations during the last half of research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in the company is currently utilizing its engineering resources to support current manufacturing activities  including plant design and equipment acquisition activities associated with a new manufacturing facility that is under construction in pennsylvania  and does not expect to significantly increase spending on research and development projects in the near future 
income from operations 
income from operations decreased by to  in from  in this decrease is a direct result of decreased sales and gross profits from the company s explosion metalworking group  non recurring expenses in the amount of  relating to the departure of the company s former president and chief executive officer  and  in start up costs discussed above 
income from operations in for the company s explosion metalworking group and aerospace group was  and  respectively  versus income from operations of  that was generated entirely by the explosion metalworking group 
interest expense 
net interest expense increased more than threefold to  in from  in this increase is due to borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit with keybank of colorado that were required to finance the amk  spin forge and pmp acquisitions 
interest expense is expected to increase in as a result of revolving credit loans used to finance the pmp acquisition being outstanding for the full year and the initial recording of interest expense on the industrial development revenue bond financing for the new pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
interest on the industrial development revenue bonds is being capitalized during the construction period and will not be expensed until the new facility becomes operational during the second half of income tax provision 
the company s income tax provision decreased by to  in from  in  and follows the decrease in income from operations and income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate was in and in net income 
net income decreased by to  in from  in and  as a percentage of net sales  was in compared to in this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased gross profit from the company s explosion metalworking group and increased general and administrative expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for increased by to  from  in this increase was attributable to a million increase in sales of the company s formed metal products and a  increase in sales of industrial diamond services a direct result of the company s july acquisition of detaclad 
sales of clad metal products remained flat from to gross profit 
as a result of the company s increase in net sales and an improvement in the gross margin rate  gross profit for increased by to  from  in the gross profit margin rate of represented a increase from the gross profit margin rate of 
this increase in the gross margin rate is attributable to proportionately higher sales of formed metal products and industrial diamond services  both of which carry significantly higher margins than sales of clad metal plates 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for increased to  from  in this increase reflects higher spending levels in a number of categories  including compensation and benefits  legal fees including certain litigation matters and fees associated with the company s re incorporation in delaware  and amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
general and administrative expenses are expected to remain at these higher levels to support current operations  business acquisition activities and other strategic business initiatives 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in selling expense 
selling expense increased by to  in from  in this increase reflects higher spending levels in a number of categories  including compensation and benefits  advertising and promotion  and travel and entertainment expenses 
these increased spending levels are primarily attributable to staffing increases associated with the july detaclad acquisition  general business growth  and expansion of the company s domestic and international marketing activities 
selling expense  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in research and development 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in this increase reflects increased contract labor and travel expenses associated with current year new product and process development programs 
income from operations 
income from operations increased by to  in from  in this increase was primarily due to increased net sales and a significant improvement in the company s gross margin rate  and was partially offset by increased operating expenses as discussed above 
income from operations  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in from in interest expense 
net interest expense decreased to  in from  in this decrease reflects the pay down during the first half of of borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit facility with keybank of colorado that were required during the last half of and first few months of these borrowings were required to finance a portion of the detaclad acquisition and working capital requirements associated with two large orders that accounted for a significant portion of accounts receivable and inventory balances during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of income tax provision 
the company s income tax provision increased by to  in from  in  and follows the increase in sales  operating income and income before income taxes 
the effective tax rate was in and in net income 
net income for increased by to  from  in and  as a percentage of net sales  was in compared to in this increase was primarily attributable to increased net sales and improved gross profit margins 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has secured the major portion of its operational financing from operating activities and an asset backed revolving credit facility 
in connection with the detaclad acquisition  the company entered into a  asset backed revolving credit facility original line with keybank national association keybank in july of the original line was to expire on july   at which time all or part of the outstanding balance could have been converted to a term loan which would mature on july  the maximum amount available under the line of credit was subject to borrowing base restrictions that were a function of defined balances in accounts receivable  inventory  real property and equipment 
on november   the company and its bank entered into an amended and restated credit facility and security agreement which was further amended on december  the amended credit facility allows for maximum borrowings of  under the following three separate lines of credit an acquisition line of  an accommodation line of  and a working capital line of  subject to borrowing base restrictions 
beginning on september   and on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter  the maximum borrowings available under the acquisition line become permanently reduced by  with ultimate maturity on december  beginning on september   and on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter  the maximum borrowings available under the accommodation line become permanently reduced by  with ultimate maturity on december  the working capital line expires on november  at the company s option  the borrowings under the acquisition line and working capital line may be in the form of loans bearing an interest rate of to above the libor rate  depending on certain financial ratios  or loans bearing an interest rate of above the federal funds rate 
loans under the accommodation line bear interest of above the bank s prime rate 
the lines of credit are secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventory and property  plant and equipment 
outstanding borrowings at december  on the acquisition line  accommodation line and working capital line totaled   and  respectively 
in march  the company s board of directors approved the company s proposal to build a new manufacturing facility in pennsylvania at a cost of approximately million 
the project is being financed with proceeds from  in industrial development revenue bonds issued by fayette county industrial development authority ida 
the company closed its loan agreement with fayette county ida on september  and has established a bank letter of credit in favor of the bond trustee for the principal amount of the bonds plus days of accrued interest 
the letter of credit is secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and bond proceeds not yet expended for construction of the facility and purchase of related equipment 
construction of the new facility began during the third quarter of  and the new facility should become fully operational during the second half of during  the company generated  in cash flows from operating activities as compared to  in the prior year 
the principal sources of cash flow from operations in were net income of  depreciation and amortization charges of  a decrease in accounts receivable of  and increases in accrued expenses and bank overdraft of  and  respectively 
these sources of operating cash flow were partially offset by a  increase in income tax receivable and a  decrease in accounts payable 
the current ratio was at december  as compared to at december  investing activities in used  of cash  including  to fund the purchase of the pmp  spin forge and amk assets   to fund capital expenditures  and  to temporarily invest proceeds from the industrial development revenue bond issue 
capital expenditures included  on the new pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
financing activities provided  of net cash in these financing cash flows included line of credit borrowings in the amount of  to finance the purchase of spin forge  amk and pmp  and  from the issuance of industrial development revenue bonds that are being used to finance construction of the company s new manufacturing facility in pennsylvania and the purchase of related equipment 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations  funds expected to be available under its amended credit facility and proceeds from the industrial development revenue bond financing for the new pennsylvania manufacturing facility will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements of its current business operations  including those of the recently acquired amk  spin forge and pmp businesses  for the foreseeable future 
however  a significant portion of the company s sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to perform existing contracts on a timely basis  and to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect the company s ability to meet its cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
consequently  any restriction on the availability of borrowing under the line of credit could negatively affect the company s ability to meet its future cash requirements 
the company s expenditures for the pennsylvania manufacturing facility could exceed its estimates due to construction delays  the delay in the receipt of any required government approvals and permits  labor shortages or other factors 
in addition  the company plans to grow both internally and through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
increased expenditures for the pennsylvania manufacturing facility and or a significant acquisition may require the company to secure additional debt or equity financing 
while the company believes it would be able to secure such additional financing at reasonable terms  there is no assurance that this would be the case 
year compliance the year issue is the result of many computer programs being written such that they will malfunction when reading a year of this problem could cause system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of business processes 
for the past year  the company has pursued a two prong approach to the year issue 
the first prong has and continues to involve an internal evaluation of the company s computer systems 
the company has completed a risk assessment to identify year priorities by analyzing and determining whether the year related risks were low  medium or high and whether the business impact would be marginal  manageable  critical or fatal for each system and device that may be affected by the year issue 
based on this risk assessment  the company determined that its first priority would be evaluating its mrp software 
the company found this software to be year compliant as certified by the vendor and through internal testing 
the company continued this procedure for each of the areas identified during its risk assessment as follows 
the company s hardware was tested by advancing dates and checking for power off date changes and power on date changes as well as software and hardware operation at the advanced dates 
based upon those tests the company believes its hardware to be year compliant 
the company s network operating system became year compliant with the installation of a from the vendor in january the company expects that its desktop applications will be year compliant by mid with the announced patches that are forthcoming from various vendors 
finally  the company has determined through testing that its various computer controlled manufacturing equipment is either year compliant or will not have any adverse effects on manufacturing processes in the year the second prong of the company s approach  which the company began to emphasize in the second and third quarter of and expects to complete by mid  is an integrated process of working with suppliers and customers to ensure that the flow of goods  services or payments will not be interrupted because of year issues 
to achieve this  the company has been working to implement mechanical or manual workarounds even if year problems arise 
in many cases  such workarounds are already in place 
additionally  the company is requesting that its suppliers and customers include language in their material subcontractor and consulting agreements that request these third parties to be internally year capable 
however  there can be no assurance that the failure of the company s suppliers and customers to be year compliant would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company may be adversely affected by disruptions in the operations of other companies with which the company does business  from general widespread problems or an economic crisis resulting from non compliant year systems 
the company has not incurred any material historical year costs to date 
management does not have an estimate of future year project costs that may be incurred but expects such costs to be minimal since all year compliance work is expected to be performed by company employees 
management expects  but makes no assurance that  future year project costs will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
the company has not formulated contingency plans in the event that systems are not year compliant 
while management does not believe there to be significant year risks for the company  manual workarounds will be developed as part of the company s year compliance program 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems will be year compliant in time

as of december  and thereafter total fixed rate   interest rate line of credit       weighted average interest rate industrial development revenue bonds       interest rate during the year ended december   the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk on its variable rate debt 
the swap agreements  which convert a portion of the company s variable rate acquisition line of credit borrowings and all of its industrial development revenue bond borrowings to interest rates that are largely fixed  were entered into based on management s assessment of the interest rate market 
interest differentials paid or received under these swap agreements are recognized over the life of the contracts as adjustments to the effective yield of the associated debt  and related amounts payable to  or received from  the counterparties are included in the company s balance sheet 
the swap agreement associated with the company s acquisition line of credit converts  of the  outstanding at december  to a rate that is largely fixed 
the agreement expires on december  as of december   the effective rate under this swap agreement was 
as this swap agreement was entered into on december   the resultant additional interest expense which was incurred during the year ended december  was insignificant 
the swap agreement associated with the company s industrial development revenue bonds  which expires on september   converts the  obligation to an interest rate that is largely fixed 
as of december   the effective rate under this swap agreement was and the additional interest incurred during the year ended december  as a result of the swap agreement was approximately
