item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition introduction this section includes historical information  certain forward looking information and the information provided below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results about certain risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s future operating results to differ materially from the results indicated by any forward looking statements made by the company or others 
it is important that the business discussion in item of this report and the historical discussion below be read together with the discussion of risks and uncertainties  and that these discussions be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited financial statements and notes thereto 
historical information acquisitions in march  the company acquired bgs in a stock for stock merger 
the company issued million shares of common stock in the transaction 
the transaction was accounted for using the pooling of interests method  and the company has restated its prior period financial results to include those of bgs for the periods presented 
in march  the company acquired boole in a stock for stock merger 
the company issued million shares of common stock in the transaction 
the transaction was accounted for using the pooling of interests method  and the company has restated its prior period financial results to include those of boole for the periods presented 
in april  the company acquired new dimension in a cash tender offer 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase accounting method 
because the transaction closed after the end of the company s fiscal year and the transaction was accounted for as a purchase transaction  new dimension s financial results are not included in the company s financial results through march  for a discussion of the new dimension acquisition and its financial affects on the company  see the company s current report on form k dated march  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the consolidated statements of earnings bear to total revenues 
percentage of total revenue years ended march  revenues licenses maintenance total revenues selling and marketing expenses research and development expenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses general and administrative expenses acquired research and development merger related costs operating income interest and other income earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings before cumulative effect cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net earnings earnings total revenues in fiscal were billion  a increase over fiscal total revenues of million 
the increase was the result of a increase in north american product license revenues  a increase in international product license revenues and a increase in worldwide maintenance revenues 
over the three year period ending march   the company s operating expenses excluding acquired research and development and merger related costs have decreased slightly from approximately of total revenues in fiscal to approximately of total revenues in fiscal net earnings were million in fiscal  a increase over net earnings of million in fiscal the significant increase was due to increased revenues and interest income  a lower effective tax rate and the decrease in acquired research and development write offs from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in earnings from fiscal to fiscal was also affected by the restatement of bmc s financial results to include boole s financial results 
boole s fiscal year end was september and bmc s fiscal year end is march as discussed in footnote c of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the consolidated financial statements for fiscal include the results of operations of boole for the twelve month period ended march  the company s consolidated financial statements for fiscal include the audited boole financial results for boole s fiscal year ended september  based upon the unaudited boole financial results for the twelve month period ending march   the growth in total revenues would have been approximately and the growth in net earnings would have been approximately 
the primary reason for the difference in the net earnings growth rates is the loss boole incurred in its quarter ended march  associated with its acquisition of maxm systems corporation during the same quarter 
this loss is included in the boole financial results for its fiscal year ended september   but would be excluded from its unaudited financial results for the twelve month period ended march  historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  as there can be no assurance that operating income or net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be sustained at these levels 
for a discussion of factors affecting operating margins  see the discussions below under the heading certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results 
earnings per share basic earnings per share was  
and in fiscal  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share was  
and 
the increase in earnings per share from fiscal to fiscal came from the factors discussed under earnings above 
earnings per share growth was less than growth in net earnings because of increases in the number of weighted shares outstanding caused by the company s employee incentive stock option programs as explained in notes to consolidated financial statements stock incentive plans 
revenues percentage change years ended march  compared to compared to in thousands perpetual licenses north america    international    total perpetual licenses    maintenance    total revenues    the company generates revenues from product license fees for its computer software products and product maintenance fees for the associated maintenance  enhancement and support of these products 
the company generally recognizes revenue from license fees upon the execution of a software license agreement by both parties  the delivery of the underlying products and the acceptance of such products by the customer 
in transactions wherein certain of the revenue recognition criteria are not met  license revenue is deferred 
such deferred revenue is recognized as license revenue when all related criteria have been met 
maintenance and support fees are recognized ratably over the course of the maintenance and support term as defined in the software license agreement 
for further discussion of the company s revenue recognition policies  refer to the discussion below and to note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
total revenue growth in fiscal and resulted from continued demand for the company s mainframe products for the ibm os operating system and ims and db dbmss  its expansion of its distributed systems product lines and sales channels and  to a lesser extent  higher growth rates of product maintenance fees 
in fiscal and  license fees from customers licensing bmc s mainframe products for current and future additional processing capacity generated over one half of overall growth in total revenues 
increases in distributed systems license revenues and in overall maintenance fees were the other primary contributors to growth in these periods 
the growth in product license and maintenance fees in fiscal and was derived principally from products developed prior to fiscal distributed systems product revenue growth was driven primarily by customers increased adoption of distributed it systems  by growing acceptance of the company s patrol application and data management product suite and expansion of the distributed systems sales channels 
product revenue growth was only nominally impacted by price increases and inflation in fiscal and fiscal the company s customer base is diversified  with no single customer representing greater than of its total revenues in fiscal  and this customer base is nonetheless concentrated in the top  it purchasers worldwide and  by industry  in the telecommunications  financial services and other transaction intensive sectors 
the company believes that sales to repeat customers accounted for the substantial majority of total license and maintenance revenues in the periods presented 
product line revenues at march   the company marketed over software products designed to improve the availability  performance and recoverability of enterprise applications  databases and other it systems components operating in host mainframe and distributed computing environments 
the company s mainframe products accounted for approximately  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
total revenues from mainframe products grew from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the revenues from these products are driven largely by the growth in customers processing capacity  as discussed below 
the company s mainframe revenues are concentrated in its high performance utilities and administrative tools for ims and db the company s tools and utilities for ims databases collectively contributed  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company s tools and utilities for db databases collectively contributed  and of total revenues for the same periods 
combined revenues for these product lines grew from fiscal to and from fiscal to the balance of the company s mainframe products represented  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively  representing growth of from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the decline in relative revenue contribution by the mainframe product lines reflects the increased contribution by the company s distributed systems products in these periods 
total revenues from distributed systems products grew from fiscal to and from fiscal to distributed systems product revenue growth was derived primarily from increased market acceptance of the patrol application and data management product suite  the company s significant and growing investment in its distributed systems direct and indirect sales channels and higher distributed systems maintenance fees 
in fiscal and  patrol was the most significant contributor to growth in total and license revenues for distributed systems products 
for fiscal  the company s principal distributed systems management product lines were the patrol application and data management suite  the best performance management products  the patrol db database administration products  the sql backtrack application and database recovery products and the boole command post  spaceview and command mq products 
upon closing the new dimension acquisition in april  the company added the new dimension control m job scheduling products  control d output management products and control sa security administration products for distributed systems environments 
the patrol application and data management products accounted for  and of total revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively  reflecting a increase from fiscal to fiscal and a increase from fiscal to fiscal the remaining distributed systems products accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively  reflecting a increase from fiscal to and a increase from fiscal to the revenues from the company s distributed systems product offerings depend upon the continued market acceptance of the company s existing products and the company s ability to successfully develop and deliver additional products for the distributed systems environment 
the company has experienced rapid growth in its distributed systems product lines since their introduction in late fiscal the distributed systems market is highly competitive and dynamic and there can be no assurance that this growth will continue 
license revenues the company s license revenues include product license fees and capacity based license upgrade fees 
product license fees are generated from the initial licensing of a product and subsequent licenses purchased under the company s per copy  central processing unit cpu tier based licensing program 
product license fees also include fees associated with the initial licensing of a product on an aggregate processing capacity measured on a millions of instructions per second mips basis 
capacity based license upgrade fees have  to date  been generated almost exclusively by the company s mainframe products 
these fees are charged when a customer acquires the right to run an already licensed product on additional processing capacity  as measured by cpu tier or by mips 
customers may purchase this right for current processing capacity or anticipated future processing capacity 
in both fiscal and fiscal  capacity based license upgrade fees for both current and future capacity generated the company s mainframe license revenue growth 
the company s north american operations generated  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
north american license revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal capacity based license upgrade fees were the largest contributor of growth from fiscal to fiscal  followed by increased licensing of the company s distributed systems products 
international license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
international license revenues increased by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal capacity based license upgrade fees were the largest contributor of growth from fiscal to fiscal  followed by increased licensing of the company s distributed systems products 
international license revenues were slightly reduced by the strengthening of the dollar against local currencies from fiscal to fiscal and were slightly increased from fiscal to fiscal after giving effect to the company s foreign currency hedging program 
the sustainability and growth of the company s mainframe based license revenues are dependent upon capacity based upgrade fees  particularly within its largest customer accounts 
most of the company s largest customers have entered into enterprise license agreements allowing them to install the company s products on an unspecified number of cpus  subject to a maximum limit on the aggregate power of the cpus as measured in mips 
as companies increase their mips within their mainframe environment  they may elect to increase or decrease the number of underlying cpus 
regardless of which approach is utilized  additional fees are owed if the mips limit is exceeded 
substantially all of the company s enterprise license agreements include upgrade charges associated with additional processing capacity beyond the customers current usage level  and some include license fees for additional products 
the fees associated with future additional mainframe processing capacity typically comprise from one half to substantially all of the license fees included in enterprise license transactions 
the company has experienced continued demand from its largest customers for the right to run its products on increased current and anticipated mainframe processing capacity as enterprises invest heavily in their core os mainframe it systems  at lower unit cost levels for both hardware and software 
this trend has led to larger single transactions with higher per mips discounts 
the company expects that it will continue to be dependent upon these capacity related license revenue components 
with the rapid advancement of distributed systems technology and customers needs for more functional and open applications  there can be no assurance that the demand for mainframe processing capacity or the higher operating efficiencies afforded by the company s products will continue at current levels 
should demand for the company s mainframe products slow dramatically or reverse  it would adversely impact the company s mainframe license revenues and its operating results 
maintenance and support revenues maintenance and support revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll licensed products in the company s software maintenance  enhancement and support program 
enrollment entitles customers to product enhancements  technical support services and ongoing compatibility with third party operating systems  database management systems and applications 
these fees are generally incurred annually and equal to of the list price of the product at the time of renewal  less any applicable discounts 
maintenance revenues also include the ratable recognition of the bundled fees for any first year maintenance services covered by the related perpetual license agreement 
in addition  maintenance revenues include revenue recognized from professional services performed during the respective period 
the company continues to invest heavily in product maintenance and support and believes that maintaining its reputation for superior product support is a key component of its value pricing model 
maintenance revenues have increased over the last three fiscal years as a result of the continuing growth in the base of installed products and the processing capacity on which they run 
maintenance fees increase in proportion to the aggregate processing capacity on which the products are installed  consequently  the company receives higher absolute maintenance fees as customers install its products on additional processing capacity 
due to the increased discounting for higher levels of additional processing capacity  the maintenance fees on a per mips basis are typically reduced in enterprise license agreements for mainframe products 
historically  the company has enjoyed high maintenance renewal rates for its mainframe based products 
should customers migrate from their mainframe applications or find alternatives to the company s products  increased cancellations could adversely impact the sustainability and growth of the company s maintenance revenues 
to date  the company has been successful in extending its traditional maintenance and support pricing model to the distributed systems market 
expenses percentage change fiscal years ended march  compared to compared to in thousands selling and marketing    research and development    cost of maintenance services and product licenses    general and administrative    acquired research and development    merger related costs   n a total operating expenses    selling and marketing the company s selling and marketing expenses include personnel and related costs  sales commissions and costs associated with advertising  industry trade shows and sales seminars 
personnel costs were the largest single contributor to the expense growth in fiscal and fiscal selling and marketing year end headcount increased by from fiscal to fiscal  and by from fiscal to fiscal the headcount increase during fiscal was primarily attributable to significant increases in the company s services business  open systems sales representatives and technical sales support consultants 
sales commissions increased in fiscal and in fiscal  as a result of the and increases  respectively  in license revenues 
ongoing commission plan adjustments maintained sales commission expense consistent with license revenue growth in both fiscal years 
marketing costs have continued to increase to meet the requirements of marketing a greater number of increasingly complex distributed systems products and of supporting a growing indirect distribution channel 
in addition  the company has continued to invest in increasing its market presence and customer awareness 
other contributors to the increase were significantly higher levels of travel and trade show activity  consulting expenses and the opening of additional field sales offices 
research and development research and development expenses mainly comprise personnel costs related to software developers and development support personnel  including software programmers  testing and quality assurance personnel and writers of technical documentation such as product manuals and installation guides 
these expenses also include computer hardware software costs and telecommunications expenses necessary to maintain the company s data processing and development centers 
increases in the company s research and development expenses for fiscal and were the result of increased compensation costs associated with both software developers and development support personnel  as well as associated benefits 
additionally  outside consulting  recruiting  and facilities costs increased 
the company increased its headcount in the research and development organization by from fiscal to fiscal and by from fiscal to fiscal the substantial increase in headcount in fiscal resulted primarily from the addition of research and development personnel as a result of the merger with bgs in march research and development costs were reduced in all three fiscal years by amounts capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the company capitalizes its software development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
during fiscal  and  the company capitalized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of software development costs 
the growth in capitalized costs is primarily due to increases in distributed systems product development and platform compatibility efforts 
cost of maintenance services and product licenses cost of maintenance services and product licenses consists of amortization of purchased and internally developed software  costs associated with the maintenance  enhancement and support of the company s products and royalty fees 
the increase in cost of maintenance services and product licenses during fiscal is mainly due to an increase in maintenance  enhancement and support activities 
the company acquired datatools in may and thereby reduced its royalty expense significantly from fiscal to fiscal maintenance costs are increasing as a percentage of maintenance fees as the company s revenue mix shifts to distributed systems 
the company amortized million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  of capitalized software development costs pursuant to sfas no 
in these periods  the company expensed million  million and million  respectively  of capitalized software development costs to accelerate the amortization of certain software products 
these software products were not expected to generate sufficient future revenues which would be required for the company to realize the carrying value of the assets 
the company expects its cost of maintenance services and product licenses will continue to increase as the company capitalizes a higher level of software development costs and as the company builds its distributed systems product support organization 
maintenance and support of distributed systems products is much less cost effective because of the complexity and variability of the environments in which the products operate 
the distributed systems products operate in a high number of operating environments  including operating systems  dbmss and erp applications  and require greater ongoing platform support development activity relative to the company s os mainframe products 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and personnel costs within executive management  finance and accounting  customer order processing  product distribution  facilities management and human resources 
other expenses included in general and administrative expenses are fees paid for legal and accounting services  consulting projects  insurance and costs of managing the company s foreign currency exposure 
growth in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to increased personnel and related infrastructure to support the company s growth 
fiscal year end headcount within the general and administrative organizations grew by from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal acquired research and development over the past three years  the company has devoted significant resources to developing its distributed systems software solutions 
distributed systems are highly fragmented and characterized by multiple hardware  software and network components 
the applications and underlying infrastructure components are provided by many different vendors 
in executing its product strategies  the company employs both internal research and development and the acquisition of emerging technologies and  in the case of boole and bgs  established software companies 
the company believes that time to market is critical to its success in the rapidly evolving distributed systems software market  where it must compete with well established companies such as ibm  and where its products must integrate with the predominate dbms s  operating systems  network protocols and applications within the enterprise computing environment 
accordingly  the company must continuously evaluate whether it is more efficient and effective to develop a given solution internally or acquire a technology that must be completed and then integrated into its existing product architecture 
the developers of the acquired technologies are typically small  early stage software companies with minimal to no revenues  quality and documentation standards and name recognition in the marketplace 
this strategy involves a high degree of risk and is costly in that a premium is typically paid for software code that is incomplete and only partially contributes to the company s overall development plans 
over the last several years  some of the acquired technologies were successfully completed and integrated  while others were not 
the two primary areas wherein the company has focused its distributed systems technology acquisition strategy are as follows a application recovery and b distributed systems performance and availability 
an overview of the primary  research and development efforts associated with acquired technologies that were incomplete  completed or abandoned in fiscal follows 
a application recovery during the past year the company focused on developing technology that would enable customers to back up and recover all of their databases and file systems throughout the enterprise from a single point of control in a user friendly mode 
the company was also focused on building back up and recovery bu r scheduling and archiving functionality  and  more recently  on designing erp application back up and recovery technology 
pursuant to this strategy  the company acquired datatools in may  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
datatools owns certain dbms specific back up products that were sold as stand alone products 
its flagship product is called sql backtrack sql bt 
datatools was in the process of developing numerous products and enhanced versions of products  including next generation versions of sql bt for the informix platform sqi and the oracle platform sbo  as well as first generation products for the microsoft sql sbm and sybase idr sbs i platforms 
the company allocated approximately million of the purchase price to developed technology  workforce and goodwill 
the company allocated approximately million to in process research and development ipr d 
the most significant four specific development projects  which comprised million of the ipr d  pertained to the above mentioned projects 
the primary remaining efforts associated with the ipr d included code completion in several key areas  such as logical extraction and piecemeal back up and recovery  large database support and performance related functionality 
as of the acquisition date  the expected costs to complete the ipr d were  on a calendar year basis  approximately million in  million in  million in  and million in the company has made significant progress with the ipr d and continues to advance its efforts to attain technological feasibility throughout all of the underlying ipr d projects 
with respect to the estimated completion costs  the company is below the above mentioned  forecasted amounts as a result of decisions to terminate certain of the ipr d projects such as the sbs i project noted below and more efficient development efforts than anticipated 
the following summarizes the four primary projects pertaining to the datatools ipr d 
the company completed and released the sbm product in april the sbo product was released in june for both the nt and unix environments 
the ipr d was successfully completed resulting in new functionality in several areas  including back up and recovery scheduling  remote bu r  archive log management and a graphical user interface 
bmc abandoned the sbs i project based on concerns over market demand and the allocation of sybase resources to the core sybase product 
the company released version of the sbi product in april the completion of the in process technology resulted in added functionality  including selective recovery of tables  as opposed to full back ups  which increases flexibility and efficiency 
this version also allows for incremental restart if a recovery is interrupted  eliminating the need to run the entire recovery again 
in july  the company acquired certain software code from software partners  inc software partners for a total purchase price of million 
the company allocated million of the purchase price to completed technology and million to ipr d 
the allocation of purchase price to completed technology reflects the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with the customers using the existing technology 
this code permits file system back up and recovery  but was not competitive with the leading products in this market 
the company initially planned on completing this code and integrating it into its patrol recovery manager product 
these efforts were unsuccessful  and the company is now attempting to complete the code and integrate it into a planned distributed systems application recovery management product scheduled to be released in the latter part of fiscal the expected costs to complete the r d and to integrate the r d into the application recovery product are approximately million in fiscal the company believes that while the various products released in the back up and recovery space are beneficial to its customers and generate incremental revenue for the company  the value of these acquisitions to the company will only be realized upon the successful completion of an enterprise wide  integrated back up and recovery management product 
this product should provide back up and recovery functions on all major applications  databases and file systems 
patrol recovery manager  which manages sbo and sbs  was released in december in fiscal  the company plans on releasing its first comprehensive  distributed systems application recovery product  which is intended to incorporate essentially all of the company s distributed systems back up and recovery technology 
to date  the company has not generated a material amount of net cash flow from these back up and recovery technologies 
the company anticipates that it will continue to invest significantly in this area over the next few years 
if these efforts prove unsuccessful  there would be a detrimental impact on the company s financial results 
b distributed systems performance and availability in an effort to strengthen patrol s monitoring and management capabilities in the middleware arena  the company acquired certain in process technology in may from network catalyst software llc network catalyst with the intention of improving patrol s ability to measure and report on the performance of its customers applications 
the acquired code was incomplete as it had no display capability  was not scalable  supported only a few platforms and did not work with certain communication protocols 
the company completed the code  and  released its new version of patrol s knowledge module for networked applications in september during fiscal  the company completed two asset acquisition transactions 
the company was in the process of designing a middleware management product to assist customers with optimizing middleware performance and with handling enterprise environmental changes in the latter part of fiscal in this regard  in april  the company acquired a license from nastel technologies  inc nastel for certain infrastructure source code for use in its mq management product that was under development  but had not yet reached technological feasibility 
accordingly  the company allocated the entire million purchase price to ipr d 
bmc completed the acquired ipr d by creating an effective installation routine  developing an automated mq configuration routine  fortifying the underlying nastel database and modifying the code to work in environments with complementary management products 
upon completion of the ipr d  the company completed the initial related product after developing efficient data collection  user interface and business logic code 
in june  the company entered into a strategic agreement with envive corporation envive primarily to strengthen bmc s erp business management solutions to provide better diagnostic and correlation ability  service level management and end to end monitoring capability 
the company also secured the rights to distribute certain products in the sap management market 
the company s committed costs associated with the transaction approximated million 
the company allocated million of the transaction costs to software assets  prepaid royalties and interest 
the remaining million was allocated to acquired ipr d that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of the transaction 
the company believes the acquired ipr d was approximately complete towards development of end to end and service level management functionality across the major erp platforms  but there is no assurance that it will be successful in developing such marketable technology 
the company incurred a moderate level of development costs during fiscal towards completing the ipr d 
the company is in the process of evaluating the alternative levels of commitment and effort required to develop the above mentioned functionality in the non sap environments 
the range of future expenditures associated with these alternatives is million to million 
the values assigned to acquired ipr d in the above mentioned transactions were generally determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projections used to value the acquired ipr d were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
operating expenses were estimated based on historical results and anticipated profit margins 
due to purchasing power increases and general economies of scale  estimated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were  in some cases  estimated to decrease after the acquisitions 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on cost of capital calculations 
due to the nature of the forecast and risks associated with the projected growth  profitability and the developmental nature of the projects  discount rates of to were used to value the acquired ipr d 
these discount rates were commensurate with the respective stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
if the acquired ipr d projects are not successfully completed  the company s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected in future periods 
in addition  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
merger related costs in conjunction with the company s merger with boole in march  the company s management approved a formal plan of restructuring the plan which included steps to be taken to integrate the operations of the two companies  consolidate duplicate facilities and streamline operations to achieve reductions in overhead expenses in future periods 
in connection with the plan  at march  the company had accrued approximately million in merger related charges comprised principally of the following components employee related expenses including severance and other benefits  costs to eliminate duplicative facilities  transaction costs and impairment of assets to be disposed of as a result of consolidations 
this accrual represents management s best estimate of identifiable and quantifiable charges that the company will incur as a result of the actions taken under the plan 
the accrued charges at march  included estimates of involuntary termination benefits for domestic employees and international employees  located primarily in europe  including the executive management of boole and various redundant administrative and support personnel 
as part of the integration  the company will incur incremental costs to exit certain office lease arrangements as well as to make payments for idle facilities 
in conjunction with these office consolidations  the company will dispose of certain identified assets  including office furniture and fixtures and computer hardware  which have been written down to market value 
additionally  the company and boole incurred direct transaction costs to effect the merger which include fees for investment banking  legal  accounting and other professional fees  as well as approximately million for settlement of a suit brought against boole for allegedly breaching a standstill and exclusive negotiating agreement with platinum 
the company expects to substantially complete the plan within fiscal the company expects to incur other significant costs in future periods that were either not quantifiable or as to which the company had not committed to a course of action as of march   and therefore  have not been included in the accrual 
these costs could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
in addition to costs which are included in the restructuring accrual  the company will incur various incremental expenses in the near term as a direct result of integration efforts  but for which  classification as restructuring charges is not allowed under current accounting standards 
these items  such as relocation and retraining of employees and development or marketing efforts for enhanced or integrated products  could be significant to future operating results 
interest and other income interest and other income consists primarily of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and to a lesser degree  financed receivables 
interest and other income increased by from fiscal to and from fiscal to this increase is primarily due to higher interest income earned on larger invested cash and investment balances 
income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rates were  and for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company recorded a non recurring benefit to its provision for income taxes to reflect a settlement with the internal revenue service 
for further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an analysis of the differences between the statutory and effective income tax rates is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  was issued 
under sfas no 
 all items that meet the definition of comprehensive income will be reported separately for the period in which they are recognized 
the only impact is that comprehensive income  which includes changes in the balances of items that are reported separately in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets  has been reported at the bottom of the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income 
this statement became effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which  in the case of the company  was fiscal sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  was issued in june sfas no 
requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis used internally for evaluating segment performance and resource allocation 
sfas no 
became effective for the company during its march  fiscal year 
the company operates in a single segment  distributing enterprise software products 
the aicpa issued sop  software revenue recognition  in october  which replaces the previous revenue recognition rules provided by sop sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after december   which  in the case of the company  was fiscal more recently  the aicpa issued sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  in december  which provided additional guidance on sop sop is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after march   which  in the case of the company  is the fiscal year beginning april  and ending march  the adoption of sop did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company similarly believes that the adoption of sop will not materially impact the company s revenue recognition practices 
in march  the aicpa issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this standard requires that certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
this sop also requires that costs related to the preliminary project stage and the post implementation operations stage of an internal use computer software development project be expensed as incurred 
sop is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   which  in the case of the company is the fiscal year beginning april  and ending march  sop is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
redefines derivative instruments and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value  with changes in the instruments fair value to be recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
also establishes new criteria for transactions to qualify for hedge accounting 
the company elected to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in a cumulative expense adjustment of million  net of tax 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended march  and this information has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements and all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the selected quarterly information when read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results for the quarters ended june  september  and december  and march  include the historical quarterly financial results of bmc for the periods then ended  of boole for the quarters ended december   march  june  and september   respectively  and of bgs for the quarters ended april  july  and october  and january   respectively 
results for the quarters ended june  september  and december  and march  include the historical quarterly financial results of bmc and of boole for the periods then ended 
excluded from the company s quarterly results are the historical quarterly financial results of boole for the quarters ended december  and march   which included total revenues of million and million  respectively  and net earnings of million and million  respectively 
the company completed its merger with bgs in march the company s quarterly results are subject to seasonality and can be volatile and difficult to predict accurately prior to a quarter s end as discussed under certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results

an important contributor to the increase is the company s software financing program  whereby interests in its trade receivables are transferred to third party financial institutions in exchange for cash 
the company s working capital as of march   was million 
the company continues to invest cash in securities with maturities beyond one year 
while yielding greater returns  this reduces reported working capital 
the company s securities are investment grade and highly liquid 
stockholders equity as of march   was billion 
the company continues to finance its growth through funds generated from operations 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million  which included an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million  primarily related to the purchase of investment securities  acquisition of computers and related equipment  construction of a new building and increases in financial receivables 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  which derived primarily from the income tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options 
cash flow amounts presented above include adjustments necessary to conform the cash flows of boole with those of bmc 
during fiscal  the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock 
the company s board of directors terminated the share buy back program in march prior to consummation of the bgs merger consistent with the pooling of interests accounting provisions 
prior to cancellation of the share buy back program  the company was authorized to acquire  shares of its common stock under its stock repurchase program 
the company continues to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that complement the company s strategic plans 
the company had no debt as of march   other than normal trade payables  accrued liabilities and deferred tax liabilities 
as part of the company s acquisition of new dimension in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into a million credit facility with a consortium of us banks 
the facility consists of a a day revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes with renewal options by the lenders and with a one year option granted to the company to convert the revolving loans into a one year term loan  and b a competitive bid facility that allows the company to request bids from the lenders for loans on a negotiated basis up to the existing availability under the credit facility 
interest rates on the loans under the credit facility are based upon a margin above libor within current market parameters and certain financial ratios of the company 
as of june   the company had million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at an average annual interest rate of 
the credit facility includes  among others  covenants regarding maintenance by the company of at least million in cash and marketable securities and certain financial ratios 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
certain risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results this annual report and management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of sections a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which are identified by the use of the words believes  expects  anticipates  will  contemplates and would and similar expressions that contemplate future events 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect the company s operating results and could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by  or on behalf  of the company 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
these important factors  risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those described in the following paragraphs and in the discussions above  including the discussion under business competition  system dependence 
volatility of stock price  risk of litigation 
the company s stock price has been and is highly volatile 
the company s stock price is based almost completely on current expectations of sustained future revenue and earnings growth rates 
any failure to meet anticipated revenue and earnings levels in a period or any negative change in perceived long term growth prospects of the company would likely have a significant adverse effect on the company s stock price 
the company s license revenues  total revenues  net earnings and earnings per share  excluding one time charges  have accelerated in recent quarters 
this growth should not be seen as indicative of future results 
the timing and size of license contracts could cause quarterly revenues and earnings to fluctuate 
the company s revenues and results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially 
the timing and amount of bmc s license revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter extremely uncertain 
bmc generally operates with little or no sales backlog and  as a result  license revenues in any quarter are dependent upon contracts entered into or orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
most of bmc s sales are closed at the end of each quarter 
there has been and continues to be a trend toward larger enterprise license transactions  which can have sales cycles of up to a year or more and require approval by a customer s upper management 
these transactions are typically difficult to manage and predict 
failure to close an expected individually significant transaction or multiple expected transactions could cause bmc s revenues and earnings in a period to fall short of expectations 
bmc generally does not know whether revenues and earnings will meet expected results until the final days or day of a quarter 
year concerns could reduce revenues and earnings 
in addition  each customer s evaluation of its need to achieve year compliance may affect its purchase decision 
many analysts believe that many customers and potential customers are heavily engaged in testing and correcting system year problems  and therefore  such customers may choose to defer system investments during calendar  negatively impacting the company s revenues 
in addition  the company s sales cycles may lengthen in and future years due to lessened urgency of customers system investment decisions 
because year related impacts on customer purchasing decisions are unprecedented  the company has a limited ability to forecast accurately the impact of the year issue on its quarter to quarter revenues 
high degree of operating leverage 
the company s business model is characterized by a very high degree of operating leverage 
a substantial portion of the company s operating costs and expenses consist of employee and facility related costs  which are relatively fixed over the short term 
in addition  the company s expense levels and hiring plans are based substantially on the company s projections of future revenue 
if near term demand weakens in a given quarter  there would likely be a material adverse effect on operating results and a resultant drop in the company s stock price 
risks related to contraction of operating margins 
there is a risk that the company will not be able to sustain its high operating margins  which could adversely affect its earnings 
the company s operating margins  excluding one time charges  have varied from the low to mid range in recent quarters  which is at the high end of the range for peer companies 
the company does not compile margin analysis other than on an aggregated basis  however  the company believes that the operating margins associated with its distributed systems products are substantially below those of its traditional mainframe products 
since the company s mix of business continues to shift to distributed systems revenues and since research and development  sales  support and distribution costs for distributed systems software products are generally higher than for mainframe products  operating margins will experience more pressure 
the company may be unable to increase or even maintain its current level of profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
increased competition and pricing pressures could adversely effect sales 
the market for systems management software has been increasingly competitive for the past number of years and is currently intensifying 
the company competes with a variety of software vendors including ibm and ca 
if ibm is successful with its efforts to achieve performance and functional equivalence with the company s products at a lower cost  the company s business will be materially adversely affected 
the company derived approximately of its total revenues in fiscal from software products for ibm and ibm compatible mainframe computers 
ibm continues to focus on reducing the overall software costs associated with the os mainframe platform 
ibm continues  directly and through third parties  to aggressively enhance its utilities for ims and db to provide lower cost alternatives to the products provided by the company and other independent software vendors 
ibm has significantly increased its level of activity in the ims and db high speed utility markets over the last eighteen months 
ca has recently entered the mainframe database tools and utilities market with its acquisition of platinum and has announced its intention to compete with bmc in these markets 
capacity based upgrade fees associated with both current and future processing capacity contributed approximately one fourth to one third of total bmc revenues in each of fiscal years  and historically  these fees were not separately captured by boole  however  the company does not believe that the addition of boole would significantly change the contribution of these fees to total revenues 
the charging of upgrade fees based on cpu tier classifications is standard among mainframe systems software vendors  including ibm 
while the company believes its current pricing policies properly reflect the value provided by its products  the pricing of mainframe systems software and particularly the charging of capacity based upgrade fees is under constant pressure from customers and competitive vendors 
ibm continues to reduce the costs of its mainframe systems software to increase the overall cost competitiveness of its mainframe hardware and software products 
ibm also generally charges significantly less for its software products 
these actions continue to increase pricing pressures within the mainframe systems software markets 
the company has continued to reduce the cost of its mainframe tools and utilities in response to these and other competitive pressures 
decreasing demand for mainframe processing capacity could adversely effect revenues 
fees from enterprise license transactions remain fundamental components of the company s revenues and the primary source of mainframe revenues 
these revenues depend on the company s customers continuing to perceive an increasing need to use the company s existing software products on substantially greater mainframe processing capacity in future periods 
the company believes that the demand for enterprise licenses has been driven by customers recommitment over the last months to the os mainframe platform for large scale  transaction intensive information systems 
whether this trend will continue is difficult to predict 
if the company s customers processing capacity growth were too slow and or if such customers were to perceive less relative benefit from the company s current mainframe products  the company s revenues would be adversely affected 
failure to adapt to technological change could adversely affect the company s earnings 
if the company fails to keep pace with technological change in its industry  such failure would have an adverse effect on its revenues and earnings 
the company operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the distributed systems and application management markets in which the company operates are far more crowded and competitive than its traditional mainframe systems management markets 
the company s ability to compete effectively and its growth prospects depend upon many factors  including the success of its existing client server systems products  the timely introduction and success of future software products  and the ability of its products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by its products 
the company has experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past  particularly with some of its client server systems products  and expects to have delays in the future 
delays in new mainframe or client server systems product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and earnings 
new products or new versions of existing products may  despite testing  contain undetected errors or bugs that will delay the introduction or adversely affect commercial acceptance of such products 
pricing practices  product lines 
the company may choose in fiscal year or a future fiscal year to make changes to its product packaging  pricing or licensing programs 
such changes may have a material adverse impact on revenues or earnings  and such changes may cause the company to revise its guidance on future operating results 
risks related to business combinations 
as part of its overall strategy  the company has acquired or invested in  and plans to continue to acquire or invest in  complementary companies  products  and technologies and to enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances with other companies 
the company s acquisitions of datatools in may  bgs in march  boole in march and new dimension in april are the results of this strategy 
risks commonly encountered in such transactions include the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the combined companies  the risk that the company may not be able to integrate the acquired technologies or products with its current products and technologies  the potential disruption of the company s ongoing business  the inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  the inability of management to maximize the financial and strategic position of the company through the successful integration of acquired businesses  and decreases in reported earnings as a result of charges for in process research and development and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in order for the company to maximize the return on its investments in bgs  boole and new dimension  the products of these various entities must be integrated with each other and with the company s existing products 
integration of the best and command post products with patrol is also very important 
the company is integrating the mainview product line with its ims  db and other os products and the best products with the command post and mainview products  adding to the complexity of the task of integration 
each of these integrations will be difficult and unpredictable  especially given that these software products are highly complex  have been developed independently and were designed with no regard to such integration 
the difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well established  as these are  because compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved 
successful integration of these product lines also requires coordination of different development and engineering teams 
this too will be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these product integration efforts or that the company will realize the expected benefits 
with the acquisitions of bgs  boole and new dimension  the company has initiated efforts to integrate the disparate cultures  employees  systems and products 
in all three acquisitions  retention of key employees is critical to ensure the continued advancement  development  support  sales and marketing efforts pertaining to the acquired products 
the company has implemented retention programs to keep many of the key technical  sales and marketing employees  nonetheless  the company has lost some key employees 
the company has also elected to retain the principal locations of bgs  boole and new dimension and has reorganized the management structure at all of these locations 
the company has not historically managed significant  fully staffed business units at locations different from the company s headquarters 
as a result  the company may experience difficulties 
risks associated with managing growth 
the company has experienced an extended period of i significant revenue growth  ii acquisitions  iii expansion of its software product lines and supported platforms  iv significant expansion in its number of employees  v increased pressure on the viability and scope of its operating and financial systems  and vi expansion in the geographic scope of its operations 
this growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and has placed a significant strain upon the company s management  operating and financial controls and resources  including its services and development organizations 
to accommodate recent growth  compete effectively and manage potential future growth  the company must continue to implement and improve the speed and quality of its information decision support systems  management decisions  reporting systems  procedures and controls 
the company s personnel  procedures  systems and controls may not be adequate to support its future operations 
the company has recently realigned its product development and marketing operations along five product market oriented groups 
it is uncertain if this reorganization will yield the desired benefits and whether this organizational structure will prove effective 
risks related to year the company understands the importance of ensuring that its operations will not be adversely impacted by the year problem 
the company s board of directors has been briefed about the year problem generally and has established a year steering committee composed of members from key departments within the company to oversee the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive year plan 
the steering committee includes representatives from boole and new dimension to ensure that the company s year compliance efforts are equally directed to the operations recently acquired by the company 
the company s year plan addresses not only the year compliance of the software products offered by the company  but extends to the company s internal systems  such as facilities  internal information systems  as well as the company s relationships with financial institutions  suppliers and other third parties 
the company s year plan is comprised of four phases i assessment of all of the company s systems and technology  ii remediation  iii implementation and testing of modifications to or replacements of existing systems and technology  and iv contingency planning 
the company has tested the ability of its software products to process year data without interruption or errors and believes that its products are substantially year compliant 
the company is in the process of verifying the year compliance of certain of the software products offered by boole and new dimension 
despite these tests  there can be no assurance that undetected errors or defects will not exist that could cause these software products to fail to process year data correctly 
the company has proactively notified its customers as to the year compliance status of its software products and has encouraged its customers to prepare their systems in anticipation of year nonetheless  the company s customers may incur migration costs relative to systems that are not year compliant or who are using versions of the company s products that are not year compliant 
some of these customers may assert claims against the company for such costs 
the company s software products are typically used in high volume information systems that are critical to a customer s operations 
consequently  business interruptions  the loss or corruption of data or other major problems could result in significant adverse consequences to its customers 
the company cannot predict whether or to what extent any legal claims will be brought  or whether the company will suffer any liability as a result of any such adverse consequences to its customers 
the company has initiated communication with certain key business partners to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties potential failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company has consolidated its banking relationships with top tier financial institutions around the world who have represented to the company that their respective systems are year compliant 
the bank accounts and banking relationships maintained by boole and new dimension are currently being evaluated to determine their year compliance 
additionally  the company has identified its critical suppliers and has requested year compliance documentation from these suppliers respecting their products  services and supply chain 
the company expects this effort to be completed by july  the company believes that  although its risk of operational disruption from systems failures due to year issues is minimal  the company could suffer adverse consequences as a result of interruptions in electrical power  telecommunications or other critical third party infrastructure services 
in a worst case scenario  the company s computer systems could be rendered inoperable  and the company could be unable to develop or support its products 
the company has reviewed the most reasonably likely worst case scenario and is currently developing contingency plans to address such a situation 
the company operates within a modern infrastructure 
accordingly  as of june   the company has not incurred material costs in addressing year issues  and the company does not anticipate incurring material costs in implementing its year plan or developing year contingency plans 
however  there can be no assurance that the actual costs of implementing the company s year plan will not exceed the company s estimates or that the company s business will not be materially adversely affected by year issues 
risks related to international operations and the euro currency 
the company has committed  and expects to continue to commit  substantial resources and funding to build its international service and support infrastructure 
operating costs in many countries  including many of those in which the company operates  are higher than in the united states 
in order to increase international sales in fiscal year and subsequent periods  the company must continue to globalize its software product lines  expand existing and establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel  identify suitable locations for sales  marketing  customer service and development  and recruit international distributors and resellers in selected territories 
future operating results are dependent on sustained performance improvement by the company s international offices  particularly its european operations 
in this regard  the economies in europe and the pacific rim regions have been depressed in the past year 
revenue growth by the company s european operations has been slower than revenue growth in north america 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in accelerating the revenue growth of its european operations 
the company s operations and financial results internationally could be significantly adversely affected by several risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sluggish regional economic conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
generally  the company s foreign sales are denominated in its foreign subsidiaries local currencies 
if these foreign currency exchange rates change unexpectedly  the company could have significant gains or losses 
many systems and applications software vendors are experiencing difficulties internationally 
the european union s adoption of the euro single currency raises a variety of issues associated with the company s european operations 
although the transition will be phased in over several years  the euro became europe s single currency on january  the company is assessing euro issues related to its product pricing  contracts  treasury operations and accounting systems 
although the evaluation of these items is still in process  the company believes that the hardware and software systems it uses internally will accommodate this transition and any required policy or operating changes will not have a material adverse effect on future results  however  failure of any critical technology components to operate properly post euro may adversely affect business operations or require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems 
furthermore  the company s foreign exchange exposures to legacy sovereign currencies of the participating countries in the euro became foreign exchange exposures to the euro upon its introduction 
although the company is not aware of any material adverse financial risk consequences of the change from legacy sovereign currencies to the euro  conversion may result in problems  which may have an adverse impact on the company s business since the company may be required to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy these problems 
conditions in israel the company s new dimension operations are conducted primarily in israel and  accordingly  the company is directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in israel 
any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners would materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
israel s economy has been subject to numerous destabilizing factors  including a period of rampant inflation in the early to mid s  low foreign exchange reserves  fluctuations in world commodity prices  military conflicts and civil unrest 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a state of hostility has existed  varying in degree and intensity  between israel and the arab countries 
in addition  israel and companies doing business with israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by the arab countries since israel s establishment 
although israel has entered into various agreements with certain arab countries and the palestinian authority  and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the middle east  the company cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved 
in addition  certain of the company s new dimension employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
new dimension has operated effectively under these requirements since its inception 
however  the company cannot predict the effect of these obligations on new dimension s operations in the future 
inflation in israel and devaluation of the new israeli shekels could negatively impact new dimension s operating results 
although israel has substantially reduced the rates of inflation and devaluation in recent years  they are still relatively high and the company s new dimension operations could be harmed by inflation or devaluation 
if inflation rates in israel increase in the future and depress israel s economy as a whole  the company s operations and financial condition could suffer 
possible adverse impact of recent accounting pronouncements 
the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions in october  march  and december  respectively 
these standards address software revenue recognition matters  supersede an earlier sop and are effective for transactions entered into for fiscal years beginning after december  and  for sop  march  based on its reading and interpretation of these sops  the company believes that its current sales contract terms and business arrangements have been properly reported 
however  the american institute of certified public accountants and its software revenue recognition task force will continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
as the company implements its asa product strategy  it may have to change its current sales contract terms and business arrangements to meet its customers needs 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in the company s business practices could result in future changes in the company s current revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates the company operates globally and the functional currency for most of its non us enterprises is the local currency 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and of the company s consolidated revenues were derived from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating the company s foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  the company s us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to minimize the company s risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments 
the company utilizes primarily two types of derivative financial instruments in managing its foreign currency exchange risk forward exchange contracts and purchased option contracts 
forward exchange contracts are used to achieve hedges of firm commitments that subject the company to transaction risk 
the terms of the forward exchange contracts are generally one month or less and are entered into at the prevailing market rate 
purchased option contracts  with terms generally less than one year  are used by the company to hedge anticipated  but not firmly committed  sales transactions 
principal currencies hedged are the german deutschemark  british pound and the french franc  in europe  and  the japanese yen and australian dollar in the pacific rim region 
the company performs comparisons  on a monthly basis  of the purchased option contracts and the forecasted sales revenues to determine hedge correlation 
while the company actively manages its foreign currency risks on an ongoing basis  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position during fiscal years  or based on the company s foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at march   the company estimates that a near term change in foreign currency rates would not materially affect its financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended march  the company used a value at risk var model to measure potential fair value losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company 
interest rate risk the company adheres to a conservative investment policy  whereby its principle concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing its yield on such assets 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated billion at march   and were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity 
although the company s portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold 
the company estimates that a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect its financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended march  the company used a value at risk var model to measure potential market risk on its marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company
