item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated sales fiscal was the th consecutive year of record sales and the th year in the years the company has been public in which sales increased 
net sales for the year ended march   of  million increased percent over sales of the prior year of  million 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales volume of computer products resulting from the acquisition of dickens data systems  inc dickens on march  including sales of dickens with the prior year on a pro forma basis  fiscal sales increased percent compared with fiscal segment sales the company s business is classified into two operating segments computer systems products include mid range computer systems and high end platforms  storage subsystems  software  servers  personal computers  display terminals and networking products 
computer systems accounted for percent of the company s sales in fiscal compared with percent a year ago 
sales of computer systems increased percent in fiscal  primarily due to added sales resulting from the dickens acquisition discussed above 
including sales of dickens with the prior year on a pro forma basis  computer systems sales increased percent in fiscal industrial electronics products comprise semiconductors  and interconnect  passive and electromechanical products 
semiconductors are the building blocks of computer chips and include microprocessors  memory devices  programmable logic devices  and analog and digital integrated circuits 
interconnect  passive and electromechanical products are devices that move or use an electrical signal and include capacitors  connectors  resistors  potentiometers  switches and power conditioning equipment 
industrial electronics accounted for percent of sales in fiscal compared with percent a year ago 
the increase in industrial electronics sales of percent in fiscal is primarily attributable to the increased sales of the high volume  low margin semiconductor products 
gross margins the gross margin for the consolidated operations decreased to percent for fiscal from percent in the prior year 
both operating segments experienced declines as described below 
the gross margin for computer systems declined to percent of sales in fiscal from percent a year ago 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the dickens sales earning a lower gross margin compared with the other computer systems sales 
the gross margin for industrial electronics declined to percent in fiscal from percent a year ago 
the decrease is attributable primarily to the increase in sales of high volume  low margin products and to the industry s excess semiconductor supply versus demand conditions adversely impacting average selling prices 
management expects gross margin pressure to continue in the next fiscal year 
operating efficiencies warehouse  selling and administrative expenses for consolidated operations were percent of sales in fiscal  down from percent of sales in the prior year 
during  gains resulted from improvements by leveraging expenses on higher sales volume  coupled with the effects of cost controls 
efficiencies were realized through improved employee productivity and inventory turnover 
sales per employee increased to  from  in sales per employee have reflected an annual average efficiency gain of approximately percent over the past five years 
accounts receivable remained at days in inventory turnover of times increased from times in the prior year 
the resulting consolidated operating profit of million was up percent from million in consolidated operating profit was percent of sales in compared with percent of sales in  reflecting the gross margin erosion in fiscal discussed above 
the operating profit margin percent of computer systems decreased from percent of sales in fiscal to percent of sales in fiscal primarily due to the integration of dickens 
the operating profit margin percent of industrial electronics declined to percent of sales from percent of sales in fiscal primarily because of the gross margin erosion from excess capacity in the semiconductor industry referred to above 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared with million a year ago 
the increased interest expense is primarily attributable to the additional debt to fund working capital and capital expenditures needed to support the ongoing growth needs of the business  as well as the effect of the acquisition of dickens 
taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared with percent a year ago 
the tax rate decrease was primarily due to the utilization of the operating loss carryforward of the canadian subsidiary 
net income primarily as a result of the factors noted above  the company s net income for fiscal reached a record high of million an increase of million  or percent over fiscal net income of million 
diluted earnings per share for fiscal decreased to from in the previous year 
the average diluted shares outstanding increased to million in fiscal from million the prior year primarily due to the issuance of convertible trust preferred securities a year ago 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales fiscal consolidated net sales of  million increased percent over sales of the prior year of  million 
the increase was attributable to higher sales volume of computer systems 
computer systems sales increased percent in fiscal  reflecting strong demand for computer systems products 
this segment accounted for percent of sales in fiscal compared with percent in the prior year 
industrial electronics net sales decreased percent in fiscal reflecting a steady demand for interconnect  passive and electromechanical products  which was offset by a weaker sales comparison experienced by the company s semiconductor lines 
the slower pace of the company s semiconductor sales was reflective of the industry s excess of supply versus demand for that product category 
gross margins the fiscal consolidated gross margin of percent increased from percent in the prior year 
computer systems gross margin percent decreased to percent from percent and industrial electronics gross margin increased to percent from percent the prior year 
the gross margin percent changes for both segments are primarily attributable to sales mix changes 
operating efficiencies warehouse  selling and administrative consolidated expenses were percent of sales in fiscal and during  gains resulting from improvements from leveraging expenses on higher sales volume  coupled with the effects of implementation of cost controls  were offset both by added sales personnel for administration of the company s new and expanding lines and by an acceleration of expenses associated with the company s multi year computer platform project 
efficiencies were realized through improved employee productivity and receivable collections 
sales per employee increased to  from  in sales per employee have reflected an annual average efficiency gain of approximately percent over the past five years 
receivable collections were reduced to days in from days in the previous year 
however  inventory turnover of times declined from times in  reflecting a combination of increased stocking levels for recent product line additions as well as for certain of the company s existing product lines  for improved customer satisfaction 
the resulting consolidated operating profit of million was up percent from million in consolidated operating profit was percent of sales in compared with percent of sales in  reflecting the increased gross margin percent gain for both operating segments in fiscal  discussed above 
computer systems operating profit percent of sales increased to percent from percent and industrial electronics gross margin increased to percent from percent the prior year 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increased interest expense is attributable to additional debt to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements necessary to support the ongoing growth needs of the business 
taxes the effective tax rate was percent for fiscal compared with percent in fiscal the downward trend is reflective primarily of the reduction of various local and state taxes relative to the company s operations 
net income primarily as a result of the factors noted above  the company s net income for fiscal of million increased million  or percent over net income of million 
diluted earnings per share for fiscal increased to from in the previous year 
risk control systems are in place for continuous measurement and evaluation of foreign exchange exposures so that timely action can be taken when considered desirable 
reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is an integral part of the company s risk management program 
financial instruments in the form of forward exchange contracts are employed as one of the methods to reduce such risk 
the company has entered into several interest rate swap agreements for purposes of serving as a hedge of the company s variable rate credit agreement borrowings 
the effect of the swaps is to establish fixed rates on the variable rate debt and to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at march   the company had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million 
pursuant to these agreements  pioneer pays interest at a weighted average fixed rate of percent 
the weighted average libor rates applicable to these agreements were percent at march  the company extends credit based on customers financial conditions  and generally  collateral is not required 
credit losses are provided for in the financial statements when collections are in doubt 
inflation has had a nominal effect on the company s operations 
accounting changes in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company will adopt the statement in fiscal year adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop no 
 reporting on the costs of startup activities  which requires that the cost of startup activities  including organization costs  be expensed as incurred 
adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company and is required for the company s fiscal year ending march  acquisitions on march   the company acquired percent of the outstanding capital stock of dickens data systems  inc for million in cash 
dickens data systems  inc was one of ibm s largest distributors of mid range computer systems  and had total sales approximating million for the fiscal year ended march  management believes the acquisition will expand the company s customer base and product offerings and enhance the company s ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in the mid range computer systems market 
the acquisition was funded with borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired approximated million  and is being amortized over years 
in november  the company purchased an initial minority equity interest in world peace industrial co  ltd 
wpi of taiwan 
subsequent to year end  in april  the company added to its investment in wpi 
management believes this investment will provide the company with access to an extensive distribution network in the asia pacific region 
headquartered in taipei  wpi has offices in countries throughout the region  including singapore  south korea  thailand  malaysia  mainland china and hong kong 
this minority interest investment is recorded on the cost basis and is included in other assets 
in april  the company purchased an initial minority equity interest in eurodis electron plc eurodis  a pan european distributor of electronic components 
subsequent to year end  in may  the company added to its investment in eurodis 
this investment furthers the company s growth strategy by offering it access to what management believes is a very broad industrial electronic components market  as well as one of the world s largest telecommunications markets 
headquartered near london  eurodis employs  people in countries and has operating centers in the united kingdom  austria  the netherlands  belgium  france  germany  italy  switzerland and eastern europe 
liquidity and capital resources current assets including cash and cash equivalents decreased million and current liabilities decreased million for the year ended march   resulting in an increase of million of working capital 
despite increased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal over the same quarter a year ago  improved inventory turnover for the current year quarter of times compared with times a year ago resulted in reduced current asset needs 
the decrease in current liabilities is primarily attributable to reduced inventory funding requirements and to timing differences in payments 
the current ratio was at march   and at year end march  in april  the company issued an additional million of preferred securities upon exercise of an overallotment option in connection with issuance of convertible trust preferred securities by the company in march of million 
the company s revolving credit facility has a total capacity of million  substantially all of which may be borrowed as of march   in accordance with availability requirements which are subject to meeting certain minimum ratios 
as of march   million was borrowed under the facility 
a year ago  such borrowings aggregated million 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal this spending reflects ongoing initiatives designed to improve efficiencies through computer enhancement of operating processes as well as expanded facilities 
management estimates that capital expenditures will be in the range of million in fiscal during fiscal  total interest bearing debt decreased by million 
the decrease in debt is primarily attributable to improved inventory turnover in fiscal and application of proceeds of the april sale of preferred securities 
the ratio of interest bearing debt to capitalization including convertible trust preferred securities as equity was percent at march  compared with percent a year ago 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and amounts available under its credit facility are sufficient to fund its working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
information technology systems the company capitalized approximately million over the past two years in connection with the acquisition and installation of an upgraded information technology system 
amounts representing approximately million of these expenditures were operational in fiscal and million are planned to become operational in fiscal the balance of million represents work in process components which are not yet operational 
the company is evaluating these components and presently has no reason to believe that they will not become operational 
in addition  management believes there would be no material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company should such components require further modification or replacement 
it is contemplated that plans for completing the balance of the information technology it system installation will be finalized in fiscal year readiness disclosure the year problem software  hardware or an embedded chip that does not correctly process date information for years after results from the practice of storing date information with only the last two digits of the year 
the company began to address year issues in since  the company has employed internal and external resources to assist it in identifying  remediating and testing year problems 
the company has also assembled a multi departmental year task force to coordinate and facilitate its year efforts and provide regular updates to the board of directors 
the scope of the year readiness effort includes the company s internal it systems  such as hardware and software  non it systems with date sensitive characteristics  and the status of key third parties  including suppliers  service providers and customers 
the company s major it applications are currently year ready 
remediation and testing of the balance of the it systems are expected to be completed by july the company continues with analyzing the readiness of non it systems and anticipates that remediation and testing of any non compliant systems will be completed by october the company also is taking steps to determine the compliance of key third parties and expects that it will have received and reviewed responses from the majority of such parties by october although the company expects to meet the target dates for completion of remediation and testing and for determining the status of key third parties  the task force continues with developing contingency plans should the programs not be completed when anticipated or should the third parties not be ready on a timely basis 
although the company anticipates the adoption of contingency plans including the use of manual systems  use of alternative systems or other means to prevent the more important it systems from failure should serve to mitigate potential losses arising from year disruptions in connection with the company s it system  there can be no assurances that disruptions will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
despite the company s efforts of canvassing its more critical third party suppliers for compliance with year issues and identifying alternate sources  it is more difficult to anticipate the effect of the actions of such third parties on the financial status of the company 
the company has not become aware of any third party non compliance not in the process of remediation that might result in a major disruption 
costs of the initiative to date approximate million 
it is anticipated that an additional million will be incurred to complete the program 
substantially all of these outlays are expected to result from remediation of existing systems as opposed to replacing existing systems 
costs of the initiative are being funded from operating cash flows 
the actual costs of the company s year efforts may vary from current estimates  which are based on information available at the time 
at the present time  the company believes that the greatest threat posed to it by the year problem is potential litigation arising out of any failure of products sold or services performed by the company due to year non compliance  however the company is not currently aware of any threatened litigation 
based on currently available information  the company is unable to quantify losses  if any  it may incur as a result of any year non compliant products or services sold by it  and cannot provide any assurance that such losses may not be material 
the company believes that its exposure to liability resulting from the malfunction of year non compliant products is mitigated in substantial part by certain manufacturers warranties that are passed through to the customer 
regardless of whether the company is ultimately held liable for any customer s losses  the costs of defending customer lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  depending on the number and nature of such actions 
due to the uncertain number and nature of such lawsuits  the company is unable to estimate its potential litigation expenses resulting from any year non compliance of products or services sold by it 
although the company believes that it is taking appropriate precautions against disruption of its systems due to the year issue  there can be no assurance that the company will identify all year problems in advance of their occurrence  or that the company will be able to successfully remedy all problems that are discovered 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s third party relationships will not be adversely affected by year issues 
while the company does not anticipate that costs of year disruptions will have a material adverse effect  year disruptions  arising either from within the company or through third party relationships  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
subsequent event on may   progen technologies  inc  one of the company s major customers  filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the central district of the state of california 
progen subsequently filed a motion  which was granted on june   to convert its chapter proceeding to a chapter proceeding 
at the time of its initial filing  progen owed the company approximately million for the shipment of microprocessors million at march  
the company intends to pursue its rights in the bankruptcy proceedings  and  at this time  management anticipates any effects resulting from this matter will not result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
forward looking information portions of this report contain current management expectations which may constitute forward looking information 
the company s performance may differ materially from that contemplated by such statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below 
competition the company is a distributor in the industrial electronics and computer systems industry  which has been highly competitive in recent years 
the company faces intense competition in two major respects in obtaining sources of supply for the products distributed  and in developing relationships with customers 
in the case of semiconductor and computer systems products  the company competes for customers with other distributors as well as with some of its suppliers 
some of the company s competitors are larger and more established and have greater financial and other resources  which may enable them to compete more effectively 
also  it is possible that an increasing number of suppliers may decide to distribute their products directly to the customer  which will heighten competitive pressures further 
due to continuing competitive pressures  the company s gross margins have declined in recent years  and the company expects a continued downward pressure on gross margins in the foreseeable future 
softening in the computer network and platform market the company distributes many products that are used in the manufacture or configuration of mid range computer systems and high end platforms 
the technology used in these products has changed rapidly over the last several years  resulting in short life cycles for these products 
because the company s customers have been forced to replace systems that have become technologically obsolete in a relatively short period of time  the company has experienced substantial demand for these products that has contributed significantly to its revenue growth 
a slowdown in this market could have a substantial negative effect on the company s revenues and results of operations 
fluctuations in semiconductor supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand associated with technology changes and supply capability occurring from time to time 
at times when product supply has been high relative to demand  prices for those products have declined 
the company has attempted to minimize the effect of these price fluctuations in its distribution arrangements 
the company s gross margins may nevertheless be negatively affected if an excess supply of semiconductors causes a general decline in prices for those products 
if there is a shortage of semiconductor supply  the company s results of operations will depend on how much product it is able to obtain from suppliers to sell and how quickly the company receives shipments of those products 
there can be no assurance that supply and demand fluctuations in the semiconductor market will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and business 
risks related to rapidly changing technology the company s results of operations will depend in part on successful management of the challenges of rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards characteristic of the market for industrial electronics and computer systems products 
these challenges include predicting the nature and timing of technological changes and the direction of evolving industry standards  identifying  obtaining and successfully marketing new products as they emerge  and minimizing the risk of loss due to inventory obsolescence 
some of the company s competitors may be able to market products that have perceived advantages over the products distributed by the company or that render the products distributed by the company obsolete or more difficult to market 
although the company attempts to minimize the effects of inventory obsolescence in its distribution arrangements  the company may have high inventories of unsold product if a new technology renders a product distributed by the company less desirable or obsolete 
in addition  customers may be less willing  for financial or other reasons  to purchase the new products necessary to use new technologies 
dependence on key suppliers during fiscal the company s three largest suppliers accounted for percent of total sales  with ibm  compaq including digital equipment corporation and intel corporation supplying percent  percent and percent  respectively  of the company s sales volume 
although the company believes that its relationships with suppliers are good  there can be no assurance that the company s suppliers will continue to supply products to the company on terms acceptable to the company 
the loss of any of the company s three top suppliers or a combination of other suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
industry consolidation the industrial electronics and computer systems products distribution industry has become increasingly concentrated in recent years as companies have combined or formed strategic alliances 
if this trend continues  new business combinations or strategic alliances may have a competitive advantage if their potentially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources allow them to negotiate relationships with suppliers that are more favorable than the company s relationships with its suppliers 
if such relationships develop  these new business combinations or strategic alliances may be able to offer lower prices that could precipitate an industry wide decline in prices 
this decline would have a negative impact on the company s gross margins  and could cause a decline in the company s revenues and loss of market share 
risks related to growth through acquisitions the company constantly reviews acquisition prospects that would complement its existing business  augment its market coverage or provide opportunities to expand into new markets 
the company s continued growth depends in part on its ability to find suitable acquisition candidates and to consummate strategic acquisitions 
if the consolidation trend in the industry continues  the cost of completing acquisitions could increase significantly 
to fund rising acquisition costs  the company may issue equity securities  which could dilute the holdings of existing equity holders  or incur debt  which could reduce the fixed charge ratio and result in overleveraging 
these actions  and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations or the price of the company s common shares 
furthermore  acquiring businesses always entails risk and uncertainties 
the company s may not be able to integrate the operations of the acquired businesses successfully  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
leverage at march   the company s borrowings under a million revolving credit facility with national city bank  cleveland  ohio  as agent for itself and a syndicate of other lenders  totaled million 
in addition  the company issued million principal amount of percent senior notes due in august in march and april  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  the pioneer standard financial trust  issued a total of million of percent mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities  which is an equity related security 
the sole assets of the pioneer standard financial trust are million aggregate principal amount of percent series a junior convertible subordinated debentures due march  the company has executed a guarantee providing a full and unconditional guarantee of the trust s obligations under the trust preferred securities 
as a consequence of the company s obligations  a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations must be dedicated to servicing these obligations and will not be available for other purposes 
furthermore  the company s obligations may limit its ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions  and its flexibility to react to changes in the industry and changing business and economic conditions 
the company s ability to satisfy its existing obligations will depend upon its future operating performance  which may be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors described in this prospectus  many of which are beyond its control 
the company currently anticipates that funds from current operations  available credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide adequate funds to finance capital spending and working capital needs and to service its obligations as they become due 
if the company experiences difficulty in servicing its obligations  the company may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  restructure or refinance its indebtedness or seek additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
uneven pattern of quarterly sales in the company s recent experience  a disproportionate percentage of quarterly sales have occurred in the last week or last day of the fiscal quarter 
this uneven sales pattern makes the prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult  and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
the company believes that this pattern of sales has developed as a result of several factors 
one such factor is the recent tendency of customers to delay purchases until the end of a quarter in the hope of receiving more favorable pricing 
another factor is that customers may not be able to determine until close to the end of their fiscal year whether there are available funds in their capital budgets for the purchase of industrial electronics and computer systems products 
although the company is unable to predict whether this uneven sales pattern will continue over the long term  the company anticipates that  for the foreseeable future  the majority of its sales will continue to occur in the final days of the quarter 
year see the discussion above under the caption year readiness disclosure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to continuing fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rates that can affect the cost of operating and financing 
accordingly  the company addresses a portion of these risks through a program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company s objective is to reduce earnings volatility associated with these fluctuations 
the company does not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the revolving credit facility s various floating rate pricing mechanisms 
this interest rate exposure is managed by interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on a portion of the debt and the use of multiple maturity dates 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from march  rates  and assuming no changes in debt from the march  levels  the additional annual expense would be approximately million on a pre tax basis 
the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in foreign currencies creating foreign exchange risk  the primary foreign currency being the canadian dollar 
monthly measurement  evaluation and forward exchange contracts are employed as methods to reduce this risk 
at march   one forward exchange contract existed with a maturity of thirty days
