our fiscal year begins on july and ends on june financial information for the years ended june   and with respect to our operating segments appears in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have filed a registration statement with the sec on form s to offer  shares of our common stock to the public  and we anticipate completing the offering in september  if market conditions are favorable 
in april  we distributed to our stockholders all of our stock in our former subsidiary  midway games inc  a coin operated and home video game design  marketing and publishing business 
since this distribution  we manufacture  under a contract  the coin operated video games designed and sold by midway 
the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of our former video game business are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our principal executive offices are located at north california avenue  chicago  illinois  telephone number company overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of innovative video and reel spinning gaming machines  video lottery terminals and pinball games 
our primary focus is the growth of our gaming machine business 
we seek to develop gaming machines that offer greater entertainment value than traditional slot machines and generate greater revenues for casinos and other gaming machine operators 
our gaming machines incorporate secondary bonus rounds  advanced graphics  digital sound and engaging game themes  some of which include popular songs and recognized trademarks 
our gaming machines are installed in all of the major gaming jurisdictions in north america and in several foreign jurisdictions 
our revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in june  we introduced reel em in  our first single themed multi coin  multi line video gaming machine that incorporates a secondary bonus game 
our multi coin  multi line gaming machines accept up to coins at a time and have up to nine distinct pay lines  which gives the players more ways to win 
in addition  secondary bonusing creates a game within a game that rewards players by offering them a chance to advance from the primary game to a secondary game 
the secondary game also gives the players additional payoff opportunities and allows them to interact with the game by choosing from various entertaining options in the bonus round 
the success of reel em in led to our introduction of a series of video gaming machines based on this new generation design 
this series includes winning bid  top banana  filthy rich  jackpot party  life of luxury  boom and instant winner  each featuring a unique and entertaining theme 
the multi coin  multi line and secondary bonus features and our highly entertaining themes are designed to attract new players  encourage repeat play and increase the average wager per play 
in the fall of  we introduced a series of four monopoly themed gaming machines that were named the most innovative gaming product for at the american gaming  lodging and leisure summit 
we are the exclusive worldwide licensee of the widely recognized monopoly trademark for use on gaming machines 
since their introduction  these machines have typically generated average daily revenue significantly in excess of the average daily revenue of the casinos other gaming machines 
as a result of their superior earnings  we have been able to offer our monopoly themed gaming machines to casino operators on a revenue participation or daily lease basis 
this allows us to share in the superior earnings of these gaming machines and to generate a recurring revenue stream for us 
as of august   we had installed a total of  monopoly themed gaming machines 
we are also the world s leading pinball game designer and manufacturer 
we recently developed a new generation platform for pinball games  pinball  that integrates a fully interactive video monitor with the traditional playfield 
we introduced our first pinball game  revenge from mars  in march and our second pinball game  star wars episode i  in july we also manufacture coin operated video amusement games for midway 
industry overview gaming machine industry we believe that casino operators are focusing on increasing revenue growth at their existing casinos 
the importance of slot revenue to the casino operators profitability has created significant demand for gaming machines that have the ability to generate superior earnings per machine 
as a result  the pace of innovation in gaming machine design has accelerated  and gaming equipment manufacturers have increasingly focused on enhancing the overall entertainment value of gaming machines 
we believe that the two most significant recent developments in gaming machine design have been the development of video gaming machines that simulate reel spinning slot machines and the introduction of gaming machines with secondary bonus rounds video gaming machines that simulate a reel spinning slot machine on a video screen are predominantly multi coin  multi line gaming machines that offer multiple distinct paylines and allow up to coins to be wagered on a single play 
this tends to increase the average wager per play 
we believe that multi coin  multi line gaming machines are currently the fastest growing segment on the casino floor 
secondary bonusing  or the game within a game concept  allows a player to advance beyond the primary round into a bonus round if the player obtains a certain result in the primary round 
the bonus round is designed to create significant player appeal by giving the player various unique interactive options and a sense of investment in the game 
this encourages the player to continue to play the machine in an effort to achieve the bonus round 
in addition  the bonus round gives designers an opportunity to incorporate additional entertaining content into the gaming machines 
over the next few years  we expect significant demand for multi coin  multi line video gaming machines and other gaming machines that offer the player secondary bonus rounds and other enhanced entertainment features  which we believe will result in higher revenue per machine for casinos 
some of the new generation gaming machines with secondary bonusing features and entertaining themes earn significantly more than the older gaming machines on the casino floors 
as a result  gaming machine manufacturers have been able to lease some of these machines to casino operators for a revenue participation percentage or  in jurisdictions where this is not permitted  for a fixed daily lease fee 
this allows gaming machine manufacturers to share in the superior earnings of these games and to generate a recurring revenue stream for themselves 
video lottery terminals vlts include both video and reel spinning gaming machines 
vlts are purchased  leased or operated on a revenue participation basis to raise revenue for the jurisdictions where they are placed 
most vlts are linked to a central computer for accounting and security purposes and are monitored by the state lotteries or other government authorities 
unlike gaming machines designed for the casino market  most vlts are located in places where casino type gaming is not the principal attraction  such as racetracks  bars and restaurants 
pinball industry pinball games are found in amusement arcades  family entertainment centers  restaurants  bars  bowling alleys  convenience stores and movie theaters  primarily in europe and north america 
we believe that there are at least several hundred thousand coin operated pinball games installed throughout the world  although no reliable figures are available 
the worldwide pinball market has declined from a high of approximately  units sold in to a low in of only about  units sold 
we believe that this decline was caused by increased competition from other forms of entertainment  including coin operated video games and home entertainment systems  as well as by a lack of design innovation 
in our experience  however  the pinball market has been cyclical  recovering when a new generation of pinball technology is introduced 
the only manufacturers of pinball games today are wms  with about a two thirds market share  and sega pinball 
business strategy our business strategy is primarily focused on the growth of our gaming machine business 
we intend to increase our market penetration in the major north american gaming jurisdictions 
we also plan to expand distribution to new gaming jurisdictions and international markets 
we seek to increase our market share and profitability by offering an expanding portfolio of entertaining gaming machines with higher earning potential 
this strategy includes the following elements leverage our strength in developing gaming machines with enhanced entertainment value for over half a century  we have been designing successful amusement games with creative and compelling content and the latest technology 
we believe that this experience allows us to create gaming machines that offer significantly greater entertainment value than traditional gaming machines 
our gaming machine development teams combine the talents of about engineers  designers  artists and musicians 
we believe that we are well positioned to develop gaming machines that have superior entertainment value and generate higher revenue for our customers 
maximize the potential of our leasing arrangements and exclusive license for use of the monopoly theme on gaming machines as the exclusive licensee of the monopoly name for use with gaming machines  we have converted a popular trademark into a successful line of superior earning gaming machines 
the success of these monopoly themed gaming machines has allowed us to lease them to casino operators  generating a recurring revenue stream for us 
we anticipate introducing additional gaming machines that we expect to offer only on a recurring revenue basis  including additional monopoly themed machines 
focus on the multi coin  multi line video gaming machine market we believe that the fastest growing product on the casino floor is the multi coin  multi line video gaming machine 
we believe that the growth of this type of gaming machine will continue because they offer more interactive entertainment value and because casino managers wish to increase the diversity of the gaming machines on their slot floors 
our portfolio of multi coin  multi line video gaming machines has established us as a leading supplier of this type of video gaming machine 
we expect to increase the rate at which we introduce these machines in the future 
the pinball market has declined significantly in recent years due to the growth of competition from video and other amusement games 
historically  however  the pinball market has been cyclical  recovering when a new generation of pinball technology is introduced 
therefore  we have invested in the new technologies behind pinball pinball games integrate a fully interactive video monitor with traditional playfield action 
our strategy to maintain our position as the leading designer and manufacturer of pinball games is to introduce at least two to three new pinball games each year in order to offer our distributors and players a continuing variety of new games with engaging game themes 
we introduced our first pinball game  revenge from mars  in march and have sold approximately  revenge from mars pinball games  which is the largest number of units of any pinball game sold since we introduced star wars episode i  our second pinball product  in july we are developing a third pinball game that we intend to introduce in the second half of fiscal we believe that pinball products are the most advanced and entertaining pinball games designed to date 
we intend to continue to evaluate the market potential of pinball to determine whether this new platform has succeeded in stimulating a recovery in the pinball market 
products gaming we have established a fast growing line of video and reel spinning gaming machines and vlts incorporating highly entertaining themes and innovative gaming features 
our gaming machines technological features include dotmatrix animation dotmation displays for reel spinning slot machines  touch screen video displays for video gaming machines  advanced graphics and our digital compression dcs sound system dcs music  voice overs and sound effects 
engaging and humorous themes and a high degree of player interactivity are incorporated into each of our games  particularly in the secondary bonus round 
we believe that by designing gaming machines that are fun and interesting to play and incorporate the latest gaming technologies  we supply gaming machines with superior player appeal 
our gaming machines integrate a secondary bonus round with the traditional gaming machine to create a game within a game for more exciting and interactive play 
as players achieve various milestones in the primary round  they move on to play a secondary round for additional bonuses 
the secondary round gives the player a sense of investment in the game 
the player is encouraged to continue wagering in the hope of entering the bonus round 
the player can win in both the primary round and the secondary round 
in our secondary rounds  the player has various choices to make regarding the bonus features 
for example  in some games the player can select from a variety of tokens or characters that will be used to obtain or reveal the bonus 
amusing or familiar graphical and musical themes add to the player appeal of our gaming machines 
monopoly themed gaming machines

we offer a variety of multi game and single themed vlts 
our vlts may be operated as stand alone units or may interface with central monitoring computers operated by governmental agencies 
our vlts are located in places where casino type gaming is not the principal attraction  such as racetracks  bars and restaurants 
pinball and cabinets pinball we are the world s leading designer and manufacturer of pinball games 
for over years  wms and our predecessors have been making innovative and highly entertaining pinball games  which are presently sold under the williams and bally trademarks 
we believe that we obtained our leading market share as a result of the action and humor that we design into our games  as well as our innovations in design and engineering 
these innovations include cd quality music and sound effects  multi level playing fields  multi ball releases and a high level of mechanical reliability 
our new generation of pinball games  pinball  integrates a fully interactive video monitor with traditional playfield action 
virtual images are projected onto the playfield  allowing the ball to interact with video targets as well as traditional d targets 
for example  the ball appears to destroy martians or space ships  and the video display illustrates the destruction in dramatic fashion 
images on the video screen move and are transformed during the play depending on the movement of the balls 
the new stereo sound system places speakers closer to the player for maximum enjoyment at any volume level 
there may be multiple balls in play at one time  and the ball may move onto more than one level on the playfield for added excitement 
we believe that pinball products are the most advanced and entertaining pinball games designed to date 
we also believe that our modular pinball machines offer the best mechanical reliability and serviceability in the industry for the following reasons this new platform is modular  allowing the games to be changed by replacing the software  artwork and removable playfield 
conversion kits are expected generally to be installable in less than half an hour on site and are expected to be sold for about  compared to about  for a new game 
therefore  the machine owners will be able to upgrade to a new game easily and cost effectively 
the location owner can service the machine without calling the operator 
for example  the owner can clean the playfield and clear ball jams 
this is because  for the first time  the playfield is accessible by the location owner 
this feature significantly decreases down time and service costs 
the advanced design of this platform uses fewer moving parts  and therefore these machines require less frequent service than older models 
we introduced our first pinball game  revenge from mars  in march  our second pinball product  star wars episode i  in july and anticipate introducing our third pinball game in the second half of fiscal cabinets in addition to manufacturing wooden pinball cabinets  we also make and sell wooden cabinets and other wooden products to midway  under a cabinet supply agreement  and to other third parties from time to time  primarily for coin operated video games

we are continually developing new games in order to broaden our product line  introduce new technologies and enhance player appeal 
our gaming machines are usually designed by our internal gaming design teams or in some cases by independent designers under contract to us 
gaming machines must be approved and sometimes tested by certain regulatory authorities before being marketed in a particular gaming jurisdiction 
our pinball games are designed exclusively by our internal design teams 
the game design teams operate in a studio environment that encourages creativity  productivity and cooperation among design teams 
as of august  we employed about persons in our gaming machine design  research and development teams and persons in our pinball design  research and development teams 
during the fiscal years ended june    and  we spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  on design  research and product development 
while we primarily seek to develop original proprietary games  certain of our gaming machines and pinball games are based on popular intellectual properties licensed from third parties  such as hasbro and lucasfilm 
typically  wms is obligated to make certain minimum guaranteed royalty payments over the term of the license and to advance payment against those guarantees 
in addition  each license typically provides that the licensor retains the right to exploit the licensed property for all other purposes  including the right to license the property for use with other products 
sales and marketing gaming we are authorized to sell our gaming machines directly to casinos in over north american jurisdictions and in several other gaming jurisdictions 
generally  we sell our gaming machines directly in order to maximize customer service and to enhance profitability 
our gaming machines are often installed in casinos on a trial basis  and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the customers 
in addition  we have begun to place our gaming machines under revenue participation or daily rental leases 
we sell or lease vlts  depending on the jurisdictions where they are placed 
we sell and lease our gaming machines through salespeople in offices in several united states locations and a sales service consultant in canada 
our salespeople earn a salary and commissions based on sales volume

pinball games are marketed through trade shows  promotional videotapes  our website and advertising in trade publications 
in addition  we operate an internet locator on our website through which players can find our pinball games  wherever they are located  around the world 
distributors customers no one customer accounts for greater than of our revenues 
however  our largest pinball distributor and its affiliates account for approximately of our pinball and cabinets revenues 
in our opinion  the loss of a single distributor or customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we were to lose a distributor  we believe that we could make arrangements with alternate distributors for the distribution of our products 
export sales export sales of our products  primarily of pinball games to western europe  were approximately million  or of total revenues  for fiscal  compared with million  or of total revenues  for fiscal and million  or of total revenues  for fiscal substantially all foreign sales are made in united states dollars under letters of credit

contract manufacturing during the term of the manufacturing agreement  wms will not experience competition for the manufacture of midway s coin operated video games  however  the manufacturing agreement may be terminated on six months notice

manufacturing gaming we manufacture our gaming machines in our facility in chicago  illinois 
we believe that this facility is adequate for our current and planned gaming production needs

gaming machines are generally warranted for a period of days 
the raw materials used in manufacturing our gaming machines include various metals  plastics  wood and glass obtained from numerous sources 
in addition  numerous component parts  including electronic subassemblies and video monitors  are purchased from suppliers

contract manufacturing we manufacture midway s coin operated video games in our facility in waukegan  illinois

backlog we believe that it is not meaningful to compare backlog orders at the end of fiscal years since the amount of backlog orders varies from the beginning to the end of a normal two to six month production period of a pinball game and during the on going production period for certain models of gaming machines  which can extend over a period of years 
patent  trademark  copyright and product protection each gaming machine and pinball game title may embody a number of separately protected intellectual property rights  including trademarks  copyrights and patents

recent nevada legislation on may  legislation became effective in the state of nevada imposing additional requirements on persons who provide gaming machines to casino customers on a revenue participation basis 
among other things  the new law requires these persons to pay their full proportionate share of license fees and taxes imposed on gaming revenues generated by these participation gaming machines 
although the new law imposes some additional costs upon us  we do not believe that these costs will be material to our business

we and our gaming machines have been properly licensed and approved or have applied for licensure and approval in all jurisdictions where our operations require licensure and approval 
native american gaming regulation numerous native american tribes have become engaged in or have licensed gaming activities on indian lands as a means of generating tribal governmental revenue 
we manufacture and supply gaming equipment for native american tribes 
gaming on native american lands  including the terms and conditions under which gaming equipment can be sold or leased to native american tribes  is or may be subject to regulation under the laws of the tribes  the laws of the host state  the indian gaming regulatory act of igra  which is administered by the national indian gaming commission the nigc and the secretary of the us department of the interior the secretary  and also may be subject to the provisions of certain statutes relating to contracts with native american tribes  which are administered by the secretary 
as a precondition to gaming involving gaming machines  igra requires that the tribe and the state enter into a written agreement a tribal state compact that specifically authorizes such gaming  and that has been approved by the secretary  with the notice of approval published in the federal register 
tribal state compacts vary from state to state 
many require that equipment suppliers meet ongoing registration and licensing requirements of the state and or the tribe and some impose background check requirements on the officers  directors and shareholders of gaming equipment suppliers 
under igra  tribes are required to regulate all commercial gaming under ordinances approved by the nigc 
these ordinances may impose standards and technical requirements on main hardware and software and may impose registration  licensing and background check requirements on gaming equipment suppliers and their officers  directors and shareholders 
regulatory changes and license status the laws and regulations of the numerous jurisdictions  foreign and domestic  in which wms and our gaming subsidiaries do business are subject to change from time to time 
in addition  the license status of wms and our gaming subsidiaries with respect to these jurisdictions is subject to change 
the information set forth in this report represents the most current available at the time of filing 
seasonality sales of gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the spring and slowest in the summer months 
in addition  quarterly revenues and net income may increase when a coin operated gaming machine or pinball game that achieves significant player appeal is introduced 
employees at august   we employed approximately  persons 
approximately of those employees were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers the ibew  and approximately were represented by the international union of electronic  electrical  salaried machine and furniture workers the iue 
the collective bargaining agreements with the ibew relate to our chicago and waukegan  illinois manufacturing facilities  respectively  and expire on june  the collective bargaining agreement with the iue relates to our cicero  illinois manufacturing facility and expires june  we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
the midway spinoff on april   we distributed to our stockholders through a dividend all of the midway common stock that we owned 
previously  through midway  we designed  published and marketed coin operated and home video games 
on the date of this spinoff  under our stock option plans  the wms stock options held by our directors  officers and other employees were adjusted  and adjustment payments were made to holders of these options 
see item executive compensation 
the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of midway are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the midway spinoff was also accompanied by certain executive officer changes 
prior to the spinoff  in june  louis j 
nicastro had resigned from his positions with wms at the request of our board of directors to devote his full time to the position of chief executive officer of our former subsidiary  whg resorts casinos inc  a puerto rico based hotel  casino and hotel management business whg  in contemplation of the distribution by wms of all the common stock of whg to our stockholders 
in january  whg was merged with a large resort and casino company 
the board of directors  in view of mr 
nicastro s experience with wms and in the industry  invited him to return to wms as chief executive officer and president  effective on the date of the midway spinoff  when our former chief executive officer and president  neil d 
nicastro  resigned from wms in order to devote substantially all of his business time to midway 
in addition  kevin l 
verner became our vice president and chief operating officer shortly after the midway spinoff 
see item executive compensation employment contracts 
in november  the board of directors adopted a rights plan under the rights agreement dated as of march  between us and the bank of new york  as rights agent  which became effective on the date of the midway spinoff 
the rights agreement provides that one preferred stock purchase right will attach to each share of our common stock 
the rights will expire at the close of business on april  unless we previously redeem them for nominal consideration prior to exercisability 
the rights become exercisable after a person or group announces a tender or exchange offer  which  if consummated  would result in that person or group beneficially owning or more of our common stock 
each right  other than rights owned by the person acquiring or more  would then entitle the holder to purchase a number of shares of our common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price 
risk factors some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or that may that adversely affect our operating results are as follows we have experienced losses from continuing operations 
we have experienced operating losses excluding discontinued businesses in two of our last three fiscal years due to a variety of factors  including market acceptance of our products  development costs and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of our new generations of gaming machines and pinball games  adverse litigation rulings that prevented us from selling our older reel spinning slot machine models  and the decline of the pinball industry and related reorganization costs 
although we had operating income in our most recent fiscal year  we cannot assure you that we will sustain profitability 
we depend on introducing new gaming machines that achieve and maintain market acceptance 
our success depends on developing and successfully marketing new gaming machines with strong and sustained player appeal 
a new machine will be accepted by casino operators only if we can show that the machine is likely to produce more revenues to the operator than other machines 
gaming machines are often installed in casinos on a trial basis  and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the casinos 
if a new product does not achieve significant market acceptance  we may not recover our development and promotion costs 
in addition  we must continually adapt our products to emerging technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop products using emerging technologies 
we cannot assure you that the new products that we introduce will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance or that the acceptance will be sustained for any meaningful period 
our growth increasingly depends on recurring revenue lease arrangements  rather than on outright sales of gaming machines 
in october we began to enter into recurring revenue arrangements  which are either participation leases or other short term lease arrangements with casinos for our monopoly themed machines  rather than selling the machines to the casino operators 
approximately million  or  of our gaming revenues for fiscal were derived from these leases  and we expect that lease revenues will constitute an increasing share of our future revenues 
gaming machines under recurring revenue arrangements are replaced by the casinos if they do not meet and sustain revenue expectations 
therefore  these machines are particularly susceptible to pressure from competitors  declining popularity and changes in economic conditions and are at risk of replacement by the casinos  ending the recurring revenues from these machines 
we cannot assure you that our gaming machines will continue to meet the casinos revenue requirements 
in addition  casinos in certain jurisdictions have sought and may continue to seek legislation prohibiting or restricting recurring revenue arrangements 
we cannot assure you that the various gaming jurisdictions will continue to permit recurring revenue arrangements 
the gaming machine market is intensely competitive  and some of our competitors have advantages over us 
the gaming machine business is intensely competitive and is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products 
some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
in addition  new competitors may enter our key markets 
obtaining space and favorable placement on casino gaming floors is a competitive factor in our industry 
competitors with a larger installed base of gaming machines than ours have an advantage in retaining the most space and best placement 
these competitors may also have the advantage of being able to convert their installed machines to newer models in order to maintain their share of casino floor space 
patent infringement claims could limit or affect our ability to market some of our current or new gaming machines 
our competitors have been granted patents covering various gaming machine features 
if our products use processes or other subject matter that is claimed under these existing patents  or if other companies obtain patents claiming subject matter that we use  those companies may bring infringement actions against us 
we might then be forced to discontinue the affected products or be required to obtain licenses from the company holding the patent  if it is willing to give us a license  to develop  manufacture or market our products 
we also might then be limited in our ability to market new products 
we are currently involved in two lawsuits in federal court regarding patent infringement claims concerning products that we no longer manufacture 
see item legal proceedings 
our growth may depend in part upon our ability to obtain licenses to use intellectual properties and licensors approvals of new products on a timely basis 
some of our most popular gaming machines and pinball games are based on trademarks and other intellectual properties licensed from third parties 
our future success may depend upon our ability to obtain licenses for additional popular intellectual properties 
there is competition for these licenses  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring additional intellectual property rights with significant commercial value on acceptable terms 
our intellectual property licenses generally require that we submit new products developed under licenses to the licensor for approval prior to release 
this approval is generally discretionary 
rejection or delay in approval of a product by a licensor could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely on our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain trademark protection for the names or symbols under which we market our products and to obtain copyright and patent protection of our proprietary software and other game innovations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to build and maintain goodwill in our trademarks or obtain trademark or patent protection  that any trademark  copyright or issued patent will provide competitive advantages for us or that our intellectual properties will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information  but we cannot assure you that the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or proprietary information will be honored 
despite various confidentiality agreements and other trade secret protections  our trade secrets and proprietary know how could become known to  or independently developed by  competitors 
our gaming machine business is heavily regulated  and we depend on our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulations and taxes  and the governments of the various gaming jurisdictions amend these regulations from time to time 
virtually all of these jurisdictions require licenses  permits  documentation of qualification  including evidence of financial stability  and other forms of approval for manufacturers and distributors of gaming machines and for their officers  directors  major stockholders and key personnel 
the gaming authorities in some jurisdictions may investigate any individual who has a material relationship with us and any stockholder to determine whether the individual or stockholder is acceptable to those gaming authorities 
each of our gaming machines must be approved in each jurisdiction in which it is placed  and we cannot assure you that a particular game will be approved in any jurisdiction 
licenses  approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
the revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions 
if we fail to seek or do not receive a necessary registration  license  approval or finding of suitability  we may be prohibited from selling our gaming machines for use in the jurisdiction or may be required to sell them through other licensed entities at a reduced profit to us 
some jurisdictions require gaming manufacturers to obtain government approval before engaging in some transactions  such as business combinations 
obtaining licenses and approvals can be time consuming and costly 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all necessary registrations  licenses  permits  approvals or findings of suitability in a timely manner  or at all 
similarly  we cannot assure you that our current registrations  licenses  approvals or findings of suitability will not be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
see government regulation 
the national gambling impact study commission the ngic was created by the us congress in to conduct a comprehensive legal and factual study of the social and economic impacts of gaming on federal  state  local and native american tribal governments and on communities and social institutions 
the ngic issued a report to the president  congress  state governors and tribal leaders containing its findings and conclusions  together with recommendations for legislation and administrative actions in june the ngic report calls for a pause in the growth of legalized gambling and encourages state and local governments to form their own gambling study commissions 
although the ngic has no regulatory or enforcement powers  its recommendations could result in the enactment of new laws and the adoption of new regulations that could adversely impact the gaming industry in general 
the pinball market has contracted and may not grow again 
during fiscal  we completed a downsizing of our pinball design and manufacturing operations in response to the industry wide decline in demand for pinball games over the past few years 
nevertheless  our pinball operations continued to generate an operating loss in fiscal and fiscal pinball games face increased competition from video games and other amusement games for space in their traditional locations  such as arcades and bars  and from home amusement systems 
we cannot assure you that demand in the pinball market will revive or that our pinball business will return to profitability 
in our experience  it has been essential to introduce new technologies and product innovations in order to stimulate demand for pinball games 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop successful new pinball technologies in the future 
in addition  we may not recover our development costs for a new pinball game unless it achieves significant market acceptance 
we cannot assure you that our new pinball games will achieve or sustain consumer acceptance 
we face risks associated with potential business acquisitions 
we may seek to grow through acquiring other companies  intellectual property or other assets 
our success with this strategy will depend on our ability to identify and negotiate attractive investments that will complement or enhance our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to properly identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities  control costs and liabilities incurred with the acquisition of the new businesses or assets  effectively manage growth of operations  or anticipate and evaluate the numerous risks involved in acquiring and operating a new business or asset 
the focus on potential acquisitions could divert our management s resources from other projects 
the acquisition of a costly or unproductive business or asset could materially and adversely affect our business 
we are not currently in discussions with any acquisition candidate 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the performance of senior management and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified game developers 
competition for highly skilled employees with technical  management  marketing  sales  product design and development and other specialized training is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining these employees 
we may also experience increased costs in order to attract and retain skilled employees 
our contract manufacturing business depends on one customer 
we manufacture coin operated video games for midway  which is currently our only contract manufacturing customer 
midway may cancel our contract by giving us six months notice 
midway would then be free to use one or more of our competitors to fulfill its manufacturing needs 
we earned approximately million of operating income from contract manufacturing in fiscal we cannot assure you that midway will continue to employ our services and keep our agreement in effect 
in addition  if midway were to cancel the contract  we would continue to incur the fixed costs of maintaining our waukegan  illinois manufacturing facility 
we may have conflicts of interest with midway 
most of our directors are also directors and stockholders of midway 
in addition  louis j 
nicastro  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  is also a director of midway 
neil d 
nicastro  one of our directors and a consultant to wms  is also the chairman of the board  president  chief executive officer and chief operating officer of midway 
neil d 
nicastro is the son of louis j 
nicastro 
kenneth j 
fedesna  who heads our pinball operations  is also an officer and director of midway 
in addition  harold h 
bach  jr  our chief financial officer and orrin j 
edidin  our general counsel  are also officers of midway 
each of these officers has duties and responsibilities with midway that may conflict with time that might otherwise be devoted to his duties with wms 
these officers must also administer the various contracts and arrangements in effect between midway and wms 
for instance  these officers must decide whether to terminate or permit to continue in force various operating agreements between midway and wms that either party may terminate upon six months notice  including the manufacturing agreement  the cabinet supply agreement and the sales agreement 
see item certain relationships and related transactions 
in addition  these officers may be called upon to negotiate new agreements to be entered into in the future between midway and wms 
we may experience adverse effects as a result of the year computer problem 
many currently installed software programs and embedded programs in electronic systems throughout the world will not work properly when processing dates later than if we experience any year failures  or if any suppliers or customers experience a year problem affecting us  shipments or orders of our affected products might be delayed 
we cannot assure you that we will be free from exposure to legal actions  loss of sales or other unforeseen costs relating to the year problem

sumner redstone owns or controls over of our common stock and may dispose of it at any time 
sumner redstone beneficially owns  shares  or approximately  of our common stock 
mr 
redstone could sell any or all of these shares at any time on the open market or otherwise 
in addition  although mr 
redstone has stated that he has no plans to acquire control of wms  he may sell his stock to a person who wishes to acquire control of wms 
we cannot assure you that any such person will agree with our strategy and business goals described in this report 
the sale by mr 
redstone of a large number of shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
see item certain relationships and related transactions 
our board of directors could use our rights plan and blank check preferred stock to inhibit the acquisition of wms 
rights plan 
under an agreement with the bank of new york  as rights agent  each share of our common stock has an accompanying right to purchase convertible preferred stock that permits each holder to receive shares of our common stock at half price 
the rights become exercisable if any person or entity that did not  before the plan was adopted  own or more of our common stock acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock 
we can redeem the rights at 
per right  subject to certain conditions  at any time 
the rights expire in our board of directors could use this agreement as an anti takeover device to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of wms 
the existence of this agreement could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
blank check preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of five million shares of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences that may be determined from time to time by the board of directors 
accordingly  our board has broad power  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
our board of directors could use preferred stock to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control 
our board has no current plans  agreements or commitments to issue any shares of preferred stock 
the existence of the blank check preferred stock  however  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the substantial number of shares available for sale in the future could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have  authorized shares of common stock  of which  shares were issued and outstanding as of august   excluding  treasury shares 
on that date  we also had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock issuable at an average exercise price of approximately per share 
if all of our issued and outstanding stock options were exercised as of that date  approximately  shares of our common stock would be outstanding 
our board of directors has broad discretion to issue authorized but unissued shares  including discretion to issue shares in compensatory and acquisition transactions 
in addition  if we seek financing through the sale of our securities  our then current stockholders may suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our common stock

item legal proceedings 
in may  we instituted a declaratory judgment action against igt in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois 
the action sought a declaration that a patent issued in and owned by igt the telnaes patent was invalid  and that certain reel spinning slot machines that we were then manufacturing did not infringe the telnaes patent 
igt counterclaimed  alleging that the telnaes patent was infringed by our reel spinning slot machines 
the telnaes patent relates to a particular method of assigning the probability of selecting particular reel stop positions in a computer controlled reel spinning slot machine  which increases or decreases the probabilities of winning by means of the computer s software  not the mechanical reels themselves 
on september   the trial court rendered a decision in favor of igt  finding that the telnaes patent is valid  finding that our model slot machine infringes the telnaes patent  and enjoining us from further infringement of the telnaes patent 
on february   after a hearing on igt s alleged damages  the court awarded a treble damage judgment in favor of igt and against us in the amount of million  plus post judgment interest 
subsequently  the court granted our motion for a stay of proceedings to enforce the money judgment pending disposition of our motion for a new trial and a similar stay pending appeal 
on october   the court denied our motion for a new trial 
we filed a notice of appeal on october  with the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on july   the appeals court reversed the trial court s holding of literal infringement  affirmed its holding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents  vacated its holding of willful infringement  affirmed its holding that the telnaes patent is not invalid and affirmed the award of actual damages of million plus interest  but vacated the award to the extent that it was based on trebling for willful infringement and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings to reconsider the issue of willful infringement in light of the appellate court s finding of no literal infringement 
on august   we filed a petition for rehearing with the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit with respect to the appellate court s affirmance of the trial court s finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents 
since we had previously filed a bond  enforcement of the money judgment has been stayed pending the disposition of the appeal 
on november   igt commenced a second action against us in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois 
in this action  igt seeks a judgment declaring that our model slot machine also infringes the telnaes patent 
the complaint also seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction and treble damages 
on december   the court granted igt s petition for a preliminary injunction and enjoined us from the manufacture  use and sale of the model slot machine 
on may   the court denied our motion to vacate the preliminary injunction 
we filed a notice of appeal on may  in decisions rendered on july  and september   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit a vacated the preliminary injunction and the amount of the security bond set by the trial court and b remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings 
in the event that the court ultimately determines that these slot machines infringe upon the telnaes patent  we would not be able to make  use or sell the model slot machine and we would be required to pay additional damages 
if the appeals ultimately determine that the model or model slot machines infringe the telnaes patent  and we are unable to obtain a license to use that patent  we will be unable to develop certain types of reel spinning slot machines 
the telnaes patent relates only to reel spinning slot machines that we no longer manufacture and does not relate to our video gaming machines or to our currently marketed reel spinning slot machines 
the previously reported litigation with gt interactive software corp 
was settled on august  at no cost to wms 
we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding that we believe could have a material adverse effect on us other than those described above

contract manufacturing 
in fiscal  contract manufacturing revenues of million and operating income of  included operations for the period april  to june  impact of inflation during the past three years  the general level of inflation affecting us has been relatively low 
our ability to pass on future cost increases in the form of higher sales prices will continue to be dependent on the prevailing competitive environment and the acceptance of our products in the marketplace 
year the term year is used to refer to a worldwide computer related problem where some software programs and embedded programs in electronic systems will not work properly when processing a date after we began addressing this problem in we believe that most of the systems utilized for our internal operations have been made year ready  at an estimated cost of million 
the remaining year related work is primarily to upgrade our network servers 
this work is expected to be completed by september   at a cost estimated to be less than  we believe that there are no year issues with respect to the functionality of our products sold in the past or to be sold in the future 
we also believe that our assembly of products will not be affected by malfunctioning tools or equipment using embedded microprocessors  because the assembly process is not heavily reliant on these tools or equipment 
we rely on suppliers of components for our gaming machines and pinball games 
in the event that they experience a year related failure  they may expose us to year problems 
we have contacted certain suppliers and customers to assess their potential year problems 
we cannot determine with certainty our customers or suppliers levels of year readiness 
based on the significant level of responses  however  our suppliers and customers appear to be either year ready or working toward becoming year ready 
we will continue to follow up with those customers and suppliers who have not responded or indicated that their year work is in process 
if needed  to avoid potential year problems detected by our suppliers or customers  we will adjust the shipping dates for products accordingly 
at worst  we would expect a short term delay in shipments 
if a delay should occur  we do not expect it to have a material effect on our operating results for any reportable period 
we do not have a contingency plan for undetected year problems 
we intend to respond to those problems if and when they occur 
we cannot determine the effect on our business  if any  of any undetected year problems 
this discussion of year risks and readiness contains certain forward looking statements concerning future conditions and our business outlook based on currently available information that involve risks and uncertainties 
the actual state of our year readiness and exposure could differ materially from that anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  the ability to obtain supplies and energy  to make deliveries  to communicate with business partners and the year readiness of suppliers  customers and other business partners
