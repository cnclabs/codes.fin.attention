year we do not expect that the cost to modify or replace software that we use  so that our software will properly recognize dates beyond december   will be material 
if we are not successful in implementing any necessary changes to our software  we expect to then develop contingency plans to address any matters not corrected in a timely manner 
we have initiated formal communications with our significant vendors and customers to determine the extent that the needs of those parties to modify their software to properly recognize dates beyond december  may affect us 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of those other companies will be timely converted 
furthermore  there is no assurance that their conversion will be compatible with information included in our systems  without a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
to the extent that responses to such communications with our vendors are unsatisfactory  we expect to take steps to ensure that our vendors have demonstrated that they have made the necessary modifications to their software 
inflation and seasonality inflation has not had any significant adverse effects on our business and we do not believe it will have any significant effect on our future business 
our fragrance business is seasonal  with greater sales during the christmas season than in other seasons 
our other product lines are not seasonal
