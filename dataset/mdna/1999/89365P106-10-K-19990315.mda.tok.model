crouse has achieved ratification of new five year pacts with the international brotherhood of teamsters or other local unions covering substantially all of its union employees 
the new contracts generally provide for all of the terms of the national master freight agreement with a separate addendum for wages 
crouse will continue to maintain its past work rules  practices and flexibility within its operating structure 
crouse continues to negotiate with the union local representing the remaining employees 
there can be  however  no assurance that crouse s remaining union employees will ratify a new contract acceptable to both the company and the union  or that work stoppages will not occur 
if a work stoppage should occur  crouse s customer base would be put at risk inasmuch as its competition would have a continuing operating advantage 
any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
year issues the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits to represent years rather than four digits  which include the century designation 
without corrective action  it is possible that the company s computer programs  or its major service providers  vendors  suppliers  partners or customers that have date sensitive software could recognize a date using as the year rather than the year additionally  certain other assets may contain embedded chips that include date functions that could be affected by the transition to the year in some systems this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has developed and is executing a year compliance strategic plan year plan to enable management of transfinancial and each of its business operations to ensure that each of its critical business systems are year compliant 
the company considers a business system to be year compliant if it is able to transition into the year without significant disruption to the company s internal operations or those of its key business partners 
the year plan encompasses the company s information technology assets  including computer hardware and software it assets and non information technology assets  goods and services  including assets utilizing embedded chip technology and significant customer and vendor relationships non it assets 
the company s year plan includes three principal sections mainframe computer and personal computer hardware and software utilized by the company s transportation operations transportation it assets  desktop computer applications  embedded chips  significant business partners of the transportation operations transportation non it assets  and personal computer hardware and software  desktop computer applications  embedded chips  significant business partners of the financial services operations financial services it and non it assets 
the general phases common to all sections are inventorying  assessing and assigning priorities to year items inventory phase  taking corrective actions to modify  repair or replace items that are determined not to be year compliant corrective action phase  testing material items testing phase  and developing and implementing contingency plans for each organization and location contingency planning phase 
the company intends to utilize primarily internal personnel and resources to execute its year plan but may utilize external consultants as needed in certain phases 
transportation it assets with regard to the transportation it assets section  the inventory phase is completed 
the company has identified its computer applications  programs and hardware and is in the processing of assessing the year risk associated with each item 
the company has begun executing the corrective action phase by modifying or upgrading items that are not year compliant 
this phase is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of the testing phase is ongoing as corrective actions are completed 
the testing phase is anticipated to be complete in the second quarter of the contingency planning phase will begin in the first quarter of and be completed in the third quarter of transportation non it assets with regard to the transportation non it assets section  the inventory phase is completed 
the company has identified assets that may contain embedded chip technologies and has contacted the related vendors to gain assurance of year status on each item 
the company has also identified its significant business relationships and has contacted key vendors  suppliers and customers to attempt to reasonably determine their year status 
the company is in the process of effecting the corrective action phase  which is anticipated to be complete by the end of the first quarter of the testing phase is ongoing as corrective actions are completed 
this phase is anticipated to be complete in the second quarter of the contingency planning phase will begin in the first quarter of and be completed in the third quarter of financial services it and non it assets with regard to the financial services it and non it assets section  the inventory phase is completed 
the company has identified its computer applications  programs and hardware and non it assets and has assessed the year risk associated with each item 
the company has also identified its significant business relationships and has contacted key vendors  suppliers and customers to attempt to reasonably determine their year status 
the company has substantially completed the corrective action phase 
the company s financial services database  operating systems and computer applications have been upgraded or modified to address the year the testing phase has been ongoing as corrections were made and was substantially complete in the fourth quarter of certain testing of bank and other interfaces is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the contingency planning phase will begin in the first quarter of and be completed in the second quarter of costs it is currently estimated that the aggregate cost of the company s year efforts will be approximately  to  of which approximately  has been spent 
these costs are being expensed as they are incurred and are being funded out of operating cash flow 
these amounts do not include approximately  of costs to be capitalized as the company replaces certain non it assets  in part to address the year issue  as part of the company s normal capital replacement and upgrades 
these amounts also do not include any internal costs associated with the development and implementation of contingency plans 
risks the failure to correct a material year issue could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party vendors  suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company s year plan is designed to gather information concerning year issues facing the company and to address and resolve such issues to the extent reasonably possible 
even if the company successfully implements its year plan  there can be no assurance that the company s operations will not be affected by year failures or that such failures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
changes in short term interest rates can affect a the amount of the company s interest expense on its variable interest rate debt and b the amount of the discount on finance accounts receivables sold by upac under its receivable securitization agreement 
the company has not obtained any financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company s long term  variable interest rate debt was  as of december   with  maturing in and the remaining  maturing in in addition  crouse has a variable rate credit facility through which it may borrow million for working capital purposes and million for equipment purposes 
crouse has utilized this line on a limited basis for short term working capital needs  however  no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility as of december  upac sells undivided interests in its insurance premium finance accounts receivables on an ongoing basis under a receivables securitization agreement 
the receivables sold are fixed rate notes and typically have a term of nine months 
an undivided interest in the pool of receivables is sold at a discount rate based on the average rate on day commercial paper over the term of the notes 
consequently  with respect to insurance premium finance receivables sold by upac under the securitization agreement  changes in the rate on day commercial paper during the term of such receivables will affect the amount to be received by upac in the sale of receivables under the securitization agreement 
the company recognizes a gain on sale of receivables that represents the excess of the sale proceeds over the net carrying value of the receivables 
included in the gain recognized are the estimated effects of prepayments  recourse provisions and the discount rate in effect at the time of sale 
as of december   upac had a total finance accounts receivable portfolio of million  including million that had been sold under the securitization agreement 
upac closely monitors interest rates and the extent of its interest rate exposure resulting from its insurance premium finance activities and the sale of insurance premium finance receivables 
upac does not currently use derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  to manage its interest rate risk and does not engage in any other hedging activities 
the estimated impact of a hypothetical basis point one percent change in short term interest rates on the company s interest expense on its variable interest rate debt and on upac s gain on sale of insurance premium finance receivables is approximately  this hypothetical short term interest rate change impact is based on existing business and economic conditions and assumes that upac would pass the increase in interest rates on to its customers in new finance contracts generated after the increase
