gross profit for the year ended december  increased to approximately  or of net sales  compared with approximately  or of net sales in the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in the company s net sales for the gross profit percentage change was due to an increase resulting from the sale of models with higher gross margins more than offset by an increase in warranty expense and two additional factors 
first  the company incurred initial start up production costs related to its model series posi track  primarily during the fourth quarter  as manufacturing changes were made to improve the overall product 
second  the company experienced less retail sales as a percentage of its total net sales in  thereby reducing its overall gross profit margin  as more of its product was sold through its dealer network in compared with for the twelve months ended december   gross profit increased to approximately  or of net sales  compared with approximately  or of net sales  in the increase in gross profit was due to the increase in net sales for the increase in the gross profit percentage was due to several factors

second  the company began selling the posi track dx  which also carried a higher selling price than the average vehicle sold  but also was primarily sold direct to the end user  rather than through the posi track dealer network 
third  greater efficiencies were obtained in the production process as the number of units produced increased significantly in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the twelve months ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately  in to  in as a percentage of net sales  however  these expenses decreased to of net sales in from of net sales in the increase in the expenses is due to increased sales and marketing efforts and increased administrative costs from increased employment levels

in addition  in connection with the exchange by the holders of the company s convertible debentures in the fourth quarter of  the company paid one additional quarter of interest to those who exchanged their debentures for common stock 
this amount represented approximately  of additional interest expense in the increase in was due primarily to a full year of interest expense for the company s  convertible debentures which were issued in october the remaining increase in is due to construction loan interest net of amount capitalized incurred for the expansion of the company s manufacturing facility 
net income 
net income for the twelve months ended december  was approximately  compared with approximately  in and  in the increases were due to increased sales and profitability on those sales  offset  in part  by increased operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s working capital increased to approximately  from approximately  at december  this increase was due primarily to the increase in the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels  offset  in part  by increases in accounts payable and borrowings on the company s line of credit 
the company s sales during the fourth quarter of were approximately  less than the third quarter of  as explained below 
during the fourth quarter  the company chose not to reduce its production levels  but instead  increased its finished goods 
this decision  along with the overall increase in the company s business activity  caused inventory levels to increase from accounts receivable increased as more of the company s sales occurred in december in fourth quarter compared with fourth quarter with the decrease in fourth quarter sales  the company began drawing on its line of credit  with the outstanding advances under the line totaling  at december  with the increase in the company s overall volume  accounts payable increased approximately  or  at december  due to the exercise of certain stock options in the latter half of  the company had no liability for income taxes at december  in addition  the current portion of long term liabilities increased approximately  due to the additional debt incurred for the company s facility expansion and the acquisition of land and buildings for storage and to house the company s research and development activities 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately  compared with approximately  at december  this increase is due to a combination of several factors 
inventory increased approximately  as the company increased production of its original model posi track and introduced two new models in accounts receivable increased approximately  due to increased sales volume 
the company used cash and short term investments of approximately  to finance these increases  along with increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately  the company also funded approximately  of capital expenditures through cash flow generated from operations 
on october   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement the agreement with caterpillar inc caterpillar 
the agreement was approved by the company s shareholders on january  and closed january  under the terms of the agreement  caterpillar acquired  for an aggregate purchase price of  one million newly issued shares of the company s common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional  newly issued shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
also under the terms of the agreement  the company s board of directors was increased from eight to ten with the additional two members appointed as designated by caterpillar 
in connection with entering into the agreement  the company and caterpillar have entered into several ancillary agreements 
these agreements provide the company access to caterpillar s dealer network and also make various management  financial and engineering resources from caterpillar available to the company following the closing 
one of these agreements is a marketing agreement which provides  among other things  that the company will pay caterpillar a commission equal to of the dealer net price for complete machines and for replacement parts and company branded attachments for all sales made to caterpillar dealers 
should the company manufacture products that are eligible to be sold under the caterpillar brand name  the company will pay caterpillar a trademark license fee equal to of the net sales of these products to caterpillar dealers 
following the closing  caterpillar owns approximately of the company s outstanding common stock assuming the exercise of all outstanding stock options and warrants and will have the right to own up to approximately of the company s outstanding common stock assuming the exercise of all outstanding stock options and warrants upon exercise of the warrant 
the company intends to use the proceeds from the initial sale of its shares for increasing production levels  advertising and marketing and general working capital purposes 
it is the intent of the company and caterpillar to introduce the company s posi track products to caterpillar s north american dealers as soon as practicable 
with the signing and announcement of the agreement with caterpillar  certain of the company s existing  non caterpillar dealers have been hesitant to place orders for the company s products 
management believes these dealers are uncertain of their future status as posi track dealers 
between the time of the announcement of the caterpillar transaction and march  approximately dealer locations elected to no longer carry the company s products 
these locations are comprised of eleven dealers who will no longer carry the company s products and two dealers whose posi track trade areas have been reduced 
one of those dealers whose trade area has been reduced was the company s largest customer for this dealer accounted for approximately of the company s net sales in this dealer is a caterpillar dealer and their posi track trade area was reduced as they were selling into the trade area of approximately nine other caterpillar dealers 
the company s believes sales during the fourth quarter of were decreased primarily due to four main factors 
first  during the time the company was negotiating the agreement with caterpillar in the third quarter  the company did not actively market new posi track dealerships to non caterpillar dealers as the company believed these new dealers would not choose to remain dealers when the agreement was announced 
second  the company believes there has been hesitancy on the part of existing posi track dealers to place orders in light of the caterpillar agreement discussed above 
third  because the agreement was entered into during the latter part of the year  the transition to caterpillar dealers began when many caterpillar dealers had already completed their annual purchasing cycles 
finally  the company s largest customer cancelled orders for delivery of approximately million of posi track machines which were scheduled for shipment during the fourth quarter 
the company believes future sales to this posi track dealer also a caterpillar dealer may be reduced as this dealer is the authorized posi track dealer for territory that overlaps nine existing caterpillar dealers trade areas 
the company believes the slow down in orders is temporary and expects the order level to increase as additional caterpillar dealers begin carrying the posi track models 
although the company has been working closely with caterpillar to introduce the posi track products to north american caterpillar dealers as quickly as possible  the company may experience a decrease in its sales volume while the company proceeds through this transitional period with caterpillar 
the company currently believes its first quarter sales will also be reduced for the same reasons mentioned above 
in connection with the replacement of the company s independent dealers with caterpillar dealers  the company has made arrangements with certain dealers to repurchase their existing inventory of posi track products and transfer it to the new caterpillar dealers 
in some instances  it has been necessary for the company to take possession of the inventory  rather than transferring it directly to the new caterpillar dealer 
in these situations  the company will be responsible for re marketing this inventory 
the company does not currently anticipate a material loss from the re marketing of this inventory 
as a result of the transaction  the company s near term revenues  profitability and other financial results are expected to be lower than if the transaction were not announced or entered into 
the decline is related to a number of factors  including i the commission to be paid to caterpillar for sales made through caterpillar s dealers  ii transition issues affecting orders from the preexisting non caterpillar affiliated dealers  and iii certain other costs of implementing the transaction and the agreements contemplated by the commercial alliance agreement 
over the longer term  however  management believes that the company will be able to achieve improved financial results due to the transaction and the commercial alliance agreement 
the company believes its existing cash and marketable securities  together with cash expected to be provided by operations and available  unused credit lines  will satisfy the company s projected working capital needs and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
impact of the year issue 
the company has established a team to assess and address the possible exposures related to the year yk issue and is in the initial assessment phase 
the areas under investigation include business computer systems  production equipment  vendor readiness and contingency plans 
the company does not use internally developed computer software and is therefore not anticipating major reprogramming efforts 
the company s primary financial and operational system has been assessed and is certified yk compliant 
there are several ancillary applications that may not currently be yk compliant  but the company expects it will be able to purchase yy compliant versions by mid to late calendar  the cost of which is not expected to be material 
the majority of the company s personal computers are currently yk compliant 
those computers that may not currently be yk compliant are planned to be replaced as part of the company s technology update strategy 
none of these replacements have been accelerated in response to the yk issue and are not anticipated to have a material effect on the company consolidated financial statements 
equipment used for production or quality control does not use dates to control operations 
the costs of this examination to date have been expensed as incurred and have totaled less than  the company intends to mail questionnaires to each of its significant vendors during the first quarter of to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own yk issues 
it is anticipated this assessment will be completed during second quarter the company anticipates developing a contingency plan once it has completed its assessment of significant vendor compliance which it anticipates to be by the end of second quarter a contingency plan  if needed  will be developed during the second half of to minimize the company s exposure to work slowdowns or business disruptions 
in the event any vendors are not yk compliant  the company may seek new vendors to meet its production needs 
any costs that may be incurred by the company that are related to external systems yk issues are unknown at this time other than immaterial costs of the questionnaire itself 
however  management expects that after reviewing and evaluating the responses to the survey  it will be able to complete an assessment of its yk exposure and estimate the costs associated with resolving any yk issues 
although the company does not at this time expect a significant impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows  the assessment has not been completed and there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a corresponding adverse effect on the company
