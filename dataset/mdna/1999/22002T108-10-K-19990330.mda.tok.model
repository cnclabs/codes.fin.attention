item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview over the last two years  we completed a significant number of acquisitions 
our portfolio consisted of seven retail properties as of december  at that time  we relied on an external advisory agreement for all of our management and administrative needs 
in october  we acquired ten office properties from the shidler group and terminated the external advisory agreement 
during  we acquired office and two retail properties  including office and two retail properties from constellation 
we financed these acquisitions using debt and issuing common shares  preferred shares and ownership interests in corporate office properties  lp  our operating partnership 
to accommodate our growth and changing needs as an organization  we hired management and other staff 
our geographical and product concentration also changed substantially as a result of these acquisitions 
in  we derived all of our rental revenue from our retail properties in the midwest region of the united states 
in  we derived of our rental revenue from our properties in the mid atlantic region of the united states  most of which are office properties 
as of december   our portfolio included commercial real estate properties leased for office and retail purposes 
due to these significant changes  our results of operations changed dramatically 
we conduct almost all of our operations through our operating partnership  of which we are the managing general partner 
the operating partnership owns real estate both directly and through subsidiaries 
the operating partnership also owns the principal economic interest and  collectively with our chief executive officer and chief operating officer  of the voting common stock of corporate office management  inc comi 
we refer to comi and its subsidiaries as the service companies 
interests in our operating partnership are in the form of common and preferred units 
as of december   we owned approximately of the outstanding common units and approximately of the outstanding preferred units 
the remaining common and preferred units in our operating partnership were owned by third parties  which included certain of our officers and trustees 
if all preferred units were converted into common units  we would have owned approximately of the common units as of december  in  we increased our ownership of the operating partnership substantially by contributing proceeds from our common share offering on april  and assets acquired from constellation into the operating partnership in exchange for common and preferred units 
in this section  we discuss our financial condition and results of operations for and this section includes discussions on o why various components of our consolidated statements of operations changed from to and from to  o what our primary sources and uses of cash were in  o how we raised cash for acquisitions and other capital expenditures during o how we intend to generate cash for future capital expenditures  and o the computation of our funds from operations for  and it may be helpful as you read this section to refer to our consolidated financial statements and selected financial data table

results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and our total revenues increased million or from of this increase  million was generated by rental income and million by tenant recoveries and other income 
tenant recovery income includes payments from tenants as reimbursement for property taxes  insurance and other property operating expenses 
our growth in revenues was due mostly to our property acquisitions in and the impact of a full year of operations for the properties we acquired from the shidler group in october our property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization increased million or from due mostly to our property acquisitions 
our interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs increased million or from because of our borrowings and assumptions of debt needed to finance property acquisitions 
our general and administrative expenses increased million or from of this increase   are costs we expensed in exploring possible property acquisitions that did not occur 
the remaining increase is due mostly to our property acquisitions and our conversion from an externally advised reit to a full service reit 
during and through september  we functioned operationally as an externally advised reit 
when we completed the property acquisitions from the shidler group in october  we hired management and other staff so that we could operate as a full service reit 
in september  we entered into a management relationship with comi in connection with our acquisition of properties from constellation 
as a result of this relationship  we added management and other staffing functions to further expand our capabilities and support our growing portfolio of properties 
our total expenses increased million or from due mostly to the effects of the increases in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization  interest expense and amortization of deferred finance costs and general and administrative expenses described above 
in addition to these items  our expenses included  in costs associated with our reformation into a maryland reit in march our expenses included million in costs to terminate an advisory agreement in connection with our conversion from an externally advised reit to a full service reit 
our income before minority interests also includes our equity in income from the service companies  which were established in these service companies are not included as consolidated subsidiaries in our financial statements 
as a result of the above factors  our income before minority interests increased by million from our income allocation to minority interests increased million or from the amounts reported for minority interests on our consolidated statements of operations represent the portion of the operating partnership s net income not allocated to us 
minority interests resulted from our creation of the operating partnership in october the percentage of income allocated to minority interests decreased during as our percentage ownership of the operating partnership increased 
the increase in income allocated to minority interests in from is due to the effects of the minority interests being in place for the entire year  offset by the decreased percentage of income allocated to minority interests later in the year 
our income available to common shareholders increased million from due to the factors discussed above partially offset by  in dividends declared on our series a convertible preferred shares of beneficial interest preferred shares issued in our diluted earnings per common share increased per share from due to the effect of the increase in net income being proportionately greater than the effects of the issuance of our common shares and preferred and common units in the operating partnership in october  our share offering in april  the issuance of our common shares in connection with the constellation transaction and the issuance of common units in our operating partnership in october comparison of the years ended december  and our total revenues increased million or from of this increase  million was generated by rental income and  by tenant recoveries and other income

in addition to these items  our expenses included million in costs to terminate the advisory agreement 
as a result of the above factors  we incurred a  loss before minority interests in we incurred a  net loss available to common shareholders in due to the factors discussed above and the allocation of income to minority interests resulting from our creation of the operating partnership in october we incurred a diluted loss per common share in due to the factors discussed above and the issuance of our common shares and preferred units and common units in the operating partnership in october liquidity and capital resources capitalization historically  cash provided from operations represented our primary source of liquidity to fund distributions  pay debt service and fund working capital requirements 
we expect to continue to meet our short term capital needs from property cash flow  including all property expenses  general and administrative expenses  dividend and distribution requirements and recurring capital improvements and leasing commissions 
we do not anticipate borrowing to meet these requirements 
on april   we completed the sale of  common shares to the public at a price of per share 
in connection with the share offering  our common shares were listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol ofc 
our net proceeds from the share offering totaled million 
we used the net proceeds to acquire  common units in our operating partnership 
on may   we obtained a million recourse revolving credit facility from bankers trust company 
we used proceeds from the revolving credit facility throughout to fund property acquisitions 
this loan bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus and provides for monthly payments of interest only 
the loan also requires that we pay a quarterly fee of per annum on the difference between million and the outstanding balance 
this loan matures on may  and may be extended one year 
we have mortgaged of our properties as collateral for this loan 
this loan and our term credit facility with bankers trust company are cross defaulted  which means that a default on the terms of one of the loans triggers a default of the other loan

tiaa advanced million of this loan on october  and million on december  the proceeds from this loan were used mostly to repay certain debt assumed in our property acquisitions and a portion of the revolving credit facility 
this loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and provides for monthly payments of principal and interest of  this loan matures on november  and may not be prepaid prior to november  we have mortgaged nine of our properties as collateral for this loan 
during  we acquired operating properties and three land parcels for an aggregate acquisition cost of million 
of the operating properties acquired  are located in the baltimore washington corridor and ten in new jersey 
the land parcels are located in the baltimore washington corridor 
the operating property acquisitions increased our rentable square footage by approximately million 
we also acquired a interest in a real estate management services entity and certain equipment  furniture  and other assets related to constellation real estate  inc for million 
these acquisitions were financed by o assuming million in mortgage loans  o issuing  of our common shares  valued at million per share  less  in share issuance costs  o issuing  of our preferred shares  valued at million per share  o issuing  common units in our operating partnership  valued at million per share  and o using million in cash 
our april share offering  the revolving credit facility and the loan from tiaa provided the cash used for our acquisitions 
during  we began construction of new buildings on two of the land parcels we acquired that are estimated upon completion to total  square feet 
we also began a project that is expected to expand the rentable square footage of one of our properties by  square feet 
on january   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bankers trust company 
this swap agreement fixes our one month libor base to per annum on a notional amount of million through may on january   we entered into a million construction loan with fmb bank to finance the construction of a building 
this loan has an interest rate of libor plus 
this loan matures on february  and may be extended for a one year period  subject to certain conditions 
on january   we sold a retail property located in westminster  maryland 
we sold the property for million  of which million was used to pay off the mortgage loan payable on the property   was placed in escrow   was paid to the buyer for operating pro rations   was used to pay our closing costs and million was used to pay down our revolving credit facility 
we recognized no gain or loss on the sale

this loan matures on february  and may be extended for a one year period  subject to certain conditions 
on february   we acquired a  square foot office building located in linthicum  maryland 
we acquired the property for million  including  in transaction costs  using million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and using cash reserves for the balance 
we have no contractual obligations for property acquisitions or material capital costs  other than completing the two development projects mentioned above and tenant improvements in the ordinary course of business 
we expect to meet our long term capital needs through a combination of cash from operations  additional borrowings and additional equity issuances of common shares  preferred shares  common units and or preferred units 
we are under contract to sell three of our retail properties 
the contracted sale price for these properties is million 
statement of cash flows we generated net cash flow from operations of million in  an increase of million from our increase in cash flows from operations is due mostly to income generated from our newly acquired properties 
our net cash flow used in investing activities increased million from due mostly to the larger volume of property acquisitions 
our net cash flow provided by financing activities increased million from due mostly to borrowings obtained or assumed to finance property acquisitions and proceeds from the april stock offering 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations ffo to be meaningful to investors as a measure of the financial performance of an equity reit when considered with the financial data presented under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  ffo means net income loss computed using generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
further  if the conversion of securities into common shares is dilutive  we exclude any gaap income allocated to these securities in computing ffo 
the ffo we present may not be comparable to the ffo of other reits since they may interpret the current nareit definition of ffo differently or they may not use the current nareit definition of ffo 
ffo is not the same as cash generated from operating activities or net income determined in accordance with gaap 
ffo is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs 
additionally  it should not be used as an alternative to net income when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating  investing and financing when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service 
our ffo for  and are summarized in the following table 
for the year ended december  dollars and shares in thousands income loss before minority interests  add nonrecurring charges reformation costs advisory agreement termination cost  add real estate related depreciation and amortization   less preferred unit distributions  less preferred share dividends funds from operations   add preferred unit distributions  add preferred share dividends funds from operations diluted   less straight line rent adjustments  less recurring capital improvements adjusted funds from operations diluted   weighted average common shares    conversion of common units  weighted average common shares units basic 
   assumed conversion of share options conversion of preferred shares conversion of preferred units   weighted average common shares units diluted    inflation we have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the periods presented in this report 
this is mostly because of the relatively low inflation rates in our markets 
most of our tenants are contractually obligated to pay their share of operating expenses  thereby reducing exposure to increases in such costs resulting from inflation 
impact of the year issue many older computer software programs refer to years in terms of their final two digits only 
such programs may interpret the year to mean the year instead 
if not corrected  this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including a temporary inability to process transactions  prepare financial statements  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activity 
our accounting software package was certified as year compliant by its manufacturer 
accordingly  we do not anticipate problems in processing the billing and collection of revenue  the payment of expenditures  the recording of financial transactions  the preparation of financial statements and maintaining and generating system driven managerial information 
our information technology and accounting groups are conducting internal tests to ensure compliance 
this testing process is estimated to be completed by the second quarter of our accounting department has developed a plan that will enable a certain amount of manual processing to take place in the unlikely event that problems arise with our accounting software 
our property management team has been continually evaluating the impact of the year issue on the various facets of property operating systems since the beginning of this evaluation process will continue through the second quarter of based on the current status of this evaluation process  we do not anticipate any material adverse consequences on property operations 
our property management team has alternative plans in place to address unexpected problems that may arise with the property operating systems 
additional property management staff will also be on call to respond to any such problems on january we rely on third party suppliers for a number of key services 
interruption of supplier operations due to the year issue could affect our operations 
we also are dependent upon our tenants for revenue and cash flow 
interruptions in tenant operations due to the year issue could result in reduced revenue  increased receivable levels and cash flow reductions 
our property management team is in the process of contacting significant tenants and suppliers to discuss year readiness 
management is being continually updated on the status of this process  which is estimated to be completed by the second quarter of based on information currently available from our internal assessment  management does not expect significant incremental costs associated with our year activities during we will also evaluate year issues for all future property acquisitions and development 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached consensus on emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for internal costs relating to real estate property acquisitions eitf 
eitf  effective march   requires that internal costs of pre acquisition activities incurred in connection with the acquisition of an operating property should be expensed as incurred 
we do not incur significant internal costs from pre acquisition activities  therefore the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our consolidated statements of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for financial statements for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  we plan to adopt this standard beginning january  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value  unless certain conditions are met that allow the entity to designate certain derivatives as a hedge 
we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  the most predominant of which is changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates can result in increased interest expense under our revolving credit facility and our other mortgage loans payable carrying variable interest rate terms 
increases in interest rates can also result in increased interest expense when our mortgage loans payable carrying fixed interest rate terms mature and need to be refinanced 
based on our variable rate debt balances during the year ended december   our interest expense would have increased  if interest rates were higher 
on january   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bankers trust company that fixes our one month libor base to per annum on a notional amount of million through may while this swap agreement reduces the impact of an increase in interest rates  the nonperformance of bankers trust company in this swap agreement  while remote  could result in material losses 
we expect to continue to use such swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate changes
