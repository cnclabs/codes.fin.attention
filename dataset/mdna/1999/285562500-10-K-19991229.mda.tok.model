net income for the fiscal year rose to  a increase over net income of  in fiscal year total revenues for the fiscal year were  a increase over revenues of  for fiscal year the primary revenue increase was from bankcard processing and transaction processing  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
revenues derived from the electronic processing of transactions are recognized at the time the transactions are processed by the merchant 
the principal contributors to the increase in bankcard processing revenue and transaction revenue are the increased revenue from the magic acquisition and the incremental effect of the pass through of higher interchange rates from the credit card associations  which was effective april additionally  transaction revenue from u haul also increased by from the prior year 
as of september  the company processed for over  active retail merchant accounts and equipment rental dealers located around the country 
in july  u haul international awarded the company a bid for credit card processing service for its independent dealers who participate in the preferred dealer program 
the company is also authorized to promote its credit card processing service to the  dealers who are currently using the company s terminals for its daily inventory tracking and credit card authorization activities 
the company is now in the process of enhancing the software in the terminals to include credit card processing for the dealer s non u haul activities 
this will reduce the amount of equipment the dealer must have on his counter and simplify the dealer s day to day operations 
however  there is no assurance that these independent dealers will sign up with the company s credit card processing program 
revenue related to terminal sales is recognized when the equipment is shipped 
terminal sales and lease revenue increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
this increase was primarily due to more terminals sold in fiscal as a result of several new sales programs 
this increase was partially offset by  u haul systems shipped in fiscal versus  systems shipped in fiscal other revenue which consist mainly of research and development revenue increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
this increase was attributable to software development work for innoventry  a casino cash advance provider  and the united states postal service usps

until this evaluation is complete  all further development is on hold 
it was emphasized to the company that the delay of active development under the pilot program should not imply that a decision has been made on the merits of the pilot program but that other issues are requiring the full resources of the usps at this time 
no commitment or indication was given regarding when the usps would complete its evaluations and dedicate resources to the pilot program but it was evident  in management s opinion  that the usps is still very interested in the company s system that serves the small volume usps offices 
costs and expenses 
bankcard processing expenses have generally remained constant as a percentage of processing revenue 
most of the company s bankcard processing expenses are fixed as a percentage of each transaction amount  with the remaining costs being based on a fixed rate applied to the transactions processed 
processing related expenses  consisting of bankcard processing expense  transaction expense and customer service expense  increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
this was directly attributable to the increase in bankcard processing and transaction revenue in fiscal year the cost of terminals sold and leased decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a decrease 
this was the result of higher gross margin from equipment sales due to lower pricing from equipment vendors 
additionally  no inventory allowance was recorded in fiscal year other operating costs increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal year  a increase 
this increase was the research and development expenses on the cash advance project and the development costs of the check products and services for fiscal year selling  and general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal year this was primarily attributable to the expansion of the company s sales and marketing program and the inclusion of magic s operations started in april furthermore  the increase was due to the higher employee related costs to support the growth of the company

however  the company may need to raise additional funds in order to support expansion or develop new business units that is strategic to the company s growth 
thee can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
in november  the company completed a million post petition secured financing arrangement with tropical beaches  inc dba new strategies  a bankcard processing merchant who filed for chapter protection on june  according to the terms of the loan agreement  new strategies will begin repayment in december  and will retire the loan in full on or before february together with interest

the company also relies  directly and indirectly  on the external systems of various independent business enterprises  such as its customers  sponsoring banks  suppliers  creditors  financial organizations  and of governments for the accurate exchange of data and related information 
all programs  including merchant systems  have been modified and successfully tested 
additionally  interface requirements and testing have been successfully completed with visa  mastercard  discover and american express 
key management has been reassigned to implement the plan and  other than the cost of such management and the resultant loss of their contribution to other revenue generating activities of the company  substantial new costs are not anticipated to be incurred 
therefore  management s current estimate is that the costs associated with the year issue were approximately  and are not believed to have a material adverse affect on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
these costs were included in the operating expenses in fiscal year however  despite management s plan to address the year impact on the company s internal systems  no assurance can be given that management has fully identified such impact or that management can resolve it without disruption of the business and without incurring significant expenses 
in addition  even if the internal systems of the company are not materially affected by the year issue  the company could be affected adversely as a result of any disruption in the operation of the various third party enterprises with which the company interacts

this is indicative of the revenue growth in fiscal combined with an improvement in gross margin in bankcard processing and transaction revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement in gross margin was mainly due to the implementation of certain industry specific fees in fiscal which had virtually no impact on direct costs 
total revenues increased by  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the increase reflected revenue growth of in bankcard processing and transaction revenue which is partially offset by a decrease in terminal sales and lease revenue from prior fiscal year 
the increase in processing and transaction revenue is attributable to three areas the increase in processing volume from the company s growing merchant base along with the overall rate increases for the entire merchant base as a result of the interchange rate increases implemented by visa and mastercard in april  the increase in inventory transaction volume with u haul international  and the implementation of certain industry specific fees in the current fiscal year
