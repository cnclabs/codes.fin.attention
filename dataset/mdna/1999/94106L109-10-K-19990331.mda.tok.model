however  these increases are partially offset by the divestiture of certain solid waste operations  as well as the impact of the currency translation fluctuations of the canadian dollar 
acquisitions of solid waste businesses in north america during and the full year effect of such acquisitions completed during accounted for an increase in operating revenues of approximately  internal growth for comparable north american collection  transfer  landfill and recycling services was  which was comprised of for pricing increases and for volume increases 
for the year ended december   the nasw operating revenues were negatively impacted by the lower prices received for recyclable materials  which can fluctuate substantially from period to period 
had the pricing for recyclable materials remained constant during  internal growth for comparable nasw operations would have been for the period

the mix of operating revenues during reflects an increase in collection operating revenues as a percentage of total nasw operating revenues 
this change in revenue mix is primarily due to the acquisition of large collection operations during  including the march acquisition of the canadian solid waste operations of allied waste services  inc the operating revenues from wm international decreased approximately  or and  or during and as compared to the respective prior year 
this decrease in is primarily due to the sale of certain assets  such as the waste to energy facility in hamm  germany in january  as well as the expiration of the buenos aires  argentina contract in february in internal growth from wm international reflected a modest decline

additionally  wm international s operating revenues were negatively impacted in by approximately  due to foreign currency translation fluctuations 
operating revenues for the company s non solid waste operations were substantially consistent for the three years ended december  however  the company expects that operating revenues from its non solid waste operations will decrease in future periods as the company is actively marketing certain of these businesses

after consideration of these items  the company s general and administrative expense declined as a percentage of operating revenues from to as a result of the company s ability to integrate acquisitions and mergers of solid waste businesses without a proportionate increase in costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  or in and  or in  as compared to the respective prior year 
as a percentage of operating revenues  depreciation and amortization expense was in  in  and increased to in effective october   wm holdings discontinued assigning salvage values to collection vehicles and containers  and adopted a process that shortened the estimated useful lives of certain landfills 
this change in estimate by the management of wm holdings  which continued throughout and is substantially consistent with the estimates historically utilized by the company  increased depreciation and amortization expense by  in the fourth quarter of also contributing to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the three year period ended december  is the effect of acquisitions of solid waste businesses  increased landfill volumes  and an increased utilization of internal disposal capacity 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in was in part offset by the discontinuance of depreciation and amortization during the second six months of for non revenue producing assets held for sale or abandoned in connection with the wm holdings merger and the effect of dispositions of waste management assets

the company s business strategy is to continue to grow through acquisitions 
consequently  future quarterly results could be impacted by additional merger costs and related expenses associated with such merger and acquisition activity 
liquidity and capital resources the company operates in an industry that requires a high level of capital investment 
the company s capital requirements primarily stem from i its working capital needs for its ongoing operations  ii capital expenditures for cell construction and expansion of its disposal sites  as well as new trucks and equipment for its collection operations  and iii business acquisitions 
the company s strategy is to meet these capital needs first from internally generated funds and secondly from various financing sources available to the company  including the incurrence of debt and the issuance of its common stock 
it is further part of the company s strategy to minimize working capital while maintaining available commitments under bank credit agreements to fund any capital needs in excess of internally generated cash flow 
the company had unused and available credit capacity under its domestic bank facilities of  at december   and  as of march  as of december   the company had a working capital deficit of  a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of and a cash balance of  which compares to a working capital deficit of  a current ratio of and a cash balance of  as of december  the working capital at december   was impacted by current assets held for sale of  and an increase in current deferred income tax assets of  as compared to the prior year balance

if the company s cash flow from operations during is less than currently expected  or if the company s capital requirements increase  either due to strategic decisions or otherwise  the company may elect to incur future indebtedness or issue equity securities to cover any additional capital needs 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining additional capital on acceptable terms through such debt incurrances or issuances of additional equity securities 
acquisition activity in on july   the company completed a merger with wm holdings 
under the terms of the wm holdings merger  the company issued of a share of its common stock for each outstanding share of wm holdings common stock 
the wm holdings merger increased the company s outstanding shares of common stock by approximately  shares  and the company assumed wm holdings stock options equivalent to approximately  underlying shares of the company s common stock 
any unvested wm holdings options issued prior to march  vested upon consummation of the wm holdings merger due to change of control provisions in the related plans 
wm holdings was previously the largest publicly traded solid waste company in the us  providing integrated solid waste management and hazardous waste management services in north america and comprehensive waste management and related services  including solid and hazardous waste management services  internationally 
wm holdings was also a leading developer of facilities for  and provider of services to  the waste to energy and waste fuel powered independent power markets 
on december   the company consummated the eastern merger pursuant to which the company issued approximately  shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of eastern 
on november   the company acquired the interest of the united kingdom operations that were previously owned by wessex water plc for approximately  on november   the company completed the acquisition of the publicly owned shares of wmi plc 
pursuant to the acquisition  holders of the approximately million ordinary shares not already owned by the company including those represented by american depositary receipts received approximately for each share held  for a total of approximately  the company liquidated wmi plc after the acquisition in an effort to simplify the corporate structure and provide enhanced tax planning opportunities 
the company s international operations are now conducted through wm international 
on june   the company acquired the solid waste businesses of american waste for approximately  in cash 
the businesses acquired include three landfills and one collection operation located in ohio 
on may   the company consummated a merger with transamerican pursuant to which the company issued approximately  shares of its common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of transamerican 
the businesses acquired include five collection operations  nine landfills and two transfer stations located throughout the southern us on march   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of wti which it did not already own for  in cash 
on january   the company acquired the solid waste divisions of city management for approximately  consisting of cash and debt assumed 
the businesses acquired are primarily located in the state of michigan and include several collection operations  landfills  and transfer stations 
in addition to the aforementioned acquisition transactions  the company paid an aggregate of  in cash  common stock  and liabilities assumed to acquire solid waste assets and businesses 
environmental matters the company has material financial commitments for the costs associated with its future obligations for final closure  which is the closure of the final cell of a landfill  and post closure of landfills it operates or for which it is otherwise responsible 
the final closure and post closure liabilities are accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the total estimated final closure and post closure cost will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time the site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
the company has also established procedures to evaluate its potential remedial liabilities at closed sites which it owns or operated  or to which it transported waste  including sites listed on the npl 
the majority of situations involving npl sites relate to allegations that subsidiaries of the company or their predecessors transported waste to the facilities in question  often prior to the acquisition of such subsidiaries by the company 
in instances in which the company has concluded that it is probable that a liability has been incurred  provision has been made in the financial statements 
estimates of the extent of the company s degree of responsibility for remediation of a particular site and the method and ultimate cost of remediation require a number of assumptions and are inherently difficult  and the ultimate outcome may differ from current estimates 
however  the company believes that its extensive experience in the environmental services business  as well as its involvement with a large number of sites  provides a reasonable basis for estimating its aggregate liability 
as additional information becomes available  estimates are adjusted as necessary 
while the company does not anticipate that any such adjustment would be material to its financial statements  it is reasonably possible that technological  regulatory or enforcement developments  the results of environmental studies  the existence and ability of other potentially responsible third parties to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities  or other factors could necessitate the recording of additional liabilities which could be material 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  the company has estimated that the aggregate cost of environmental liabilities for all sites owned or operated as of december   will be approximately  as of december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of  and  respectively  for final closure and post closure costs of disposal facilities 
the difference between the final closure and post closure costs accrued at december   and the total estimated final closure and post closure costs to be incurred will be accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the total estimated final closure and post closure costs to be incurred will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time the site discontinues accepting waste and is closed 
as of december   the company also expects to incur approximately  related to future construction activities during the remaining operating lives of the disposal sites  which are also being expensed over the useful lives of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed 
seasonality and inflation the company s operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months 
this is generally reflected in the company s first quarter and fourth quarter operating results 
this is primarily attributable to the fact that i the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities tends to increase in the spring and summer months and ii the volume of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where the company operates tends to decrease during the winter months 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected to have  any material adverse effect on the results of operations in the near future 
year date conversion the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive data by the company s computerized information systems 
in  the company began to modify its north american computer information systems to ensure proper processing of transactions relating to the year and beyond and completed the majority of the required modifications to its critical business systems in use in north america during the company expects to have all of such modifications completed during the third quarter of for wm international  systems supplied by an outside vendor are used for critical operations 
that vendor has supplied the company with year compliant versions  deployment of which is largely completed 
the company expects that the systems used by wm international will be fully year compliant during the third quarter of the amount charged to expense during and  as well as the amounts expected to be charged to expense in  related to the year computer compliance modifications  have not been material and are not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition to its critical business systems  the company has addressed the issue of the year impact on certain of its embedded technologies 
incinerators and monitoring wells both have computer chips embedded within them  and the company has undertaken to upgrade those chips to avoid any malfunctioning of the chips as a result of the year the company expects such upgrades to be complete by the end of the company is also taking steps to resolve year compliance issues that may be created by customers  suppliers and financial institutions with whom the company does business 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other entities will be converted timely 
the company is in the process of establishing a worst case scenario and written contingency plan to address any issues that could arise should the company or any of its suppliers or customers not be prepared to accommodate year issues timely 
the company believes that in an emergency it could revert to the use of manual systems that do not rely on computers and could perform the minimum functions required to provide information reporting to maintain satisfactory control of the business 
should the company have to utilize manual systems  it is uncertain that it could maintain the same level of operations  and this could have a material adverse impact on the business 
the company intends to maintain constant surveillance on this situation and will develop such contingency plans as are required by the changing environment

activities related to mergers or acquisitions are not considered start up activities  and therefore sop does not change the accounting for such items 
the company adopted sop in the third quarter of the impact of sop was not material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
effective january   the company adopted the american institute of certified public accountants statements of position  environmental remediation liabilities sop 
sop provides that environmental remediation liabilities should be accrued when the criteria of the fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  are met 
sop also provides that the accrual for such liabilities should include future costs for those employees expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to the management of remediation liabilities 
the adoption of sop during resulted in an increase to operating costs and expenses of approximately  for that period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices and certain equity prices 
from time to time  the company and certain of its subsidiaries use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
the derivatives used are simple agreements which provide for payments based on the notional amount  with no multipliers or leverage 
all derivatives are related to actual or anticipated exposures of transactions of the company 
while the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and the company does not anticipate non performance 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company monitors its derivative positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses 
the company has performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of the company s market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from the company s assumptions 
the effects of such market movements may also directly or indirectly affect the company s assumptions 
the effects of such market movements may also directly or indirectly affect company rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect on the company from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate exposure 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s debt obligations  which are mainly denominated in us dollars 
in addition  interest rate swaps are generally used to lock in or limit the variability in the interest expense of certain floating rate debt obligations 
an instantaneous  one percentage point decline in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of the company s combined debt and interest rate swap position at december  and by approximately  and  respectively 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items such as pension liabilities  nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
as a significant portion of the company s debt is at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless such debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
currency rate exposure 
from time to time  the company and certain of its subsidiaries have used foreign currency derivatives to seek to mitigate the impact of translation on foreign earnings and income from foreign investees 
typically these derivatives have taken the form of purchased put options or collars 
there were no currency derivatives outstanding at december  and  that relate to hedging the translation of foreign earnings 
the company occasionally incurs currency risk from cross border transactions 
when such transactions are anticipated or committed to  the company may enter into forward contracts or purchase options to reduce or eliminate the related foreign exchange risk 
the company also incurs exchange rate risk from borrowings denominated in foreign currencies 
an instantaneous  ten percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates would affect the fair value of the company s foreign currency borrowings and foreign exchange hedges at december  and  by approximately  and  respectively 
the total effect on the company from movements in exchange rates will also be influenced by other factors 
for example  an increase in the fair value of foreign currency denominated debt caused by exchange rate movements may be more than offset by an increase in the value of the company s net investment in foreign countries 
commodities price exposure 
the company operates a large fleet of vehicles that require the purchase of a significant amount of fuel 
in the past  the company has used crude oil collars and swaps as a proxy to seek to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in fuel prices 
the company s fuel collars consisted of a call option or cap and a corresponding put option at a lower price or floor 
the cap limits the company s potential increased operating cost from higher fuel prices whereas the floor limits the company s potential cost savings from a decline in fuel prices 
under its fuel swap agreements  the company collected payments from the swap counterparty when fuel prices averaged above a certain reference price 
when prices averaged below said reference prices  the company made payments to the counterparty 
all of the company s fuel hedges were cash settled 
quantities hedged do not exceed committed fuel purchases or anticipated usage in any period 
an instantaneous  ten percent decrease in the applicable reference price for hedges in place at december   would cause a fair value loss to the company of approximately  the company no longer uses such commodities and held no fuel collars at december  equity price exposure 
the company occasionally obtains stock that it holds for a certain period of time 
the company sometimes seeks to mitigate its market exposure to such holdings by entering into equity collars 
such a collar consists of a cap that limits the company s potential for gain from appreciation in the stock price as well as a floor that limits the company s loss potential from a decline in the stock price 
an instantaneous  ten percent decline in the price of the shares held by the company at december   would decrease the combined fair value of the stock and collar positions by approximately  the company had no such equity positions at december the company is also further subject to equity price exposure from company debt issues that are convertible into the company s common stock 
these debt issues had an aggregate carrying value of  and  as of december and  respectively 
an instantaneous  ten percent increase in the company s stock price on december  and  would increase the fair value of the company s convertible debt by approximately  and  respectively 
however  such changes in stock prices would not impact net income
