item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the company is a vertically integrated steel processor that supplies blanks  stampings and processed steel as well as designs and builds tools and dies for the automotive and other industries 
the company currently provides a broad range of intermediate steel processing services  which include i blanking and stamping  and ii other steel processing services which include pickling hot rolled steel  slitting  edge trimming  roller leveling and cutting to length of both hot and cold rolled steel 
the company operates through ten subsidiaries  shiloh corporation  valley city steel company  the sectional die company  medina blanking  inc  sectional stamping  inc  liverpool coil processing  inc  shiloh of michigan  the company s joint venture with rouge  greenfield die manufacturing company  c h design company and jefferson blanking  inc 
in  the company prepared a long term  business plan which included a strategic decision to concentrate on the core steel processing services 
as a result  the company sought inquiries from prospective bidders for the sale of its subsidiary  shafer valve company shafer valve 
effective april   the company accounted for shafer valve as a discontinued operation 
in may  the company entered into an agreement to sell the stock of shafer valve to bettis corporation 
the sale was completed on july  the company typically experiences decreased revenue and operating income during the first fiscal quarter of each year  usually resulting from slower overall automobile production during the winter months 
the revenues and operating income in the third fiscal quarter can also be affected by the typically lower automobile production activities in july due to manufacturers changeover in production lines 
in analyzing the financial aspects of the company s steel processing operations  a number of factors must be considered 
first  plant utilization levels are very important to profitability because of the capital intensive nature of these operations 
because the company performs a number of different processing operations  however  it is not meaningful to analyze simply the total tons of steel processed 
for example  blanking and stamping involve more operational processes  from the design and manufacture of tools and dies to the production and packaging of the final product  than the company s other steel processing services and therefore generally have higher margins 
second  a significant portion of the company s steel processing products and services is provided to customers on a toll processing basis 
under these arrangements  the company charges a specified toll processing fee for the processing operations performed without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss 
although the proportion of tons processed by the company that are directly owned and toll processed may fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily based on the customers for which the company is providing services during such period  the company estimates that during the past three years approximately  and  respectively  of total tons processed was done on a toll processing basis 
revenues from operations involving directly owned steel include a component of raw material cost whereas toll processing revenues do not  consequently  toll processing generally results in lower gross profit  but higher gross margin  than directly owned steel processing 
therefore  an increase in the proportion of total revenues attributable to directly owned steel processing may result in higher revenues and gross profits but lower gross margins 
the company s blanking and stamping operations use more directly owned steel than do its other steel processing operations 
in addition  changes in the price of steel can impact the company s results of operations because raw material costs are by far the largest component of cost of sales in processing directly owned steel 
in november  the company entered into a joint venture with bing and rouge  but in order to more closely focus on its core business the company terminated its interest in the joint venture on march  by mutual agreement

year ended october  compared to year ended october  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the comparable period in the increase in revenues is primarily due to the inclusion in fiscal of million in revenues from c h and increased revenues resulting from additional steel processing capabilities at sectional stamping 
in addition  revenues increased at shiloh of michigan and liverpool coil processing 
revenues from the blanking and stamping operations for fiscal increased approximately from the comparable period due primarily to the inclusion of c h and increased revenue at sectional stamping  while revenue from the other steel processing operations for fiscal increased approximately from the comparable period in fiscal due primarily to increased revenue at shiloh of michigan and liverpool coil processing 
the percentage of revenues from directly owned steel processed was for fiscal compared to for fiscal revenues from the toll processed steel were for fiscal and for the comparable period in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable period in gross margin decreased to in fiscal from for the comparable period in the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to lower margins in the tool and die business  a decrease in outsourcing by major steel producing customers that impacted one of our steel processing operations  a lower price for scrap steel that is sold in the secondary steel industry  the residual effects from the gm strike and greenfield s continued challenges associated with the integration of its operations as a result of the acquisition and subsequent expansion of its facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these expenses decreased to for fiscal from for the comparable period in fiscal the largest component of the increase  in dollars  arose principally from the inclusion of c h 
in addition  the increase in dollars was attributable to pre operating costs of jefferson blanking 
other 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal due primarily to increased average borrowings during fiscal that were primarily incurred in connection with the acquisition of c h and other capital expenditures 
interest expense of approximately million relating to expansion of several facilities was capitalized in fiscal the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  representing effective tax rates of and 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a return to a more sustainable level of state incentives for capital investments 
net income 
income from continuing operations for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in fiscal this decrease was substantially the result of lower margins in the tool and die business  lower price for scrap steel that is sold to the secondary steel industry and residual effects from the gm strike 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended october  from million for the comparable period in the increase in revenues is primarily due to the inclusion in fiscal of million in revenues from greenfield 
revenues from the blanking and stamping operations for fiscal increased approximately from the comparable period due to the inclusion of revenue from greenfield  while revenue from the other steel processing operations for fiscal increased approximately from the comparable period in fiscal the percentage of revenues from directly owned steel processed was for fiscal and for the comparable period in fiscal revenues from the toll processed steel were for fiscal and for the comparable period in fiscal the increase in the percentage of revenues from directly owned steel processed was primarily due to the inclusion of greenfield which predominantly processes directly owned steel 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the comparable period in gross margin increased to in fiscal from for the comparable period in the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to higher gross margins realized with the inclusion of greenfield 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million for the comparable period in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these expenses increased to for fiscal from for the comparable period in fiscal the largest component of the increase  both as a percentage of sales and in dollars  arose principally from the inclusion of greenfield 
in addition  the increase was attributable to costs associated with the adoption of a supplemental executive retirement plan  and to a lesser extent  the addition of new personnel at the company s corporate offices 
other 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from  for the comparable period in fiscal due primarily to increased average borrowings during fiscal that were primarily incurred in connection with the acquisition of greenfield 
interest expense of approximately million relating to expansion of several facilities was capitalized in fiscal the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared with million in  representing effective tax rates of and 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to state incentive programs for capital investments 
discontinued operations 
on july   the company sold the stock of shafer valve and accordingly has accounted for this operation as a discontinued operation 
prior year s statements of income and cash flows have been restated to reflect the discontinuation of the valve actuator segment 
net income 
income from continuing operations for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for the comparable period in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of greenfield in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at october   the company had million of working capital  representing a current ratio of to and debt to total capitalization of 
as a result of the financial condition of the company  the company will be able to continue its planned investment in new equipment and facilities through the next fiscal year 
net cash provided by operating activities is primarily generated from net income of the company plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  which because of the capital intensive nature of the company s business  are substantial 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million as compared to million for the comparable period in fiscal fluctuations in working capital were the primary factors causing the increase in net cash provided by operations from fiscal to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities has historically been used by the company to fund a portion of its capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million during the year ended october  and million during fiscal the capital expenditures made during were primarily for expansions of current blanking and stamping facilities of approximately million  as well as million of new construction at jefferson blanking for the completion of their facility expansion 
the company s total projected capital expenditures for fiscal amounts to approximately million 
the capital expenditures in fiscal and fiscal are primarily for facility expansions and additions  which are being made to support current business  anticipated new business and to enhance productivity 
in addition to using cash generated by operating activities to fund the fiscal capital expenditures  the company anticipates funding such activities through additional bank financing 
prior to january   the company had a million unsecured revolving credit facility shiloh facility with keybank national association keybank and shiloh of michigan had a million credit facility the shiloh of michigan facility with keybank 
on january   the company increased the shiloh facility to million 
the term of the shiloh facility extends to january  the company has the option to select the applicable interest rate at keybank s prime rate or the libor rate plus a factor determined by a pricing matrix based on the company s ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
as of october   the factor as determined by the pricing matrix was 
the terms of the agreement also require an annual facility fee as determined by a pricing matrix based on the company s ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
this annual facility fee is currently 
on january   the company used million of the shiloh facility to retire the outstanding balance of the shiloh of michigan facility 
on october   the company had an aggregate of million of availability remaining under such shiloh facility 
the company believes that it currently has sufficient liquidity and available capital resources to meet its existing needs  and the financial capability to increase its long term borrowing level if that becomes appropriate due to changes in its capital requirements 
in march  medina county  ohio issued on behalf of the company an aggregate of million in principal amount of variable rate industrial revenue bonds due  all of which were drawn upon as of october  these bonds are secured by the company with a letter of credit 
the funds from these bonds were used to finance a portion of the expansion at the company s steel pickling operations in valley city  ohio 
year compliance the year problem relates to the computer systems and software that may have a problem distinguishing the dates and because the calendar year date is abbreviated by only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  systems could fail to operate or produce the correct results if the is interpreted to mean rather than if this occurs in a system used by the company or a third party dealing with the company  the results could conceivably have an adverse material effect on the company 
as a key supplier to the automotive and other manufacturing industries  the company s major exposure for the year problems is the effect of shutting down production at one of its customer s facilities 
while lost revenues from such an event are a concern for the company  the greater risks are the consequential damages for which the company could be liable if it in fact is found responsible for the shutdown of a customer s facility 
such a finding could have an adverse material impact on the company s operating results 
the most likely way in which the company would shut down production at a customer s facility is by being unable to supply material or parts to that customer 
the material supplied by the company  in many cases is an integral component of the end products that the customer produces  and the inability to provide them may make the customer unable to manufacture and sell its products 
breakdowns in any number of the company s computer systems and applications could prevent the company from being able to manufacture and ship its products 
examples of such potential failures include  without limitation  failure in the company s manufacturing application software  bar coding system  embedded computer chips in shop floor equipment  and lack of supply of material from its suppliers  or lack of heat  power or water from utilities servicing the company s facilities 
the company s products do not contain computer devices that require remediation to meet the year requirements 
for its information technology  the company currently utilizes an ibm rs computing environment that is complemented by a series of local area networks lans that are connected nationwide via a wide area network wan 
most of the operating systems related to the rss  lans and wan have been or are in the process of being updated to comply with the year requirements 
additionally  upgraded and modified versions of the company s financial  manufacturing including bar coding  payroll  human resources and other software applications which are year ready are available and are now in the process of being integrated into the company s information systems 
the company expects that this integration will be substantially complete by the end of the third calendar quarter of the company utilizes non mainframe computers and software in its various production facilities throughout the country 
an initial internal review of these systems have identified that only a few revisions are necessary to these systems to make them year ready 
the majority of the revisions that have been identified relate to old personal computers or memory chips that must be replaced 
although there can be no assurances that the company will identify and correct every year problem in the computer applications used in its business or production processes  the company believes that it has in place a comprehensive program to identify and correct any such problem 
the plan calls for substantial completion of the remediation of these systems by the end of the third calendar quarter of at this time  the company does not believe that it requires a contingency plan with respect to the information technology  business and production processes and has therefore not developed one 
the company is also reviewing its building and utility systems heat  electrical  water  phones  etc 
for the impact of year many of the systems in this area are currently year compliant 
while the company is diligently working with the providers of these services and has no reason to expect that they will not meet their requirements for year compliance  there can be no assurances that these suppliers will in fact meet the company s requirement 
a failure by any of these suppliers to remediate their systems could potentially cause a shutdown of one or more of the company s facilities  which could impact the company s ability to meet its obligations to deliver products to its customers 
at this time  the company has not developed a contingency plan in the event of a failure caused by a supplier or third party  but would do so if a specific problem is identified 
in some cases  especially with respect to utilities  there may not  however  be an alternative source available 
the company has also started a program to determine the year compliance of their significant equipment and material suppliers 
the company has sent out a comprehensive questionnaire to all of its suppliers regarding their year compliance and is attempting to identify any potential problem areas with respect to them 
this program will be ongoing and the company s efforts with respect to specific problems identified will depend  in part on its assessment of the risk that any such problem may cause the shutdown of a customer s plant or other problem which the company believes would have a material effect on operations 
the company cannot  however  fully control the conduct of its suppliers and there can be no guarantee that year problems originating from a supplier will not occur 
at this time  the company has not developed a contingency plan in the event of a failure caused by a supplier or third party  but would do so if a specific problem is identified 
in some cases there may not be an alternative source available 
as a supplier to the automotive industry  the company takes an active role in many industry sponsored organizations  including the american iron and steel institute aisi and the automotive industry action group aiag 
the aiag has been proactive in working with oems and tier  and suppliers to ensure that the industry as a whole addresses the year problem 
the aiag provides tools to assist in achieving compliance including questionnaires  regular meetings of members  follow up by aiag personnel regarding the answers to the questionnaires  etc 
the company will continue to work with such organizations in order to have access to the tools available to address the year problem 
to date  the company has not spent a material amount on specific year issues 
as of october   the company spent approximately million on a new business system  however  the company cannot quantify the amount directly related to year compliance 
similarly  the company  at this time  cannot quantify the amount to be spent on year issues and compliance matters related thereto 
the information presented above sets forth the key steps taken by the company to address the year problem 
there can be no assurance that third parties will convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s systems 
the company believes that its actions with suppliers will minimize these risks and that the costs of year compliance for its information and production systems will not be material in its consolidated and financial and operational results 
outlook the statements contained in this annual report of form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties with respect to the company s operations in fiscal as well as over the long term such as  without limitations  i a downturn in the automotive industry  which is highly cyclical  dependent on consumer spending and subject to the impact of domestic and international economic conditions and regulations and policies regarding international trade  ii the ability of the company to accomplish its strategic objectives with respect to external expansion through selective acquisitions and internal expansion  iii increases in the price of  or limitations on the availability of steel  the company s primary raw material  iv risks associated with integrating operations of acquired companies  v potential disruptions in operations due to or during facility expansions  vi a labor dispute involving the company  its customers or suppliers and vii the potential inability to adequately address issues relating to the year problems 
any or all of these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements reflect management s analysis only as of the date of the filing of this report 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
in addition to the disclosure contained herein  readers should carefully review risks and uncertainties contained in other documents the company files from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
effect of inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the interest expense of floating rate indebtedness and by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
the general level of inflation has not had a material effect on the company s financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is primarily due to possible fluctuations in interest rates as they relate to its variable rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative financial investments for trading or speculation purposes 
as a result  the company believes that its market risk exposure is not material to the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations
