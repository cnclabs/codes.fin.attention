overview we are a leading independent provider of telecommunications services to businesses  other high usage customers and telecommunications carriers in europe 
we also provide telecommunications services in russia and the commonwealth of independent states cis 
from our inception until  we focused on providing telecommunications services in emerging markets  particularly in russia and establishing and developing hermes europe railtel bv  a venture designed to provide a high speed transmission network across national borders in western europe 
we intended to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand for telecommunications services in countries emerging from totalitarian rule and state controlled economies 
in addition  in western europe  growing liberalization of regulations governing the provision of telecommunications services has resulted in a proliferation of new competitors to the incumbent public telecommunications operators 
at the same time  with the trend toward the increasing globalization of business  there has been substantial growth in demand for high quality voice and data telecommunications 
we perceived a need for a fast  efficient and lower cost cross border network that would carry the traffic of established public telecommunications operators and other carriers 
since we began operating our hermes railtel network in late  the demand for its services has validated our decision to build and develop such a network 
in  we changed our strategy in response to the economic crisis in emerging markets and the advent on january  of the deregulation of the provision of telecommunications services in western europe 
we also sought to build on the success of our hermes railtel network by developing a plan to provide telecommunications services  including local access services  directly to businesses and other customers 
in october we realigned our operations into five lines of business gts carrier services  gts business services  gts access services  gts business services cis and gts mobile services cis 
in march  we added a sixth line of business  gts wholesale services 
our strategy to develop our businesses is to continue the buildout of the hermes railtel network by extending its coverage and by putting in place a cost efficient transatlantic link through our participation in flag atlantic limited  develop local access infrastructure to facilitate our customers access to our network and to exploit what we believe to be an expanding market  capitalize on growth in data ip traffic by expanding our ip based capabilities and product offerings  reinforce and extend market penetration of hermes railtel s network by enhancing the scope  capacity  reliability and efficiency of our infrastructure  and by providing our own local access  and increase high usage retail customer base and route traffic over our own network 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to continue to expand through additional significant acquisitions and by entering into additional joint ventures and other cooperative business relationships 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to make significant acquisitions in the future 
we believe that additional attractive acquisitions opportunities currently exist in western and central europe and in the united states and are continually evaluating these opportunities 
certain of these transactions  if consummated  may be material to our operations and financial condition 
such acquisitions may not be successfully integrated or result in projected benefits 
we may not be able to raise the additional capital necessary to fund such acquisitions and may have to divert resources from other areas 
although we periodically have discussions with other companies to assess opportunities on an ongoing basis  we do not have a definitive agreement with respect to any material acquisition or joint venture 
for a comprehensive discussion of our acquisition strategy  see gts carrier services business and marketing strategy  gts business services business and marketing strategy  gts wholesale services business and marketing strategy  and gts access services business and marketing strategy 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial additional costs and charges associated with this strategy in addition to the capital expenditures related to the expansion of our network and lines of business 
esprit telecom group business combination the following discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resource requirements reflect the restatement of our financial results for and prior periods as a result of the business combination with esprit telecom  which we accounted for as a pooling of interests 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of operations as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  revenues telecommunications services selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization equity in losses of ventures loss from operations interest income interest expense foreign currency losses net loss before income taxes  minority interest and extraordinary loss income taxes net loss before minority interest and extraordinary loss minority interest net loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss debt refinancing net loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
our consolidated revenue increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  significant components of revenue for the year ended december  were business services million  carrier services million and business services cis million 
revenue for the year ended december  was primarily comprised of business services million  business services cis million and access services million 
the growth in revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in our customer base and resulting traffic in all of our operations 
an additional contributor to the revenue growth in was that we followed the consolidation method of accounting for certain business ventures  whereas in  these business ventures were accounted for following the equity method of accounting 
telecommunications services 
our costs associated with providing telecommunications services through our five lines of business in increased to million or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues for the decrease in telecommunication services as a percentage of revenues in is attributable to the growth in our customer revenue offset by increased settlement and interconnect costs paid to third parties and direct network operating and maintenance costs 
although telecommunications services costs as a percentage of revenue have decreased  we are incurring substantial costs related to the implementation of our business strategy 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in is attributable to growth in our customer revenue offset by increases in the number of staff associated with business growth  as well as administrative and marketing costs required for our increased customer base 
we expect to establish sales offices in additional european cities  which involves incurring substantial start up costs 
accordingly  our consolidated results of operations will fluctuate depending on the timing of our expansion strategy 
during a period of rapid expansion  selling  general and administrative expenses will be relatively higher than during more stable periods of growth 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million or of revenues for the year ended december  as compared to million or of revenues for the year ended december  the substantial increase in depreciation and amortization costs is attributable to the depreciation related to the expansion of our network infrastructure that we have undertaken over the past several years 
additionally  we have experienced an increase in amortization expense associated with goodwill that has arisen from our acquisition activities 
losses in ventures 
we recognized losses in our investments in non consolidated ventures of million for the year ended december  as compared to million of the year ended december  included in these losses was our ownership share of earnings of million and losses of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this improvement is primarily the result of our consolidation of certain business ventures that were previously accounted for following the equity method of accounting  offset by a million charge associated with our business operations in russia as a result of the deterioration of the russian economy 
included in the loss was a write off of approximately million  which represented the net balance of certain investments in  and advances to  business ventures in asia and central europe that were previously stated in excess of their net realizable value 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to approximately million in from million in this significant increase in interest expense is attributable to the substantial increase in our outstanding debt obligations during interest income 
interest income for increased to million from million in this increase was due to the interest we earned through our short term investments that has grown  due to the proceeds of our financing activities 
foreign currency loss 
we recognized foreign currency losses of million in as compared to million in the losses in were attributable to the devaluation of the russian ruble and losses on several forward exchange contracts and the weakening of the us dollar versus european currencies in the third and fourth quarters of year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
our consolidated revenue increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was primarily comprised of business services million  business services cis million and access services million 
significant components of revenue for the year ended december  were business services million  business services cis million and access services million and there were no revenues recognized for carrier services during the year ended december  the growth in revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in our customer base and resulting traffic in all of our operations 
telecommunications services 
our costs associated with providing telecommunications services through our five lines of business in increased to million or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues in the increase in telecommunications services as a percentage of revenue is attributable to our increased costs related to network operations without the benefit of a commensurate growth in our customer revenue 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million or of revenues as compared to million or of revenues for the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in is attributable to growth in our customer revenue offset by increases in the number of staff required as a result of business growth as well as administrative and marketing costs required for our increased customer base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million or of revenues for as compared to million or of revenues for this increase in depreciation is primarily due to the expansion of our network offset by a proportional increase in our revenue base 
losses in ventures 
we recognized losses in our investments in non consolidated ventures of million for as compared to million for included in these losses was our equity ownership share of losses of million and million for and  respectively 
additionally  included in the loss was the write off of approximately million  as discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in this increase was attributable to the substantial increase in our outstanding debt obligations during interest income 
interest income for increased to million from million for this increase was due to the interest we earned through our short term investments that has grown  due to the proceeds generated through our financing activities 
foreign currency loss 
we recognized foreign currency losses of million for as compared to million for liquidity and capital resources corporate the telecommunications industry is capital intensive 
in order for us to successfully compete  we will require substantial capital to continue to develop our networks and meet the funding requirements of our operations  including losses from operations  as well as to provide capital for our acquisition and business development initiatives 
we expect that we will spend over billion in cash over the next three years to meet our capital expenditures and operating funding requirements to implement our business plan 
historically  we have raised capital through a combination of public and private offerings of equity and debt securities 
we have received cash proceeds of million  million and million in  and  respectively  net of placement costs  associated with the issuance of our common stock in connection with these offerings  including issuance of warrants and the exercise of stock options 
in addition  the company received million  million and million in gross proceeds in  and  respectively  for a total of approximately billion under various debt securities that were issued by hermes railtel  esprit telecom and ourselves 
we had working capital of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december   including net losses of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during and  we incurred substantial expenditures to build out our network  fund the working capital requirements of our businesses  purchase capital equipment  engage in new development and acquisitions and increase our ownership interest in hermes railtel and in some of our ventures in russia and the cis 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures to fund these requirements 
we believe that our existing cash balances  cash flow received from certain operating ventures and proceeds from the january offering of hermes railtel s notes will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated capital needs over at least the next months 
we expect that we will need to raise additional capital 
in addition  we may decide in the future to initiate a tender or exchange offer or consent solicitations with respect to esprit telecom s outstanding senior notes  if we determine it is advantageous in order to enable us to better integrate esprit telecom into our overall corporate structure 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our estimates 
in particular  the accuracy of our estimates is subject to changes and fluctuations in our revenues  operating costs and development expenses  which can be affected by our ability to effectively and efficiently manage the expansion of the hermes railtel network and operations and the buildout of our local access infrastructure in our targeted metropolitan markets  effectively and efficiently manage the build out of the flag atlantic transatlantic cable  either directly or through our participation in the flag atlantic joint venture  obtain infrastructure contracts  rights of way  licenses  interconnection agreements and other regulatory approvals necessary to complete and operate the hermes railtel network  construct our local access infrastructure and offer telecommunications services to end users  negotiate favorable contracts with suppliers  including large volume discounts on purchases of capital equipment and access markets  attract sufficient numbers of customers and provide and develop services for which customers will subscribe 
our revenues and costs are also dependent upon factors that are not within our control such as political  economic and regulatory changes  changes in technology  increased competition and various factors such as strikes  weather  and performance by third parties in connection with our operations 
due to the uncertainty of these factors  actual revenues and costs may vary from expected amounts  possibly to a material degree  and such variations are likely to affect our future capital requirements 
in addition  if we expand our operations at an accelerated rate or consummate acquisitions  our funding needs will increase  possibly to a significant degree  and we will expend our capital resources sooner than currently expected 
as a result of the foregoing  or if our capital resources otherwise prove to be insufficient  we will need to raise additional capital to execute our current business plan and to fund expected operating losses  as well as to consummate future acquisitions and exploit opportunities to expand and develop our businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate additional financing on favorable terms 
as a result  we may be subject to additional or more restrictive financial covenants  our interest obligations may increase significantly and our existing shareholders may be adversely diluted 
failure to generate sufficient funds in the future  whether from operations or by raising additional debt or equity capital  may require us to delay or abandon some or all of our anticipated expenditures  to sell assets  or both  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
hermes railtel network development of hermes railtel s fiber optic network has required and will continue to require substantial capital 
hermes railtel raised million in gross proceeds from its offering of senior notes in july of which million was placed in escrow as an interest reserve 
we have spent approximately million in cash on network capital expenditures through december  and we expect to incur an additional million through in order to complete the build out of the network and enhance its capacity through the implementation of dense wave division multiplexing technology 
in addition  as of december   we had capitalized million in connection with long term fiber lease arrangements and an additional million is expected to be capitalized through in january  hermes railtel issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and euro million approximately million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due these new senior notes have substantially the same terms as the notes hermes railtel issued in we believe that the net proceeds from the senior notes and the new senior notes  combined with projected internally generated funds  should be sufficient to fund expected capital expenditures as well as payments on the long term fiber lease arrangements 
however  the actual amount and timing of our future requirements may differ materially from our estimates 
any failure to obtain necessary financing may require us to delay or abandon our plans for deploying the remainder of the network 
transoceanic services we are participating in the construction and operation of the flag atlantic transoceanic cable through our interest in the flag atlantic limited joint venture 
see item business gts carrier services transoceanic services 
the terms of the joint venture require that we invest million for our interest in the venture and purchase capacity on the cable for million 
although these expenditures are payable over a number of years  we may be required to cover these payments by posting a fully cash collateralized letter of credit during the second quarter of we expect to fund these cash requirements from existing cash balances 
we may also fund or refinance a portion of these cash requirements through the proceeds of debt or equity financings that we may execute during in addition  the terms of the joint venture contemplate that we will be responsible in part for constructing the european and us backhaul portion of the flag atlantic project  that is  the terrestrial portion of the network connecting the landing points of flag atlantic to paris  london and new york 
at this time  we estimate that our share of the costs associated with this portion of the project will be approximately million  of which approximately million is scheduled to be incurred in we expect to meet this cash requirement through a combination of cash on hand and equity or debt financings 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to fund our expenditures associated with our transoceanic services business or that this business will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow 
access services buildout we plan to provide local access services in up to major european cities by the end of see item business gts access services 
we plan to develop our infrastructure by constructing  purchasing or leasing fiber optic networks  developing microwave transmission networks or through acquisition or partnership 
we project that approximately million will be required through the end of to implement these networks 
we expect to be able to fund these expenditures through a combination of cash on hand and equity and debt financings 
we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the amount and timing of these future capital requirements or other cash requirements for the implementation of our access services plans 
these expenditures will be dependent on many factors  including the rate at which we roll out our access services networks  the types of services we offer  staffing levels  acquisitions and customer growth  as well as other factors that are not within our control  including competitive conditions  regulatory developments and capital costs 
we expect that we will have significant operating and net losses and will record significant net cash outflow  before financing  in coming years in connection with our access services business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to fund the million in projected expenditures or any additional expenditures or that our access services line of business will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow in the future 
liquidity analysis we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we had restricted cash of million and million as of december  and  respectively  that primarily represent amounts held in escrow for debt interest payments 
in  and  we used cash of million  million and million  respectively  for our operating activities 
the significant increase in cash spending for our operations in as compared to is attributable to the growth of our business operations which has resulted in higher operating cash costs and accounts receivable carrying balances 
we also used cash of million  million and million for our investing activities in  and  respectively 
of the million of investing activities  million of cash was spent on business acquisitions principally the plusnet and netsource businesses and million of cash was spent primarily on building our telecommunications networks 
we cannot assure you that our operations will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flow in the future 
if we cannot achieve and sustain operating profitability or positive cash flow from operations  we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations or working capital requirements 
substantially all of our operations are outside the united states and therefore our consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
our operations transact their business in the following significant currencies deutschmark  french franc  british pound sterling  belgian franc  dutch guilder  the russian ruble  and  effective january   the euro 
for those operating companies that transact their business in currencies that are not readily convertible  we attempt to minimize our exposure by indexing our invoices and collections to the applicable dollar foreign currency exchange rate to the extent our costs including interest expense  capital expenditures and equity are incurred in us dollars 
although we are attempting to match revenues  costs  borrowing and repayments in terms of their respective currencies  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  losses and a resulting negative impact on earnings with respect to holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  which include foreign currency devaluations against the us dollar 
furthermore  certain of our operations have notes payable and notes receivable which are denominated in a currency other than their own functional currency or loans linked to the us dollar 
we may also experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings related to these monetary assets and liabilities 
we have developed risk management policies that establish guidelines for managing foreign exchange risk 
we are currently evaluating the materiality of foreign exchange exposures in different countries and the financial instruments available to mitigate this exposure 
our ability to hedge our exposure is limited since certain of our operations are located in countries whose currencies are not easily convertible 
financial hedge instruments for these countries are nonexistent or limited and also pricing of these instruments is often volatile and not always efficient 
we designed and implemented reporting processes to monitor the potential exposure on an ongoing basis in we will use the output of this process to execute financial hedges to cover foreign exchange exposure when practical and economically justified 
in april  we consummated a foreign exchange swap transaction to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure resulting from the issuance of million senior notes issued by hermes railtel 
on august  the russian government and the russia central bank announced the following measures a the repayment of gko treasury bills and ofz federal bonds was suspended  subsequently  secondary trading therein was halted since many russian banks had substantial investments in these securities  severe liquidity problems resulted for the banks  b the value of the ruble was allowed to fluctuate below the ruble us dollar exchange rate corridor that the government had committed to support  which effectively devalued the ruble  c a day moratorium on offshore credit repayments was issued 
the day moratorium was not extended when it expired on november  and it is anticipated that the ruble will continue to be devalued 
due to the devaluation and the end of the day moratorium  there is an ongoing risk that many russian banks may be declared bankrupt 
deposits held at russian banks  other than sberbank  are not insured 
the official exchange rate as of december   was rubles per us dollar  respectively 
the last official exchange rate prior to the suspension of trading on august  was rubles per us dollar 
as a result of the devaluation of the ruble and the consequences of the banking and economic crisis within russia  we recorded a million pre tax charge within our financial statements in the third quarter  that is mainly comprised of foreign currency exchange losses for ruble denominated net monetary assets 
the remainder is associated with estimates for uncollectible accounts receivable and unrecoverable cash deposits in russian banks 
moreover  the russian government has defaulted on payments  and proposed a restructuring  of gko treasury bills and ofz federal bonds which has been criticized by western holders of such obligations 
as a result  it is likely that the russian government and russian businesses will have difficulty accessing western financial markets for the foreseeable future 
the consequences of the russian government s decision on august th and its aftermath remain unclear  but we cannot assure you that these emergency measures  coupled with the policies of russia s new government  will be sufficient to stabilize the currency  enhance liquidity or prevent further economic dislocation 
in particular  we cannot assure you that there will not be a further significant and sudden decline in the value of the ruble and consequent increased exchange related losses and increased loss of investor confidence in the russian economy 
such consequences coupled with an overall downturn in the russian economy and resulting reduced demand for telecommunication services could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
because of this programming convention  software  hardware or firmware may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year use of non year compliant programs could result in system failures  miscalculations or errors causing disruptions of operations or other business problems  including  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions and invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
issues posed by the year issue 
we are exposed to the year issue in a number of ways 
among other things  the year issue might affect our computer hardware and software  telecommunications equipment and other systems with embedded logic among other things  this includes our fire detection  access control systems  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  and uninterruptible power supply  operating partners and organizations upon which we are dependent  local access connections  upon which we are dependent  and supply chain 
our year compliance program 
we have initiated a year compliance program to address the aforementioned risks which the year issue poses and to avoid any material loss or impact to us or our customers due to these risks 
the object of this year compliance program is to ensure that neither the performance nor functionality of our operations are affected by dates  prior to  during and after the scope of the year compliance program includes all of the business functions  locations and resources which are essential to us 
the resources which are within the scope of the year compliance program are  among other things  our computer systems  software  vendor supplied software  telecommunications equipment  third party telecommunications partners and other network service suppliers  environmental and building control systems  internal communication systems and other interfaces with third party services 
as explained below  our efforts to assess our systems as well as non system areas related to year compliance involve a wide ranging assessment of the year problems that may affect us  the development of remedies to address the problems discovered in the assessment phase and testing of the remedies 
assessment phase 
the assessment phase includes internal and third party review of potential risks associated with the availability  integrity and reliability of operational systems necessary to conduct business 
during the assessment phase we have identified substantially all of our major hardware and software platforms  applications  telecommunications equipment and other non it resources that support the business functions 
the assessment phase of the year compliance program further identified the internal and external technical interfaces  third party business relationships and internally developed systems which might be materially impacted by year issues 
our observations from the assessment phase during the third and fourth quarters of is that most of our telecommunications equipment and software has been purchased within the past three years and the majority is already compliant or can be made compliant with minor upgrades 
we completed the assessment phase of our year readiness in the fourth quarter of remediation  prevention and testing phases 
based on those resources identified in the assessment phase  we developed a detailed plan in the fourth quarter of  that will then be followed by an upgrade  a remediation  a prevention and a testing phase in early these phases are expected to be completed during the second quarter of assessment of third party compliance 
as noted above  we have also undertaken under our year compliance program to assess and monitor the progress of third party vendors in resolving year issues 
to ensure the compliance of vendors of hardware and software applications used by us  we are obtaining confirmations from our primary telecommunication vendors  business partners and hardware and software vendors as to what plans  if any  are being developed or are already in place to address their ability to process transactions in the year we intend to continue follow up with any vendors who indicate any material problems in their replies 
we expect to receive statements of intended compliance by mid our worst case scenario 
our worst case scenario would be the failing of our telecommunications equipment  power providers and or interfaces with other telecommunication vendors and either or both of the following a loss of interconnect capacity from one or more major suppliers of transmission capacity  and our inability to record  track or invoice billable minutes which could ultimately cause us to temporarily stop carrying traffic 
these cases would create business interruption at some of our operations and would adversely affect our revenues 
for example  the moscow power authorities have publicly stated that they do not intend to address year issues until problems arise 
however  we have operations that are geographically diversified  therefore  it is not anticipated that the worst case scenario would affect all operations at the same time 
additionally  if power failures occur  we currently have diesel generators at certain of our major sites 
based on our assessment during the third and fourth quarters of  we do not foresee a material loss due to these conditions and management is hopeful that our remediation and testing efforts will ensure that we have addressed our year readiness 
however  we cannot assure you that year non compliance by our systems or the systems of vendors  customers  partners or others will not result in a material adverse effect 
contingency plans 
we are considering a contingency plan to address our worst case scenario  however  certain of the initiatives are subject to execution risk 
this risk would include the ability to have access to diesel fuel or large generators should power failures occur  the ability to quickly replace telecommunications equipment and the ability to contract with alternative telecommunication and maintenance providers at reasonable terms 
moreover  we are further limited in resources in certain geographical regions due to the market volatility and weak economies in which we have business operations  which is discussed in the section business risk factors turmoil in russia and the cis creates significant uncertainty for our operations 
costs related to the year issue 
we expect that we will incur between million to million in expenses to complete the assessment  detailed planning  remediation  prevention and testing phases  exclusive of replacement costs for telecommunications equipment and software  of which approximately million had been incurred during it is estimated that between million to million of the total expenditure will be required to complete the remediation and testing phase  excluding the replacement of telecommunications equipment and software 
we have currently identified that certain telecommunications equipment and software will need to be replaced and we anticipate that we will incur approximately million to replace the identified telecommunications equipment and software 
further  we are currently unable to quantify the total costs that we may incur for the replacement of all telecommunications equipment and software due to the stage of our year readiness review 
these costs will be funded from operating cash flows and expensed as incurred 
in addition  the preceding cost estimate does not include amounts associated with the accelerated acquisition of replacement systems as none are included in the initial assessment during the third and fourth quarters of we do not expect that the costs of addressing our year readiness will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  we cannot assure you that year non compliance by our systems or the systems of vendors  customers  partners or others will not result in a material adverse effect for us 
risks related to the year issue 
although our efforts to be year compliant are intended to minimize the adverse effects of the year issue on our business and operations  the actual effects of the issue will not be known until difficulties in implementing the remediation or prevention phases or failure by us to fully implement the planning or remediation phases or the failure of our major vendors  third party network service providers  and other material service providers and customers to adequately address their respective year issues in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition

impact of the euro implementation in accordance with the treaty on eu  signed at maastricht on february   stage iii of the economic and monetary union emu commenced on january   and a single currency  the euro  has been introduced 
the euro exists in parallel with national currencies  and transactions may be denominated in either currency until december  though only notes and coins of the national currencies will be available for physical exchange 
from january   euro notes and coins will be introduced and national currencies will be withdrawn by june  those participating member states have also transferred authority for conducting monetary policy to the european central bank 
since january   the value of the euro as against the currencies of each of the participating member states has been irrevocably fixed 
those member states which are currently participating in the third stage of emu are austria  belgium  finland  france  germany  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal and spain 
through certain of our subsidiaries we have significant operations within the eu  including many of the countries that adopted the euro 
we are currently evaluating the systems and business issues raised by the adoption of the euro  including preparing business systems for trading in euros and converting the accounting systems of companies in the common currency area from their national currency to euros  the benefit of the elimination of exchange rate risk in cross border transactions within the common currency area  the potential impact of increases in pricing transparency on price differentials between member states  and training and human resources issues 
we are also working actively with key business suppliers and customers to prepare for emu 
in addition  monetary union may have a significant impact on macroeconomic factors  including interest and foreign exchange rates 
looking forward  key commercial risks  such as pricing transparency  are being analyzed by each business  with a view to minimizing any impact through active management in these areas over the emu transition period and beyond 
however  there can be no assurance that the euro will not have a negative impact 
the impact of future entry to emu of other european countries particularly the united kingdom is being similarly analyzed

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our treasury function manages its funding  liquidity  and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks 
our treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorized by our board of directors 
in accordance with our policy  we do not enter into any transactions of a speculative nature 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term obligations and as a global company  we also face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
a portion of our debt obligations are denominated in currencies which expose us to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates 
we have developed risk management policies that establish guidelines for managing foreign exchange risk and we also periodically evaluate the materiality of foreign exchange exposures and the financial instruments available to mitigate this exposure 
our subsidiary  hermes railtel  has entered into a foreign currency swap agreement in order to mitigate our exposure on us dollar denominated debt 
we also attempt to mitigate this and other exposure from debt obligations denominated in exposed currencies by maintaining assets in the exposed currency wherever possible 
we find it impractical to hedge all foreign currency exposure and as a result will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses 
the introduction of the euro as a common currency for most members of the european union occurred on january  we have not determined what impact  if any  the euro will have on our foreign exchange exposure
