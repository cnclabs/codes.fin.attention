overview biosite diagnostics incorporated the company was established in the company has been primarily involved in the research  development  manufacturing and marketing of rapid diagnostic tests 
in  the company began commercial sales of the company s primary product  triage panel for drugs of abuse triage doa panel 
in  the company began selling three additional products  the triage c 
difficile panel  the triage parasite panel and the triage cardiac system 
the company markets the products worldwide primarily through distributors supported by the company s direct sales force 
in addition to focusing its attention on commercial activities associated with these products  the company continues to invest in the research and development of additional rapid tests to aid in the diagnosis of several critical diseases or conditions  including congestive heart failure and certain bacterial infections 
the company also is developing a diagnostic test to aid in the dosing of immunosuppressant drugs 
the principal markets of the company are hospital laboratories and emergency departments 
the company s sales to date have primarily been due to sales of the triage doa panel product line 
the triage doa panel products are marketed pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements in the us hospital market segment by fisher which accounted for of product sales in and in some countries in europe  latin america  the middle east  asia and africa by country specific and regional distributors 
since the launch of the triage doa panel in fiscal  the company experienced continued revenue growth from its triage doa panel product line 
the company believes that the growth in sales of triage doa panel products has slowed and may decline as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more and more prominent in a maturing market 
during  the company received final clearance from the us food and drug administration fda to market the triage cardiac panel and the triage meter together called triage cardiac system and the triage c 
difficile and triage parasite panels in the united states 
the company began selling the triage c 
difficile panel in march and the triage cardiac system in may 
sales of the triage parasite panel were initiated in mid october 
the company anticipates that its results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by the company  market acceptance of current or new products  defense and resolution of patent matters  regulatory delays  product recalls  manufacturing scale up issues  delays  or inefficiencies  shipment problems  seasonal customer demand  the timing of significant orders  changes in reimbursement policies  competitive pressures on average selling prices and changes in the mix of products sold 
operating results would also be adversely affected by a downturn in the market for the company s current and future products  order cancellations or order rescheduling or manufacturing delays 
as a result of manufacturing scale up and capacity constraint issues related to the production of the triage cardiac system  the company developed a backlog of orders for the triage cardiac system during the third and fourth quarter of the company addressed the manufacturing scale up and capacity constraint issues and filled the backlog orders during december and the first quarter of the company manufactures and ships its other products shortly after receipt of orders and has not developed a significant backlog for such products and does not anticipate it will develop a material backlog for such products in the future 
because the company is continuing to increase its operating expenses  primarily for personnel and activities supporting newly introduced products and new product development  the company s operating results would be adversely affected if its sales did not correspondingly increase or if its product development efforts are unsuccessful or are subject to delays 
the company s limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
the company may not sustain revenue growth or return to profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and its operating results may not be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts 
recent developments new products during the first quarter of  the company received final clearance from the us food and drug administration fda to market the triage cardiac panel and the triage meter together called triage cardiac system and the triage c 
difficile panel in the united states 
the triage cardiac system is biosite s first product to utilize the company s triage meter system technology and is designed to deliver precise  quantitative results in a rapid timeframe 
the triage cardiac system may aid in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction ami and provide physicians with an enhanced ability to make treatment decisions in a timely manner 
used in conjunction with the triage meter  the triage cardiac panel quantitatively measures  in a single test device  the level of ck mb  troponin i and myoglobin from a whole blood sample 
the triage c 
difficile panel is a rapid test designed to identify clostridium difficile  an opportunistic pathogen of the intestinal tract that may thrive as a result of broad spectrum antibiotic treatment 
the company began selling the triage c 
difficile panel in march and the triage cardiac system in may 
the company addressed manufacturing scale up and capacity constraint issues related to the production of the triage cardiac system and filled the backlog orders in december and the first quarter of in october  the company received final clearance from the fda to market the triage parasite panel  the company s third product launched in the triage parasite panel is a rapid test designed to simultaneously detect three common waterborne parasites  giardia lamblia  cryptosporidium parvum and entamoeba histolytica dispar  that can cause severe gastrointestinal infections 
sales of the triage parasite panel were initiated in mid october 
research and development in january  novartis finalized its investment of an additional  in biosite in exchange for a convertible debenture as a result of biosite s successful completion of the initial feasibility studies for the neoralchek system formerly the triage neoral system 
the convertible debenture was immediately converted into  shares of common stock of the company based on a conversion price of per share 
additionally  the company and novartis expanded the scope of their collaboration to include the development of a second version of the neoralchek system 
the attainment of certain milestones under the expansion of the collaboration resulted in contract revenues of million during additional payments to biosite will be made if additional milestones are achieved 
the company initiated clinical trials for both versions of the neoralchek system in june and july the clinical trials were suspended in september to permit the company to make improvements to the neoralchek system 
the clinical trials may resume in the first half of the neoralchek systems are designed to provide a cost effective means of measuring a patient s level of cyclosporine on a real time basis in order to enable physicians to optimize the dosing of the therapeutic drug during the patient s visit 
in december  the company initiated clinical trials for the triage bnp and triage lbp systems 
the triage bnp system may be used in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure and the triage lbp system may be used in the diagnosis of sepsis or bacteremia 
biosite discovery program in march  the company introduced its biosite discovery program  a collaborative research and diagnostics development program focused on the identification of new protein markers for acute diseases 
the company will seek to use its expertise in antibody development to help pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners accelerate their research programs 
in return  biosite intends to obtain diagnostic rights to the proteins under study 
biosite will utilize its proprietary omniclonal antibody development technology to develop high affinity antibodies for the characterization and validation of protein targets 
initially  biosite will focus on disease target markers in four core areas cardiovascular  cerebrovascular  infectious disease and oncology 
if the diagnostic utility of a marker is established  it will then be assessed for commercialization potential  with high value markers being added to biosite s product development pipeline 
the company executed its first collaborative agreement under the biosite discovery program in the cardiovascular area with scios in november product distribution agreements as the company has launched three new products in and with the potential launch of additional products from the company s development pipeline  the company has increased the size of its sales force in the us and negotiated a new long term distribution agreement with the fisher healthcare division fisher of the fisher scientific company  the company s distributor of the triage doa panel products in the us hospital market segment 
this long term distribution agreement expanded fisher s role to include the distribution of the triage cardiac system  the triage c 
difficile panel  the triage parasite panel and some of the potential new products in the us medical market 
as a result of a decision by merck  the company s former distributor of triage doa in europe  to refocus away from certain aspects of the human diagnostic business  the company terminated agreements with merck for the development and distribution of the triage cardiac system and the distribution of the triage doa panel product line in december during  the company expended efforts related to transitioning its product distribution in europe from e 
merck to a network of regional distributors 
the company finalized alliances with several european partners  forming a network of distributors to market its products in some european countries 
the company anticipates that it may  if appropriate  enter into additional distribution agreements with respect to its current products  products currently under development and products that it may develop in the future  if any of such products receive the requisite regulatory clearance or approvals 
a failure by any of the company s distribution partners to successfully market the company s products may require that the company distribute its products on a direct basis 
in such circumstances  a failure of the company to successfully market its products on a direct basis would have a material and adverse effect on the company 
litigation in september  behring diagnostics  inc and behring diagnostics  gmbh filed a patent infringement action against the company in the us district court for the district of delaware 
the patent infringement action alleged that the company s triage doa panel products infringed a patent held by the plaintiffs  which expires in august the plaintiffs sought to recover damages of an unspecified amount and to enjoin future sales of the triage doa panel products by the company 
biosite answered the complaint  denying infringement and asserting affirmative defenses that the patent is invalid and unenforceable 
because of a merger  the identity of the plaintiffs changed to dade behring inc  dade behring marburg gmbh and syva company collectively dade behring 
to avoid protracted litigation and continued significant legal defense costs  the company and dade behring executed a settlement agreement in march that resolved all disputes outstanding between the companies 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company obtained a license to the patent and will provide dade behring the option to evaluate certain proprietary antibodies  resulting in a net payment of  to dade behring by biosite 
on april   spectral diagnostics  inc spectral filed a patent infringement action against the company in the us district court for the western district of wisconsin  alleging that the company s triage cardiac panel infringes us patent  which was issued on the date the suit was filed 
spectral sought a permanent injunction and damages 
spectral also sought a preliminary injunction that would enjoin the company from selling the triage cardiac panel 
on july   the court issued an opinion denying the motion for a preliminary injunction 
spectral also moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of infringement 
that motion was denied on july  the established trial date of august  was set aside while the two companies engaged in negotiations in an attempt to arrive at a settlement in regards to all disputes outstanding between biosite and spectral 
in february  a settlement agreement was executed that resolved all disputes between the companies without a material adverse financial impact to biosite

the company s primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  are for the support of its commercialization efforts related to new products  defense and resolution of patent matters including potential licensing of certain technologies patented by others  potential procurement and enforcement of patents  expansion of its manufacturing capacity for new products  potential repurchase of the company s common stock and the continued advancement of research and development efforts 
the company executed agreements to license technologies patented by others which call for cash payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
the company may enter into additional licensing agreements which may include cash payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
the company utilizes credit arrangements with financial institutions to finance the purchase of capital equipment 
as of december   the company had equipment financing lines of credit with financial institutions totaling million  of which million was available for future borrowing 
the million and million lines of credit expire on june  and march   respectively 
additionally  the company utilizes cash generated from operating activities to meet its capital requirements 
the company is evaluating various alternatives in addressing its future facilities expansion needs 
the alternatives being evaluated include negotiations with various parties for the leasing of additional facility space and potentially a new campus corporate facility to be constructed in san diego  which would be adequate for its foreseeable future needs 
if a new campus corporate facility is constructed to meet future needs  the company would not anticipate relocating its operations to the new facility prior to january relocation to a new facility or leasing of additional facility space would be expected to result in an increase in rent upon occupancy 
the company believes that its available cash  cash from operations and funds from existing credit arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy its funding needs for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s working capital and capital expenditure requirements  the company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital  if needed  will be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
the company s future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which the company s new products and products under development are successfully developed  gain market acceptance and become and remain competitive  the timing and results of clinical studies and regulatory actions regarding the company s potential products  the costs and timing of further expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities  facilities expansion needs  and the costs and timing associated with the enforcement  defense and resolution of patent matters  including potential licensing of certain technologies patented by others 
the failure by the company to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of year yk issue the company is implementing a plan to ensure its system  software and facilities infrastructure will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
key financial  information and operational systems have been assessed and approximately of them have been verified as being compliant 
the company is on schedule to have all remaining systems verified as compliant by june  all key suppliers  distributors  financial institutions and others with whom it does business have been contacted by the company to assess their yk readiness  and approximately have stated that they are compliant or will be compliant before december  the company is continuing to communicate with key suppliers  distributors  financial institutions and others and believes that their readiness will not pose significant operational problems for the company  nor have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
to date the company has expended less than  addressing the yk issue and estimates the total cost of the project and contingency plans  if necessary  to be under  the company anticipates that the company will be in compliance with yk requirements by the end of june however  if such modifications and conversions are not made or are not completed in a timely fashion  the yk issue could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
additionally  the systems of other companies on which biosite s systems rely may not be timely converted  which may have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the most likely worst case scenario is that customers would be unable to order products or pay invoices or suppliers would be unable to manufacture or deliver product 
this would result in reduced orders of products and the inability of the company to manufacture product 
the company currently does not have contingency plans in the event it does not complete all phases of the yk program 
however  management is considering contingency plans which involve  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing inventories of key components to the manufacturing process and validating alternate vendors 
the company plans to evaluate the status of the contingency plans by june and determine whether such plans are necessary 
the triage meter and related software is the only product that the company currently sells which needs evaluation for yk readiness  as the other products do not process or store any date and time data 
the triage meter and related software has been tested and shown to properly process and store date and time data between the th and st centuries  and the years and this processing and storage included calculating  comparing  displaying and recording sequence operations involving date and time data 
correct processing of the leap year date and time data has also been demonstrated 
the software functions as intended or expected  regardless of the date

under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivatives instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
the company does have the option to convert its variable rate long term debt arrangements to fixed rate debt arrangements for a nominal transaction fee 
at december   the company had variable rate debt totaling  a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially effect the fair value of the company s financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
additionally  the company s purchases of triage meters from lre are denominated in german deutch marks dm and sales of certain products to some international customers are denominated in the local currency of customers 
the company has on occasion purchased forward exchange contracts to manage this exposure to exchange rate changes 
as of december   the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
total receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies at december  were not material
