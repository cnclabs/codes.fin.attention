professional and outsourcing services revenues for increased million compared to  with the following increases by business segment property and casualty up million  life and financial solutions up million  and international up million 
the increases are principally due to increases in implementation services and in the processing volumes of services provided to new and existing customers 
the increases were partially offset by the elimination of approximately million in revenue that generated no profit related to the florida business process outsourcing bpo unit 
the company s confidence in forecasting the demand for new large enterprise licenses and new services agreements was lower at the end of than it was earlier in the year 
this is primarily due to the continuing impact of year demands on customer resources and decision processes and the emergence of the internet and the resulting changing priorities of some insurance companies 
at the end of the third quarter and during the fourth quarter of  the company completed fewer transactions than were previously forecast 
some of these opportunities were deferred while others were foregone in favor of alternative strategies 
although the company believes that the demands of the year have provided licensing and servicing opportunities with some customers  it also has delayed or prevented other opportunities 
in addition  the year has caused an unprecedented level of investment in systems and remediation services 
the company is unable to accurately predict how the demand for new licensing and services will be affected by these investments 
furthermore  the company believes most insurance companies were required to complete remediation of their policy administration systems by the third quarter of however  many insurance companies information technology it departments are continuing to focus on year remediation issues and testing of their applications  suppliers and data processing environments 
this continuing level of distraction and asset allocation limits the company s ability to accurately predict licensing and services demand over the next twelve to eighteen months 
the company believes that system evaluations and decision processes are also being affected by uncertainties related to the internet 
the emergence of the internet as a viable insurance distribution channel is causing a re evaluation of the traditional methods of distribution for insurance products 
the company also believes that in order for insurance companies to capitalize on this new distribution method they will be required to redesign their business models and related support systems 
the issues raised by the emergence of the internet and related technology requirements will be distracting and confusing for many insurance companies and complicate the process of transitioning the insurance industry to client server architecture 
therefore  customer uncertainty as to their internet and client server business strategies may extend sales cycles for large enterprise systems 
operating expenses cost of revenues employee compensation and benefits for increased compared to the net increase results principally from higher salaries and related costs associated with the growth in professional services staffing being somewhat offset by the transfer of certain employee costs to computer and communication expenses as a result of the company s data center outsourcing agreement with lockheed martin corporation lockheed martin

as a result  certain costs previously included in employee compensation and benefits are now included in computer and communications expense 
had these employee costs not been transferred  computer and communications expenses would have remained relatively unchanged by comparison to last year 
the savings from the outsourcing agreement were offset by increased communications volumes  increased network and pc related expenses and increased license fees for operational data center software 
computer and communications expenses for increased compared to  principally as a result of increased communications  data circuit and maintenance costs associated with the growth of the company s domestic and international outsourcing operations 
depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and capitalized software costs for increased compared to principally due to higher amortization expense resulting from various releases of the company s internally developed software products 
however  as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization expense declined to from in depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and capitalized software costs for increased compared to this increase is due principally to higher amortization expense resulting from the release of version of cyberlife client server life insurance software in october in addition  depreciation expense increased due to the company s increased investment in network and pc hardware 
other operating costs and expenses for decreased compared to principally due to lower consultant  contract loss and bad debt expense  partially offset by increased facility costs and decreased amounts of capitalized software development costs 
other operating costs and expenses for decreased compared to this decrease is primarily due to the elimination of costs and previously referenced revenues for the bpo unit in florida and an increase in amounts capitalized principally related to the continued enhancement and development of s  cyberlife and i 
the decrease was partially offset by increased fees for the use of consultants and independent contractors to satisfy staffing needs for certain development and services activities  as well as increased rent and other facility costs 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for increased compared to  principally due to increased bonus  commission  and rent  partially offset by decreased third party commissions 
as a percentage of revenue  selling general and administrative expenses declined to from in selling  general and administrative expenses for increased compared to  principally from the company s investment in its international sales force and administrative infrastructure 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangibles for increased compared to  principally due to the amortization of costs associated with the acquisition of tlg and the lockheed martin outsourcing arrangement 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles for remained relatively unchanged compared to impairment and acquisition related charges the results of operations in include million of special charges 
these pre tax charges include million related to the acquisition of tlg and million for the impairment of capitalized software development costs which resulted from certain technology related issues and changes in the company s strategy see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation settlement and expenses  net in may  the company resolved a litigation matter with an agreement for the mutual dismissal of all related claims and counterclaims as well as the company s recovery of certain defense costs  with interest 
as a result  the company recorded a million pre tax gain for this recovery during the second quarter of additionally  in february  the company determined it was necessary to increase its estimate of anticipated liability for the costs associated with a verdict in another litigation matter and as of december   recorded an additional million for the costs in this matter 
operating income operating income increased compared to increases in segment operating income were property and casualty up  life and financial solutions up and international up 
the increase in operating income is primarily related to increases in professional services and outsourcing revenues while operating costs increased at a slower rate than the related revenue

because a substantial portion of these revenues are recorded at the time systems are licensed  there can be significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year in the revenues and operating income derived from licensing activities 
this is attributable principally to the timing of customers decisions to enter into license agreements with the company  which the company is unable to control

the company s current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities stood at at december  management believes this is sufficient when combined with the available credit facility to provide for day to day operating needs and the flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities 
at december   the company had available million of its five year million credit facility 
the company also had available a million uncommitted operating line of credit  all of which was outstanding at december  during  the company capitalized million of internal software development costs principally related to the development of its s client server property and casualty software including the incorporation of object oriented technology and support for microsoft windows nt and cyberlife object oriented client server life insurance software  as well as other ongoing projects in support of its domestic and international product strategies 
significant expenditures planned for  excluding any possible business acquisitions and stock repurchases  are as follows acquisition of data processing and communications equipment  support software  buildings  building improvements and office furniture  fixtures and equipment and costs relating to the internal development of software systems 
the company has historically used the cash generated from operations for the development and acquisition of new products  capital expenditures  acquisition of businesses and repurchase of the company s stock 
the company anticipates that  subject to market conditions  it will continue to use its cash for all of these purposes in the future and that projected cash from operations  along with currently available borrowing capacity  will be able to meet presently anticipated needs 
factors that may affect future results the company s operating results and financial condition may be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following  any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from current and historical results or the company s anticipated future results 
currently  the company s business is focused principally within the global property and casualty and life and financial solutions industries 
significant changes in the regulatory or market environment of these industries could impact demand for the company s software products and services 
additionally  there is increasing competition for the company s products and services  and there can be no assurance that the company s current products and services will remain competitive  or that the company s development efforts will produce products with the cost and performance characteristics necessary to remain competitive 
furthermore  the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapid changes in technology and the emergence of the internet as a viable insurance distribution channel 
the company s success will depend on the level of market acceptance of the company s products  technologies and enhancements  and its ability to introduce such products  technologies and enhancements to the market on a timely and cost effective basis  and maintain a labor force sufficiently skilled to compete in the current environment 
contracts with governmental agencies involve a variety of special risks  including the risk of early contract termination by the governmental agency and changes associated with newly elected state administrations or newly appointed regulators 
the timing and amount of the company s revenues are subject to a number of factors  such as the timing of customers decisions to enter into large license agreements with the company  which make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter or year extremely uncertain 
additionally  while management believes that the company s financing needs for the foreseeable future will be satisfied from cash flows from operations and the company s currently existing credit facility  unforeseen events or adverse economic or business trends may significantly increase cash demands beyond those currently anticipated or affect the company s ability to generate raise cash to satisfy financing needs 
a significant portion of both the company s revenue and its operating income is derived from initial licensing charges received as part of the company s software licensing activities 
because a substantial portion of these revenues is recorded at the time new systems are licensed  there can be significant fluctuations from period to period in the revenues and operating income derived from licensing activities 
this is attributable principally to the timing of customers decisions to enter into license agreements with the company  which the company is unable to control 
the company believes that current and potential customers decisions to enter into license agreements with the company may be significantly affected by strategies to make their existing information systems capable of handling the year  however  at this time the company is unable to predict what the future impact  if any  will be 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
year general many existing computer programs were designed to use only two digits to identify a year in date fields 
if not corrected  these applications could fail or produce erroneous results when working with dates of the year and beyond 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company initiated consolidation of its year activities under a centralized year project office 
prior to that  individual business units were responsible for the assessment  remediation  validation and implementation of year corrective actions 
there following seven phases are included in the company s year project planning 
educating the organization on year issues and concerns  the readiness efforts necessary  and preparing for the next phase of the year readiness project 
inventory 
cataloguing all organizational components  including products  external or internal interfaces  hardware and software that may require remediation and testing to adequately address year concerns 
triage 
prioritizing and categorizing all products  equipment  interfaces  data  and facilities identified during the inventory phase 
emphasis is placed on the identification of all mission critical components  those that are least important  and those that fall in the middle assessment 
identifying remediation requirements for each component in order of business risk prioritization determined during triage 
remediation 
repairing  replacing  or retiring components based on the work identified during the assessment phase 
unit tests on repaired applications are also included in this phase 
testing 
testing components that were repaired 
such tests include both system tests and integrated tests in test environments with machine dates advanced to reflect dates in the years and implementation 
migrating systems  applications  and hardware to production environments  installation of replacement systems and the retirement of designated components  as well as finalizing  documenting and taking care of residual activities 
this phase also includes the compilation and retention of supporting documentation that conforms to prescribed corporate standards 
all phases are currently scheduled to be completed during the third quarter of the year issue may potentially affect the company in four areas its product offerings  its service offerings  its internal systems  and its suppliers and trading partners 
product offerings the company has updated the code of its primary product offerings to process dates across the century boundary 
current testing has confirmed the ability of the applications to process data in both centuries 
beyond that  additional testing is scheduled on the company s base products for the first half of in an environment that utilizes accelerated system dates year environment 
this additional testing seeks to confirm that no unanticipated problems will occur due to third party products with which the company s applications are designed to operate 
once all of the company s base products have been tested in a year environment  redundant testing will continue through the remainder of based on current inventories  the company is also in the process of contacting critical  third party dependencies to determine whether remediation efforts or alternative measures to handle year impacts are necessary 
service offerings the company has completed year application code remediation for all domestic property and casualty customers who will be business process outsourcing bpo information technology outsourcing ito customers after december  live customer data is currently being processed on these remediated applications in a production environment 
based upon customer preference  additional testing is scheduled during in a year environment 
this testing is designed to confirm that no unanticipated problems will occur due to third party products with which the company s applications are designed to operate 
internal systems internal systems consist primarily of third party products used by the company for its internal operations which include data center hardware and software  internal financial and human resource systems  and network and pc hardware and software 
the company s blythewood data center has substantially completed its hardware and operating software inventory  assessments  remediation  and testing efforts in order to satisfy year requirements 
as of july   lockheed martin took over the data processing equipment and operational control of the blythewood data center and remaining remediation efforts will be coordinated with lockheed martin 
the company s australian and european data centers have substantially completed their inventory and assessment of hardware and operating software for year requirements 
final implementation for all data centers is scheduled for completion by june  in  the company commenced the process of identifying  selecting and implementing an enterprise wide financial and human resources system to replace its existing systems 
the financial components of the selected solution are substantially operational 
the solution s human resources functionality is scheduled to be fully operational during the third quarter of the selected solution meets year requirements 
the company is inventorying and assessing all of its network and pc hardware and software to determine if any year remediation upgrades will be required 
the majority of the inventory and assessment phases are complete 
the company has also assessed readiness with respect to non it systems which relate primarily to the ordinary maintenance and operation of its physical facilities  such as elevators  heating and air conditioning 
suppliers and trading partners the company s ability to operate is dependent on relationships with certain suppliers and trading partners  such as electric utilities and telephone companies  who provide services to the company s various offices and data centers mission critical suppliers and trading partners 
the company expects to complete the process of identifying all potential mission critical suppliers and trading partners prior to the end of the second quarter of any identified mission critical third party systems and data interfaces will be tested  to the extent practical  in a year environment 
the company s ability to influence cooperation is partially dependent on the significance of the company s relationship with its suppliers and trading partners 
the company anticipates completing this phase of its year readiness project in the second quarter of year costs since  the company estimates that it has incurred approximately million of costs in addressing year remediation issues and will spend approximately million during based on the company s experience to date  it is not anticipated that the completion of the remaining year remediation efforts will have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s past and anticipated future remediation costs are funded by operations 
year risks the company s products are designed to be used with and require use of third party products  such as operating systems and compilers 
also  customers often modify the company s products to suit their unique requirements 
if these third parties experience year failures of their products  or if customers experience system failures as a result of their modifications or for other reasons  the company could become involved in disputes or litigation related to the cause of such system failures 
in addition  the failure to correct material year problems could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations and litigation 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and the company s customers and prospective customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its mission critical suppliers and trading partners 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
the company continues to develop contingency plans to minimize the effect of such disruptions 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in this year section should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading factors that may affect future results above 
euro conversion on january    certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro and have agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
it is also possible that some of the non participating countries may also choose to convert to the euro at a later date 
from january   to december   there will be a transition period  during which the participating countries may conduct transactions in either their legacy currency or the euro 
on january   new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and by july   all legacy currency bills and coins will be withdrawn  finalizing the conversion to the euro 
the company is currently evaluating methods to address the issues involved with the introduction of the euro  including the conversion of its products in the relevant markets and impacts on the processes for preparing taxation and accounting records 
the company is surveying licensees of its products domiciled or doing business in the participating countries 
the needs of each licensee may vary with regards to converting to the euro depending on how and when they choose to convert 
the company is preparing strategies to modify its products licensed in the participating countries to convert to the euro 
these modifications will be made available to licensees for a fee 
implementation of the modifications is the responsibility of each licensee 
company subsidiaries are incorporated in four of the participating countries germany  austria  the netherlands and ireland 
the company has implemented new financial accounting systems that will enable it to convert the affected operations to the euro in a timely and effective manner 
based upon the company s experience to date  it is not anticipated that the euro conversion will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and inflation the company s operations have not proven to be significantly seasonal  though as with many companies in the software business  the fourth quarter tends to be the strongest quarter annually 
quarterly revenues and net income can be expected to vary at times 
this is attributable principally to the timing of customers entering into license agreements with the company 
the company is unable to control the timing of these decisions 
although the company cannot accurately determine the amounts attributable thereto  the company has been affected by inflation through increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
to the extent permitted by the marketplace for the company s products and services  the company attempts to recover increases in costs by periodically increasing prices 
additionally  most of the company s license agreements and long term services agreements provide for annual increases in charges
