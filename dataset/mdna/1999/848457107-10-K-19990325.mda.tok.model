market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
in seeking to minimize risk  the company manages exposure through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and variable rate financing of owned receivables  asset backed securitizations and other assets 
the company is generally able to meet certain targeted objectives through direct fixed and variable rate borrowings 
however  on occasion  derivative financial instruments are utilized to reach these objectives 
interest rate swaps may be used to minimize interest rate exposure when appropriate based on market conditions 
the use of interest rate swaps is minimal  and as of january   the notional amount totaled  the company also entered into a short term interest rate lock in to hedge an anticipated securitization transaction  which was subsequently completed in february the notional amount of this interest rate lock was  at january  in conjunction with its asset backed securitizations  the company recognizes gains representing the present value of estimated future cash flows the company expects to receive over the estimated outstanding securitization period 
certain estimates inherent in determining the present value of these estimated future cash flows are influenced by factors outside the company s control  and  as a result  could materially change in the near term and affect the carrying value of these receivables

a series of comprehensive plans  covering the renovation of internal systems  outside vendor readiness and testing are in place and are being executed in accordance with prescribed time tables 
the renovation phase is progressing  with over of our internal hardware and software systems and facilities year compliant as of january  systems yet to be renovated include those that are dependent on minor third party vendor software upgrades  systems that have been targeted for replacement or renovation in and will be compliant upon installation  and off the shelf pc hardware and software that can be purchased and installed in a short period of time 
at this point  it is anticipated that of the company s internal systems will be year compliant by the end of the first quarter  at mid year and at the end of the third quarter 
contingency plans are currently in place in order to mitigate the impact of possible system failure 
these plans also include contingencies for the renovation of existing systems in the event that replacement systems cannot be installed in a timely manner 
generally  individual systems are being tested as they are renovated 
a fully integrated system test is scheduled to commence in january  lasting approximately six months 
systems not yet renovated will be added to this integrated test as renovation is completed 
the company has also implemented a comprehensive plan to communicate to all critical vendors and suppliers the expectation that they attain year compliance in a timely manner 
to date  the company has received responses from over of these critical vendors and is aggressively pursuing those who have not responded or have responded in an unsatisfactory manner 
contingency plans have been put in place to provide alternate solutions if the progress of certain vendors and suppliers is deemed questionable so as not to jeopardize the company s ability to service customers 
the direct costs associated with the year initiative are expected to range between  and  these costs  totaling  through january   are funded through current operations and expensed as incurred 
risks associated with year failures range from sporadic delays of limited scope all the way to an extended impairment of the company s merchandise receipt  distribution and billing capabilities 
while difficult to predict  the most reasonably likely scenario will include some sporadic delays of limited scope 
while the company believes it is acting prudently in addressing the year issue  it is impossible for any company to ensure complete year compliance 
while it is certainly possible that there may be litigation arising from the year conversion  at this time the company does not anticipate  nor can it estimate  any costs associated with such litigation
