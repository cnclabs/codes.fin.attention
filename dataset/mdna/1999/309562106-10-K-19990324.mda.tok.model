the increase in interest income was driven by increases in the average balances of each category of earning assets 
the increase in the average balances more than offset the basis point decrease in the overall rate earned on average earning assets 
the average balance on taxable securities increased slightly to million 
however  the interest income on these securities decreased thousand 
this decrease is due primarily to a basis point decrease in the average rate earned  which totaled for interest on nontaxable securities increased thousand or due primarily to an million increase in the average balance

total interest expense for was million  an increase of million or from the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to increases in the average balance of each of the interest bearing liabilities 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  which increased basis points to  also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
interest expense on interest bearing demand deposits increased to million due primarily to a million or increase in the average balance 
the average rate paid on these deposits decreased basis points to for interest expense on savings deposits increased thousand or due to an million increase in the average balance and a slight increase in rates paid 
interest on time deposits totaled million for  a thousand or increase from the average rate paid on time deposits equaled  a basis point increase from the prior year

net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of the company s earnings 
net interest income is the excess of the interest income earned on assets over the interest paid for funds to support those assets

tax equivalent net interest income was million for  an increase of thousand or over the net interest margin decreased basis points to compared to in the prior year 
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of earning assets  the related yields  and the associated cost and composition of interest bearing liabilities 
accordingly  portfolio size  composition  and the related yields earned and average rates paid can have a significant impact on net interest income and margin 
the increase in net interest income was driven primarily by a million increase in average earning assets 
this increase was led by a million increase in average loans  which contributed an additional million in interest income over the prior year 
tax equivalent net interest spread decreased basis points to compared to in the prior year 
the decrease is the result of an basis point decrease in the average rate earned on earning assets and an increase of basis points in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities

the reduction in the effective tax rate for is primarily due to an increase in tax exempt income and the realization of investment tax credits through participation in low income housing projects 
financial condition on december   assets were million  a decrease of million or from year end the decrease in assets is primarily due to the relationship between the company s principal subsidiary  farmers bank capital trust co  and the commonwealth of kentucky

this includes policies on a company wide basis that require certain minimum standards to be maintained 
however  the policies also permit the individual subsidiary companies authority to adopt standards that are no less stringent than those included in the company wide policies 
credit decisions are made at the subsidiary bank level under the guidelines established by policy 
the company s internal audit department performs a loan review at each subsidiary bank during the year 
this loan review evaluates loan administration  credit quality  documentation  compliance with company loan standards  and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses at an adequate level based on credit losses specifically identified in the loan portfolio  as well as management s best estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the remainder of the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
many factors are considered when establishing an adequate allowance 
those factors include  but are not limited to the following an assessment of the financial condition of individual borrowers  a determination of the value and adequacy of underlying collateral  a review of historical loss experience  the condition of the local economy  an analysis of the levels and trends of the loan composition  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
actual losses could differ significantly from the amounts estimated by management 
the provision for loan losses decreased thousand in compared to the company had net charge offs of million  a decrease of thousand from million in the allowance for loan losses was of net loans  a decrease of basis points from year end management continues to emphasize collection efforts and evaluation of risks within the portfolio 
the results of this effort can be seen in the million decrease in nonperforming assets for compared to the composition of the company s loan portfolio continues to be diverse with no significant concentration of credit to any particular industry or individual

nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans  loans past due ninety days or more on which interest is still accruing  and restructured loans 
generally  the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful  or when a default of interest or principal has existed days or more  unless such loan is well secured and in the process of collection

remaining funds have been primarily used to increase holdings of highly rated corporate debt by million  tax free obligations by million  and us government agency securities by million 
the purchase of nontaxable obligations of states and political subdivisions is the primary means of managing the company s tax position 
the alternative minimum tax is not expected to impact the company s ability to acquire tax free obligations in the near future as they become available at an attractive yield

for purposes of this analysis  available for sale securities are stated at fair value and held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost

therefore  the company differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in nonmonetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
liquidity the liquidity of the parent company is primarily affected by the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary banks see footnote in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and cash balances maintained 
management expects that in the aggregate  its subsidiary banks will continue to have the ability to dividend adequate funds to the parent company 
the company s objective as it relates to liquidity is to ensure that subsidiary banks have funds available to meet deposit withdrawals and credit demands without unduly penalizing profitability 
in order to maintain a proper level of liquidity  the banks have several sources of funds available on a daily basis which can be used for liquidity purposes 
those sources of funds include the subsidiary banks core deposits  consisting of both business and nonbusiness deposits  cash flow generated by repayment of loan principal and interest  and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
for the longer term  the liquidity position is managed by balancing the maturity structure of the balance sheet 
this process allows for an orderly flow of funds over an extended period of time 
liquid assets consist of cash and due from banks  short term investments  and available for sale investment securities 
at december   such assets totaled million 
for the year ended december   cash and due from banks totaled million 
this represents a decrease of million compared with a million increase during the previous year period 
the decrease in cash and due from banks in and the increase in results primarily from a significant cash deposit received on december  from the commonwealth of kentucky 
this deposit created an unusually high balance in cash at year end net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in the comparison 
net cash used in investing activities increased million  primarily from the result of increased purchases of available for sale investment securities

or and 
or for the years and  respectively 
year compliance the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in computer systems that use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result of methods used by earlier programmers  many computer programs and other equipment using embedded technology  such as microchips  are unable to distinguish the year from the year if left uncorrected this problem could result in a major system failure  miscalculations  and other disruptions of operations 
a number of computer systems which are affected by the year are utilized by the company to operate its day to day business 
most of these systems use software developed by and licensed from third party software vendors 
fcb services  the company s data processing subsidiary  provides essential support for virtually all of the company s subsidiaries as well as providing data processing services to unrelated third party banks 
therefore  it is vital that the year issues are successfully resolved in a timely matter 
failure to appropriately examine and correct systems that are critical to the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial performance 
the company s plan for achieving compliance is not only focused on its own data processing systems  but also on the compliance of its customers 
in particular  commercial loan customers that are not year compliant could become a repayment risk 
therefore  the company is informing its significant commercial loan customers of the need to become year compliant 
the company s initial assessment of commercial loan customers indicates no material impact to the company 
the company will continue to monitor this risk on an ongoing basis 
the company has formed an oversight committee to coordinate the year compliance process 
this process has been divided into five phases as prescribed by regulatory guidelines 
these phases include awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
the awareness  assessment  and renovation phases generally include defining the year problem and gaining executive level support for the resources necessary to perform compliance tasks  establishing a team to develop an overall strategy  assessing the size and complexity of the problem and detailing the magnitude of the effort necessary to address the issues  including noninformation technology systems that are dependent on embedded microchips  and addressing the need for computer code enhancements  hardware and software upgrades  system replacements  vendor certification  and other associated changes 
these first three phases are substantially complete 
the primary results of the first three phases are as follows procedures were established to verify that all new purchases are year compliant  the assessment of mission critical applications was completed in september  and a new year compliant mainframe computer was placed into service in may the validation and implementation phases consist primarily of testing the changes made to any hardware or software component and to the certification of year compliance 
in addition to testing upgraded components  connections with other systems must be verified  and all changes should be accepted by internal and external users 
as with other phases  the company will be in ongoing discussions with its vendors and customers regarding the success of their validation efforts 
however  the company cannot control the success of those efforts 
the validation and implementation phases of the company s plan are in various stages of completion 
testing of mission critical systems is substantially complete and has resulted in satisfactory results 
additional routine testing of mission critical systems is scheduled for completion by the end of march management currently believes that any remaining testing of mission critical systems will also result in satisfactory results 
to date  a significant number of noncritical systems have also been tested and results have been satisfactory 
the company currently plans to have substantially all of its noncritical systems tested by the end of march  with any remaining testing scheduled for completion by the end of june although mission critical testing is nearing completion  the company will continue to monitor and evaluate these systems throughout the remainder of and into the year and take appropriate action in the given circumstances 
during  the company acquired  installed  and tested a new year compliant mainframe 
also  a year compliant version of the data processing software was installed and is currently functioning appropriately 
however  the company continues to maintain its business continuation plans  for which there are several options in place for partial failure 
these plans generally include  but are not limited to  replacing electronic applications with manual processes 
for a system wide failure  the company maintains a hot site agreement with sungard recovery services  inc  a pennsylvania corporation for disaster and recovery services 
this agreement  which has been in place since and tested twice a year  provides replacement mainframe and software for the company to process with in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
the company believes that expenditures required to bring its systems into compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
to date  substantially all of the expenditures have been absorbed in routine annual maintenance contracts and have not been incremental costs to the company 
this includes the company s acquisition and installation of the new mainframe computer for approximately million in primarily via a capital lease  which is being financed and depreciated over a five year period 
the primary reason for acquiring the new mainframe was to replace an older  less effective mainframe and to increase the company s data processing capacity and to take advantage of newer  state of the art technology 
the mainframe acquisition and related costs were anticipated by the company  and were not incurred specifically to address year compliance 
other related costs have been negligible 
the company does not have a system in place for tracking payroll and related costs for the time that internal employees spend on the year project 
the company believes that future expenditures relating specifically to year compliance will not be material 
however  the year problem is pervasive and complex and can potentially affect any computer process 
therefore  no assurance can be given that year compliance can be achieved without additional unanticipated expenditures and uncertainties that might affect future operating results 
the company s year efforts are ongoing and its overall plan  including contingency planning  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires companies to recognize derivatives on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
gains or losses resulting in the changes in fair value of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criteria for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
if the derivative is highly effective  but not perfectly effective and does not exactly offset the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item  the ineffective portion must be recognized in income at the same time the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized on the balance sheet

 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise 
this statement changes the way mortgage banking enterprises and enterprises that conduct operations that are substantially similar to the primary operations of a mortgage banking enterprise account for certain securities and other interests they retain after securitizing mortgage loans that were held for sale 
prior to sfas no 
 mortgage banking enterprises were required to classify all mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale as trading 
this classification resulted in recognizing unrealized gains and losses currently in earnings 
sfas no 
now requires mortgage banking enterprises to classify mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale based on its ability and intent to sell or hold those investments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk created by its core banking activities of extending loans and receiving deposits 
the company s success is largely dependent upon its ability to manage this risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the exposure of the company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although the company manages other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant risk  which could potentially have the largest and a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates earned on assets and paid on liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
other events that could have an adverse impact on the company s performance include changes in general economic and financial conditions  general movements in market interest rates  and changes in consumer preferences 
the company s primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to effectively invest the company s capital and to manage and preserve the value created by its core banking business
