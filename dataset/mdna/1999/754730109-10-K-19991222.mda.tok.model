fiscal was a record year for equity underwriting activity  both in number of new issues and average offering size 
this pace continued only through the first half of fiscal  at which time small and mid cap stocks began to weaken  particularly in certain industry sectors  which severely slowed the new issue deal flow 
investment banking revenues in fiscal were well below recent prior years as a result of several of the company s major sectors of emphasis energy  real estate and health care being out of favor for most of the year and the company being behind schedule in developing a significant technology investment banking and research effort 
the number of managed and co managed underwritings  the vast majority of which were equity related offerings  and the dollar volume of these transactions were as follows new issues for billion  new issues for billion  and new issues for billion

net trading profits increased dramatically over fiscal  reflecting improved corporate and government bond trading results in addition to somewhat improved over the counter equity trading results 
however  due to the changes in the over the counter equity trading regulations and practices in fiscal  the company expects that flat or negative over the counter equity trading results will be the norm  not the exception 
through fiscal  the company s trading profits had remained relatively consistent  derived primarily from client order flow in both over the counter equity and fixed income securities 
the growth in the company s retail client base during the past two fiscal years has led to increased financial service fees 
in the past two years there has been a increase in the number of ira accounts  a increase in money market processing fees  and a increase in transaction fees arising from retail asset based fee account programs  an increasingly popular alternative to the traditional commission based pricing structure 
other income is composed predominantly of postage and handling fees and floor brokerage income

sales commission expense again increased at a rate approximately proportionate to the related revenues 
the slightly higher increase in financial advisor compensation in fiscal over the related revenue reflects the increase in the proportion of independent contractor versus employee financial advisors 
administrative and benefit compensation costs had been increasing at a rate consistent with the growth in total revenues 
however  the fiscal increase exceeded the growth in revenues as a result of continued hiring to support transaction volume  including the personnel acquired in the roney transaction  and the recruiting of investment bankers and research analysts during a period of decreased investment banking revenues 
incentive compensation expenses  including contributions to qualified retirement plans  are based on departmental  subsidiary and firm wide profitability 
lower investment banking results in fiscal resulted in significantly lower incentive compensation accruals for this area 
simultaneously  improved results in other segments partially offset this decline  holding the decrease in total incentive compensation expense to a rate below the decrease in net income 
in contrast  strong underwriting activity in and resulted in record investment banking departmental profits  having a dramatic impact on incentive compensation 
while the costs associated with overall growth continued to affect communications and information processing  fiscal also included costs associated with the integration of roney  preparation for yk  and the merger creating rjfs 
the increases in communications and information processing expense in fiscal and reflected the costs of further enhancement and expansion of the company s systems of internal communication and information dissemination  as well as higher general business volume  which gave rise to increased costs for telephone  printing and supplies 
the completion and occupancy of the third headquarters building in the spring of gave rise to much of the increased occupancy and equipment expenses for that year 
fiscal includes the first full annual effect of this expansion 
for the first time in several years  clearing and floor brokerage increased  a result of increased transaction volume and higher international clearing costs 
as in the past  clearing and floor brokerage expense increased at a rate lower than the growth in related revenues due to the increased productivity of floor brokers and other cost saving measures implemented 
several of the company s branding initiatives impacted business development in fiscal  such as the first full year of the stadium naming rights  general image advertising costs primarily television  and recruiting related programs capitalizing on the creation of rjfs 
in addition  certain costs related to the roney acquisition and subsequent communication and training are included in this expense 
business development expenses rose dramatically in due to increased advertising  both to recruit financial advisors and increase brand name recognition  increased travel and related expenses  particularly by the larger staff of investment bankers and research analysts  the inception of the stadium naming rights contract  and costs associated with larger conferences throughout the company s operations 
while the company was able to hold other expenses relatively constant in  these expenses increased from to at a pace exceeding the growth in revenues 
these expenses include fees paid to outside managers in the company s investment advisory services program  bank service charges  legal expenses and provisions  and amortization of goodwill arising from the roney acquisition 
year the widespread use of computer programs that rely on two digit date programs to perform computations and decision making functions may cause computer systems to malfunction in the year and lead to significant business delays and disruptions in the us and internationally 
the company has revised all critical information technology it internal computer code that it has identified as requiring modification for year compliance  and has successfully tested the revised code for the transition between december  and january   testing will continue throughout and may be continued into january with respect to other dates that could be affected by this problem 
the company will be limiting the introduction of new computer code during this period to protect the integrity of the changes made during this year 
all of the company s securities transactions are processed on software provided by securities industry software sis  a subsidiary of automatic data processing  inc  and the company has closely monitored the progress of sis in revising its software 
based on information received to date  the company believes that sis completed revision and testing of its software on a timely basis 
the company is also monitoring information received from third party vendors regarding their progress in modification of other software used by the company  as well as the progress of other industry suppliers  in addressing this issue 
with respect to non it systems  primarily those located at its headquarters campus and those provided by its telecommunications and satellite service providers  the company has completed the inventory of all systems and confirmed the compliance status of its vendors 
most of these vendors are major national or international companies which have been addressing the year issue for some time 
with the exception of those discussed below  all of the company s subsidiaries are substantially dependent upon the company s year compliance program 
raymond james bank  fsb  raymond james trust company and heritage asset management  inc have received revised computer software from the third party vendors on whom they are dependent and have completed testing of these systems 
eagle asset management  inc has installed a new portfolio management system which has been designed to be year compliant and completed testing of its mission critical systems in september the company has developed a contingency plan for mission critical business functions 
in accordance with industry requirements  the company has established a command center which will operate hours a day between december  and january  to monitor the functioning of its systems and processes 
the securities industry conducted a series of industry wide tests for year compliance between april and july  the company participated in all tests and did not experience any material problems relating to its year code and data revisions 
in general  representatives of the securities industry were satisfied that the tests confirmed substantial success in dealing with the year issue 
the testing process did identify a number of minor communications problems  most of them unrelated to year issues  these problems were identified and successfully resolved during the course of the testing 
the company estimates that its costs for these efforts during this fiscal year were approximately  an additional  will be spent during fiscal because many of the company s basic operating systems are provided by third party vendors  as indicated above  the company s costs for year remediation have been substantially less than the costs incurred by companies which have developed and maintain all their own operating systems 
the impact of this problem on the securities industry will be material  however  since virtually every aspect of the sale of securities and the processing of transactions will be affected 
due to the enormous task facing the securities industry  the interdependent nature of securities transactions  and reliance on third parties such as utilities and telecommunications providers  the company may be adversely affected by this problem in the year depending on whether it and the entities with whom it does business address this issue successfully
