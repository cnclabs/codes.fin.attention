year compliance the company s state of readiness in  the company established a project team to coordinate existing year activities and address remaining year issues 
the team has focused its efforts on three areas information systems software and hardware  software and operating systems included in the c scanner and third party relationships 
the company has reviewed its primary financial and other business information systems and it believes that the systems will be able to manage and manipulate all material data involving the transition from to without functional or data abnormality and without inaccurate results related to such data 
the company primarily uses ask computer system for its enterprise resource planning erp and will be upgraded to manufacturing knowledge mk computer system in which is yk compliant 
the main purpose of the upgrade is to accommodate addtional users to the system and increases in data storage and processing 
had the company decided to continue to use ask computer system for its erp  the cost to make the it yk compliant would be less than  a series of comprehensive training classes for the mk system is scheduled to begin in march the company anticipates the conversion from ask to mk to start in june and fully implemented by august the company estimates the cost for the conversion to be less than  the company has reviewed the software associated with the operation of its scanners to ensure year compliance 
the company is currently upgrading its software with the release of series software that allows digit space on its images and compatibility with previous software image data 
this software is workable on xp systems only 
for non xp systems  a hardware upgrade is necessary in order for the series software to function 
although images from scanners will have for the year  it will not affect their functionality 
should the customer elect not to purchase the upgrade  the company is currently formulating a functional workaround procedure which will likely involve manual labeling of images to indicate the corrected dates 
the company expects this procedure to be in place and communicated to all its affected customers by the second quarter of series completed its beta testing and was released in the first quarter of the company has contacted all its suppliers  especially sole source vendors  and a review is underway to ensure year compliance 
while the company believes the issues associated with year compliance are being addressed  there remains the risk that suppliers may encounter disruptions due to year compliance or the costs associated with implementing computer system changes 
to date  the company has received formal responses from all of its critical suppliers 
most of them have responded that they expect to address all their significant yk issues on a timely basis 
the company regularly reviews and monitors the suppliers yk readiness plans and performance 
based on the company s risk assessment  selective on site reviews may be performed 
risk analysis has been completed with the company s base of suppliers and contingency plans are now being developed and tested 
all testing is targeted to be complete by june  in some cases  to meet yk readiness  the company has replaced suppliers or eliminated suppliers from consideration for new business 
the company has also contracted with multiple transportation companies to provide product delivery alternatives 
fy imatron inc 
form k the company s risks and contingency plan the company is working to identify and analyze the most likely worst case scenarios for third party relationships affected by yk 
these scenarios could include possible infrastructure collapse  the failure of power and water supplies  major transportation disruptions  unforeseen product shortages due to hoarding of products and sub assemblies and failures of communications and financial systems 
any one of these scenarios could have a major and material effect on the company s ability to build its products and deliver services to its customers 
while the company has contingency plans in place to address most issues under its control  an infrastructure problem outside of its control or some combination of several of these problems could result in a delay in product shipments depending on the nature and severity of the problems 
the company would expect that most utilities and service providers would be able to restore service within days although more pervasive system problems involving multiple providers could last two to four weeks or more depending on the complexity of the systems and the effectiveness of their contingency plans 
although the company is dedicating substantial resources towards attaining yk readiness  there is no assurance it will be successful in its efforts to identify and address all yk issues 
even if the company acts in a timely manner to complete all of its assessments  identifies  develops and implements remediation plans believed to be adequate  and develops contingency plans believed to be adequate  some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the company 
estimated costs the company does not expect the costs associated with its year efforts to be substantial 
less than  has been allocated to address the year issue  of which approximately  has been incurred through december  the company s aggregate cost estimate does not include time and costs that may be incurred by the company as a result of the failure of any third parties  including suppliers  to become year compliant or costs to implement any contingency plans 
the discussion above regarding estimated completion dates  costs  risks and other forward looking statements regarding yk is based on the company s best estimates given information that is currently available and is subject to change 
as the company continues to progress with its yk initiatives  it may discover that actual results will differ materially from these estimates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the past the company has held investments consisting of interest bearing investment grade instruments consistent with the company s investment portfolio 
the company has also entered into credit facilities and leasing arrangements 
at december   the company had money market mutual funds  certificates of deposit and commercial paper which mature in less than three months 
additionally  the company maintained leases for five scanners that have been accounted for as capital leases with a total obligation of  as of december  the company s foreign sales are denominated in us dollars 
the company does not believe that it is subject to any material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency or other market risks
