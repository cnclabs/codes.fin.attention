income tax expense the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily a result of non deductible merger expenses recorded in interest rate and market risk the normal course of business activity exposes the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed within an overall asset liability framework for the company 
the principal objectives of asset liability management are to manage the sensitivity of net interest spreads to potential changes in interest rates and to enhance profitability in ways that promise sufficient reward for recognized and controlled risk 
funding positions are kept within predetermined limits designed to ensure that risk taking is not excessive and that liquidity is properly managed 
the company employs a sensitivity analysis in the form of a net interest income simulation to help characterize the market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
the asset liability management process manages the company s interest rate risk position 
the objective of this process is the optimization of the company s financial position  liquidity and net interest income  while maintaining a relatively neutral interest rate sensitive position 
the company uses a simulation modeling process to measure interest rate risk and evaluate potential strategies 
the company s net interest income simulation includes all financial assets and liabilities 
this simulation measures both the term risk and basis risk in the company s asset liabilities 
the simulation also captures the option characteristics of products  such as caps and floors on floating rate loans  the right to pre pay mortgage loans without penalty and the ability of customers to withdraw deposits on demand 
these options are modeled through the use of primarily historical customer behavior and statistical analysis 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix  pricing  and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet 
other interest rate related risks such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 
simulation results quantify interest rate risk under various interest rate scenarios 
management then develops and implements appropriate strategies 
the board of directors regularly reviews the overall interest rate risk position and asset liability management strategies 
the company uses four standard scenarios rates unchanged  expected rates  high rates  and low rates in analyzing interest rate sensitivity 
the expected scenario is based on the company s projected future interest rates  while the high and low rate scenarios cover a basis points upward and downward rate movement 
the company closely monitors each scenario to manage interest rate risk 
as of march   the expected rate simulation indicated an increase in annual net interest income of  or percent relative to the unchanged rate simulation and a  or percent decline in market value 
management estimates the company s annual net interest income would increase approximately  or percent  and decrease approximately  or percent should interest rates instantaneously rise or fall basis points  versus the projection under unchanged rates 
a fair market value analysis of the company s balance sheet calculated under an instantaneous basis point increase in rates over march   estimates a  or percent decrease in market value 
the company estimates a like decrease in rates would decrease market value  or percent 
these changes in market value represent less than percent of the total carrying value of total assets at year end 
these simulated computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions that management may undertake in response to future changes in interest rates 
looking toward managing interest rate risk in fiscal  the company will continue to face term risk and basis risk and may be confronted with several risk scenarios 
if interest rates rise  net interest income may actually increase  if deposit rates lag increases in market rates 
the company could  however  experience significant pressure on net interest income if there is a substantial increase in deposit rates relative to market rates 
this basis risk potentially could be hedged with interest rate caps  but the company believes they are not cost effective in relation to the cost they would mitigate 
a declining interest rate environment might result in a decrease in loan rates  while deposit rates remain relatively stable 
this rate scenario could also create significant risk to net interest income 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis expressed as a percentage of average total assets is referred to as the net interest margin 
the net interest margin represents the average net effective yield on earning assets 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to percent during fiscal from percent during fiscal in addition  the net interest spread decreased basis points to percent during fiscal from percent during fiscal the average balance sheet presents the individual components of net interest income and expense  net interest spread and net interest margin 
the decline in the net interest margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to the decrease in the yield on interest earning assets caused by the decline in market rates during the period 
the yield earned on average loans decreased to percent for fiscal compared to percent in fiscal in addition  the yield earned on mortgage backed securities declined to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the cost of deposits increased slightly to percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal the company also relies on borrowings from the fhlb and other borrowings to fund asset growth and the cost of fhlb advances and other borrowings decreased basis points to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal the company s interest bearing assets tend to reprice more quickly than its interest bearing liabilities causing pressure on the net interest margin in falling rate environments

the bank s asset and liability committee alco has primary responsibility for managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the alco is comprised of three directors and three officers of the bank 
the alco meets two times a week to establish interest rates on loans and deposits and review interest rate sensitivity and liquidity positions 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of exposure to changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities repricing or maturing in a given period of time is commonly referred to as gap 
a positive gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities  a negative gap indicates an excess of interest rate sensitive liabilities over interest rate sensitive assets 
the company s gap position is evaluated continuously and reviewed by the alco in bi weekly meetings 
the company has a positive one year gap of percent as of march  the following table presents the company s interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at march  the gap analysis is prepared using either actual repricing intervals or maturity dates when stated

loan portfolio and concentration since  the company s loan portfolio has grown percent

the community banking group originates primarily construction and acquisition and development loans  non residential real estate mortgages  commercial  consumer and home equity and second mortgage loans in the metro atlanta area 
additionally  ebcg has invested  as of march   in four mezzanine financing loans

this loan category increased  or percent to  at march  compared to  at march  during fiscal  the company grew the portfolio of residential mortgage loans primarily through originations of single family mortgage loans 
residential first mortgages are generally believed to be a conservative investment 
the company s high concentration of residential first mortgages tends to reduce its level of delinquencies and problem loans 
in  the company began a leasing operation which purchased leases from approved lessors 
each credit was underwritten based upon the lessee s cash flow  business prospects and ability to make rental payments

the company understands the risks inherent in interim construction financing and has designed an efficient organization to properly mitigate those risks through strict underwriting and close monitoring of the process 
the company s underwriting criteria consider  among other things  the equity investment of the borrower  the track record and financial condition of the builder  the demand for the type of house to be constructed including a marketing survey of inventory levels by price range and location  the feasibility of house plans and costs  the growth prospects for the economy and the impact of changes in interest rates 
the company has a multi state construction inspection and appraisal network 
its staff closely monitors construction progress and draws throughout the process 
in addition  no single customer accounted for more than percent of the company s loans in fiscal  or the following table exhibits the geographic location of the company s real estate construction and acquisition and development loans

in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically review the reserve for loan losses 
such agencies require the bank to recognize additions to the reserve based on judgments with regard to information available to them at the time of the examination 
management is not aware of any loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss  doubtful or substandard that i have not been disclosed and ii either a represent or result from trends or uncertainties  which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or b represent material credits in which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
construction and acquisition and development loans comprise the largest component of the company s loan portfolio 
construction loans frequently involve greater risk than residential mortgage loans principally due to i the creditworthiness of construction borrowers in general  ii the potential risks associated with securing permanent financing  and iii general market conditions in the housing industry 
the company s investment in equipment leases involves risk because of i the decline in value of the leased equipment  ii the company s reliance on third party lessors for servicing the leases  and iii the location of lessees outside the company s geographic market 
management believes that the bank s credit review and loan monitoring processes are adequate to evaluate and monitor these risks and that the bank s allowance for probable loan losses is adequate in relation to the composition of its loan portfolio 
although the company s non accrual loans as a percentage of loans receivable  net was percent at march   there is a risk that the quality of the company s loan portfolio could decline 
the rapid growth in loans  the concentration of construction loans  and the risk inherent in the lease portfolio each present a risk that the quality of the loan portfolio could decline 
management and the acc  along with regulators  closely monitor total exposure to each market area and price range in determining the appropriate concentrations of construction loans

during the year ended march   the company had no charge offs related to impaired loans 
for the years ended march  and  the average recorded investment in impaired loans was  and  respectively 
the company uses either the cash or cost recovery method to record cash receipts on impaired loans that are on non accrual 
under the cash method  contractual interest is credited to interest income when received 
this method is used when the ultimate collectibility of the total principal is not in doubt 
loans on the cost recovery method may be changed to the cash method when the application of the cash payments has reduced the principal balance to a level where collection of the remaining recorded investment is no longer in doubt

charge offs related to this decline were primarily related to a single lessor in the amount of  all outstanding obligations of this lessor have been charged off to the reserve and  therefore  no further reserve is required in connection with this relationship 
loan loss reserves totaled  and  respectively  at march  and loan loss reserves to total problem assets increased to percent at march  compared to percent at march  an allocation of the reserve for loan losses has been made according to the respective amounts deemed necessary to provide for the probability of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
although other relevant factors are considered  the allocation is primarily based on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional reserve amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
management believes that the reserves for losses on loans are adequate based upon management s evaluation of  among other things  estimated value of the underlying collateral  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money  due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
in the current interest rate environment  liquidity and the maturity structure of the bank s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management the asset and liability committee alco manages the company s liquidity needs to ensure there is sufficient cash flow to satisfy demand for credit and deposit withdrawals  to fund operations and to meet other company obligations and commitments on a timely and cost effective basis

these classifications are based on the bank s level of risk based capital  leverage ratios and its supervisory ratings 
fdicia defines well capitalized banks as entities having a total risk based capital ratio of percent or higher  a tier one risk based capital ratio of percent or higher and a leveraged ratio of percent or higher

computer systems using the two digit format will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause system failures or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
in addition  many software programs and automated systems could fail to recognize the year as a leap year 
the problem is not necessarily limited to computer systems  or any particular industry or field 
year issues could potentially affect any system that has an embedded microchip containing this flaw  such as alarm systems  vaults and elevators 
the company is committed to addressing the year issues and has developed a comprehensive business plan to manage these issues 
the company established team  a group of key employees  mission critical vendors and an outside consulting firm to address the year issues 
team is responsible for ensuring that its in house processing  service providers  and software vendors are fully compliant with the year requirements 
subcommittees have been established throughout the company to identify  address and mitigate key year issues within the organization 
furthermore  team launched an awareness campaign during that will continue through december   that is designed to raise the awareness and encourage input from all company employees 
the company s executive management team receives progress updates on a monthly basis and the board of directors receives updates on a quarterly basis 
the company s year plan has five phases inventory  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
during the inventory phase  team identified all areas with potential year issues 
all hardware and software systems  including all of its equipment such as elevators  alarm systems  atms  vault locks  etc 
that may contain embedded systems have been identified 
the assessment phase involved detailed analysis and planning to determine the method of renovation 
additionally  during the assessment phase  team categorized each issue into one of three levels of priority mission critical  important and non mission critical 
the levels of priority were determined based on the significance of the potential impact on the company 
the inventory and assessment phases are complete 
team has prepared a series of procedures to test each application based on its level of priority 
in order to protect current operations  an isolated test environment has been created to test network and software applications 
testing includes applications  operating systems  hardware  databases and internal and external interfaces 
testing will ensure that applications  and the environment they operate in  can properly process data and dates without compromising computer based entries and record keeping associated with the year date change 
as of march   the renovation and validation phases are complete 
the implementation phase includes any necessary training of users on newly compliant systems  as well as  introduction of such systems into live operating environments 
the implementation phase is substantially complete 
like many other companies  the operations of the company are interconnected with service providers and vendors who provide services  equipment  technology and or software 
therefore  the company s operations could be materially affected if those parties fail to achieve year readiness 
the company remains in constant communication with key vendors 
the company has required vendors to submit in writing their expected and or achieved year date of compliance 
team identified and is tracking more than individual vendors in the assessment phase 
team is monitoring the renovation and testing efforts of these vendors 
additionally  team is conducting testing of vendor provided products 
team has made decisions on a case by case basis to determine whether to continue the current relationship with each vendor or to replace the product or service 
at march  approximately of vendors are compliant  upgraded or have been retired 
the majority of the remaining of vendors being tracked are expected to be fully compliant by september  in addition  team is responsible for evaluating the level of year compliance of material customers including  funds takers  funds providers and capital market asset management counterparties 
customers representing material year related risk have been identified and contacted 
the company is continuing to monitor these customers level of preparedness as related to the year issues 
a year risk rating has been assigned to all parties identified 
in addition  team has appointed an awareness subcommittee that is responsible for increasing customer awareness of the bank s year these efforts will continue throughout the company believes it has addressed each issue related to the year and has taken the necessary steps to minimize the operational  regulatory and legal risks associated 
however  like other banks  the company may experience a decline in the bank s deposit base if customers withdraw a significant amount of deposited funds prior to the year the company is currently addressing the bank s liquidity issues as related to the year team has also addressed the issues related to loan payment performance by borrowers 
it is possible that borrowers may encounter year related issues that could affect their ability to repay loans according to the agreed upon terms 
team has identified and assessed the company s more significant relationships 
while none of these relationships have reported any expectation of material adverse impact as a result of year  the company will continue to monitor these relationships 
as a supplement to the company s business continuation and recovery plans  team has developed a contingency plan that is specific to year issues 
the contingency plan contains the procedures  guidelines  and information relevant to the ongoing successful operation of each line of business before  during and after the new millennium 
critical business continuity plans will be validated as required by current regulatory guidance by june  business continuity planning is based on consideration of the most reasonably likely worst case scenario that could be encountered 
since it is difficult to predict all possible risk scenarios  the company intends to continue to revise these plans on an ongoing basis 
the company has incurred approximately  in direct expenses related to the year requirements 
the company estimates the total direct cost associated with year issues will be approximately  cost associated with the redeployment of personnel to the year project is not included above 
the company has identified and developed plans for all mission critical applications  however  additional expenses may be incurred if problems are encountered which were not previously identified or anticipated 
at this time  management does not believe these expenses will have a material effect on the operations or financial performance of the company 
however  the above discussion includes a number of forward looking statements 
the statements are based upon the information currently available to the company as related to year compliance efforts and the impact on the company s operations by year issues 
various factors could influence actual results to differ materially from those expected through the company s current assessment and estimates  including certain factors that are beyond the company s control 
the factors include  in part a the company s ability to successfully identify systems and programs that are not year compliant  b the company s ability to successfully identify the nature and estimate the cost associated with upgrading or replacing these systems and programs  c the ability of third parties to successfully address and resolve their year issues by the required deadlines and d the company s ability to successfully implement contingency plans  if needed 
recent accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
recently  the fasb issued an exposure draft which proposed deferring the effective date of this statement to all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operation
