item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company participates in floor plan arrangements with several major third party lenders on behalf of its dealers  most of who have financing arrangements with more than one lender 
except as described above  or where it has a direct repurchase agreement with a dealer  the company is under no material obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers 
from time to time the company will voluntarily repurchase a boat for the convenience of the dealer or for another dealer who needs a particular model not readily available from the factory 
the marketing of boats to retail customers is primarily the responsibility of the dealer  whose efforts are supplemented by the company through advertising in boating magazines and participation in regional  national  and international boat shows 
additionally  in order to further promote its products over the years  the company has developed racing programs to participate in the major classes of offshore powerboat races  many of which are regularly televised on networks such as espn  tnn and speed vision 
additionally  fountain single  twin and triple engine racing boats continue to hold their respective world speed records 
the result of these racing victories and world speed records has established the company s products as the highest performing and safest designed offshore boats 
the company believes that the favorable publicity generated by these performance programs contribute to its sales volume 
the company founder and ceo  reggie fountain  has won numerous races in both factory and customer boats  he has also set numerous speed records in both factory and customer boats 
these fountain race boats were  in general  very successful in the various racing circuits in which they competed 
the company constructed two race boats during fiscal and implemented a racing program during fiscal  of which a major engine manufacturer was a sponsor 
in fiscal  the company completed the structure of its racing program with a third boat and captured several world speed records through the summer of calendar with the th victory completed by reggie fountain in new york city in september 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company announced its withdrawal from active racing and proceeded to sell its owned racing boats 
beginning with the racing season  the company stopped racing its owned boats and changed its focus to a lower cost sponsorship basis where the company is only involved in participating on a limited cost basis as sponsor for selective fountain race boat owners 
as part of the marketing program for its line of sport fishing boats  the company sponsors several outstanding sport fishermen in the southern kingfish association circuit 
this competitive circuit sanctions king mackerel tournaments throughout the atlantic and gulf coast from north carolina to texas 
in fiscal  the company s boats and sponsored fishermen dominated this circuit by winning of the top spots 
one fountain fisherman  clayton kirby was named angler of the year and finished in first place 
since fiscal  the fountain fishing team has continued to dominate the ska circuit winning no less than of the top spots annually 
fountain fishermen have won the coveted angler of the year title of the last years 
kirby s son  brandon has won the coveted jr 
angler title of the last years 
the ska tournaments are held weekly and attract from entrants with prize money in excess of  the fountain fishing teams winning record have given our sport fishing boats favorable exposure to serious sport fishermen  in particular with respect to the superior performance of fountain s fishing boat line 
sales order backlog 
the sales order backlog typically builds to approximately boats during the august october dealer allocation period having an estimated sales value of  all of the backlog is generally shipped within months 
during the last year  the company s performance boats increased in sales value to a greater degree than fishing boats  which increased the overall average unit boat price 
in addition  the sale of the first supercruiser contributed to a substantial per boat increase 
the company s fall dealer allocation program is designed to promote early replenishment of the stock in dealer inventories depleted throughout the prime spring and summer selling seasons 
product warranty 
the company warrants its boats against defects in material and workmanship for a period of three years 
the engine manufacturer warrants engines included in the boats 
warranty expenses of  or of sales were incurred in fiscal and were charged off against net income 
a reserve for warranty expenses estimated to be incurred in future years had been recorded and amounted to  at june  for  warranty costs were  or percent of sales 
warranty cost as a percentage of sales are among the lowest in the marine industry thereby reflecting the company s superior construction of its boats 
competition 
competition within the powerboat manufacturing industry is intense 
while the high performance sports boat market comprises only a small segment of all boats manufactured  the higher prices commanded by these boats make it a significant market in terms of total dollars spent 
the manufacturers that compete directly with the company in its market segment include wellcraft division of genmar industries  inc formula  a division of thunderbird products corporation baja boats  a division of brunswick corporation cigarette racing team  inc the company believes that in its market segment  speed  performance  quality  image  and safety are the main competitive factors  with styling and price being somewhat lesser considerations 
the market for fishing boats is much larger than the one for sport boats  but there are many more fishing boat manufacturers than there are sport boat manufacturers 
the company believes that its current owners  many of whom have purchased multiple and increasingly larger boats from the company regenerate a ready waiting market for its expansion into the cruiser and yacht market

the company s subsidiary was notified by the united states environmental protection agency epa and the north carolina department of environment  health and natural resources ncdehnr that it has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp and may incur  or may have incurred  liability for remediation of contamination at the spectron galaxy waste disposal site in elkton  maryland  and the seaboard disposal site  in high point  north carolina  also referred to as the jamestown  north carolina site  respectively  resulting from the disposal of hazardous substances at those sites by a third party contractor of the company  which disposed of approximately  gallons of hazardous waste at the spectron galaxy waste disposal site  according to prp group records 
the group administrator counsel for that site estimates that the company s proportionate share of the total assessment and cleanup costs of million will be approximately  the epa is expected to circulate a draft de minimis ie  small volume contributor settlement agreement to all de minimis prps sometime this summer or fall 
the group administrator indicated that the likely buy out offer in the proposed settlement agreement is anticipated to be approximately per gallon 
accordingly  the company s proportionate share is calculated to be  if the company accepts epa s buyout offer and a consent decree is entered in court in a timely manner  this matter likely will be concluded for the company and all other de minimis prps by the end of  even though completion of site cleanup may take several more years

accordingly  the company s share is 
of the total estimated assessment and cleanup cost of million  or approximately  the group administrator confirmed that this is a revised estimate and that  under the worst case conditions  the company s potential liability at this site is now expected to be no more than  and could be considerably less if the company s subsidiary is eligible for a de minimis settlement agreement likely to be proposed by the epa sometime next year 
a remedial investigation of the site and a feasibility study of cleanup options has been completed  which proposes natural attenuation as the preferred remediation approach 
if approved by the state and epa  the company s share could be as low as  according to the group administrator 
completion of site cleanup could take several years  depending on the cleanup option selected 
the group administrator noted that the company already has paid amounts previously assessed for its proportionate share of the costs 
the company is involved in litigation in texas and north carolina with one of its dealers in austin  texas  concerning termination of the dealer agreement

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as described more fully below at business environment  more than half of the company s shipments to dealers were financed through so called floor plan arrangements with third party lenders pursuant to which the company may be required to repurchase boats repossessed by the lenders if the dealers defaults under his credit arrangement 
the balance of shipments was cod or payment prior to shipment 
generally  the company recognizes a sale when a boat is shipped to a customer  legal title and all other incidents of ownership have passed from the company to the customer  and payment is received from the customers third party commercial lender or from the customer 
this is the method of sales recognition believed to be in use by most boat manufacturers 
the company has developed criteria for determining whether a shipment should be recorded as a sale or as a deferred sale a balance sheet liability 
the criteria for recording a sale are that the boat has been completed and shipped to a customer  that title and all other incidents of ownership have passed to the customer  and that there is no direct commitment to repurchase the boat or to pay floor plan interest beyond the normal sales program terms 
at june   the company estimated the balances in deferred sales to be  and in deferred cost of sales to be  at june    and  there were no commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in the company s written sales program and there were no direct repurchase agreements 
this was because of improved market conditions and strong ongoing consumer demand for boats 
therefore  there were no deferred sales or cost of sales estimated at june     and the differences between the estimates for deferred sales and deferred cost of sales at june  and june  had the effect of increasing the gross margin on sales and net income after taxes for the year by  there was no such effect on fiscal  and the company has a contingent liability to repurchase boats where it participates in the floor plan financing made available to its dealers by third party finance companies 
sales to participating dealers are approved by the respective finance companies 
if a participating dealer does not satisfy its obligation to the lender and the boat is subsequently repossessed by the lender  then the company may be required to repurchase the boat 
the company had a contingent liability of approximately  at june  and for the shipment of boats  which remained uncollected by the finance companies at those dates 
additionally  at june  and  the company had recorded reserves of  and  which represent losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
business environment 
the company s sales have continued to increase each year 
sales for were  up from fiscal the sales volume increase for fiscal was in line with the overall recreational boating industry 
plant utilization stands at about until full production of the new yacht is achieved 
sales for fiscal were  up less than from sales for fiscal sales for fiscal were  in fiscal  the company continued to advertise and market aggressively 
management believes that the company s advertising  marketing  racing  and tournament fishing programs  as well as  its reputation as the builder of the highest quality  best performing  and safest high performance boats in the industry  all contributed in maintaining our performance market share 
typically  each dealer s floor plan credit facilities are secured by the dealer s inventory  and  perhaps  other personal and real property 
in connection with the dealers floor plan arrangements  the company as well as substantially all other major manufacturers has agreed in most instances to repurchase  under certain circumstances  any of its boats which a lender repossesses from a dealer and returns to the company 
in the event that a dealer defaults under its credit line  the lender may invoke the manufacturers repurchase agreements with respect to that dealer 
in that event  all repurchase agreements of all manufacturers supplying a defaulting dealer are generally invoked regardless of the boat or boats with respect to which the dealer has defaulted 
except where there is a direct repurchase agreement with the customer  the company is under no obligation to repurchase boats from its dealers  although it will on occasion voluntarily assist a dealer in selling a boat or repurchase a boat for the convenience of a dealer 
no boats were repurchased in fiscal  and fiscal in connection with floor plan arrangements 
at june   and  the company had recorded a  reserve for losses which may be reasonably expected to be incurred on boat repurchases in future years 
results of operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company designed and implemented a restructuring plan to aggressively improve the company s cost structure  refocus sales and marketing expenditures and divest the company of certain non realizable assets 
in connection with the restructuring plan the company reviewed components of its business for possible improvement of future profitability through reengineering or restructuring 
as part of this plan the company decided to eliminate its direct racing program and reduce the yacht tooling cost carrying value  along with other discontinued unused tooling 
the carrying value of the assets held was reduced to fair value based on estimated realizable value based on future cash flows from use of the asset or sale of the related assets 
the resulting pretax adjustment of  was recorded as a strategic charge in the statement of operations of the company 
during fiscal  the company had a net loss of  or 
per share 
this compares to net income for fiscal of  or 
per share 
the change to a net loss from the previous year s net income is primarily due to the restructuring charge  increased selling expenses and a drop in margins due to the sales mix of fish boats in relation to overall boats 
operating income before strategic charge decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and  in fiscal this was primarily due to a substantial increase in selling expenses and a drop in margins due to a higher number of fishing boats in relation to total boats sold 
the company s gross profit margin as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the gross margin percentage was due to the overall sales mix of boats 
depreciation expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal depreciation expense by asset category was as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal land improvements    buildings    molds plugs    machinery equipment    furniture fixtures    transportation equipment    racing equipment   total    following is a schedule of the net fixed asset additions during fiscal and fiscal fiscal fiscal buildings   land and improvements 
  molds and plugs   construction in progress   machinery equipment 
  furniture fixtures   transportation equipment   racing equipment  total   selling expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal the company continued to promote its products primarily by magazine advertising in fiscal advertising expense was  in fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal these advertising expenditures continue to promote the company s visibility in the recreational marine industry and its boat sales 
management believes that advertising is necessary in order to maintain the company s sales volume and dealer base 
additionally  in an effort to further promote its products  the company continued its offshore racing and tournament fishing programs 
these programs cost  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the company reentered active racing with construction of two race boats during late fiscal added a third one and began a racing program during fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal the company announced its withdrawal from active racing  placed its owned race boats for sale and changed its focus to a lower cost sponsorship basis where the company is only involved in participating on a limited cost basis as sponsor for selective fountain race boat owners 
selling expenses compared for the past three fiscal years were as follows fiscal fiscal fiscal offshore racing and tournament fishing    advertising    salaries commissions    boat shows    dealer incentives    other selling expenses    total    general and administrative expenses include the finance  accounting  legal  personnel  data processing  and administrative operating expenses of the company 
these expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal most of the increase for fiscal over fiscal was due to expenses incurred for iso certification 
interest expense was  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal the increase in interest expense for fiscal was primarily due to an overall increase in loan debt during the first quarter of fiscal for fiscal the company received  in other income  primarily from vendor discounts and a gain of  on the disposal of certain assets 
for fiscal  the company recorded  in racing participation fees  which reduced our overall program cost for that year 
included in other income for fiscal are consulting fees earned by the use of mr 
fountain amounting to  and these were assigned to the company 
liquidity and financial resources 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal amounted to  net loss plus adjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by activities including  in depreciation   in strategic charges  and net of other of  provided net cash of  before changes in assets and liabilities accounts 
however  relatively large amounts were needed to complete investment activities in purchasing property  plant  equipment  inventory and molds 
the ending cash balance was  operations in fiscal provided  in cash 
net income plus depreciation expense provided cash amounting to  however  relatively large amounts were needed to finance investment activities in purchasing property  plant  equipment  inventory and molds 
in addition  the new yacht construction with associated development costs added to the heavy use of cash 
the ending cash balance was  operations for the prior fiscal year provided  in cash 
net income plus depreciation expense provided cash amounting to  however  relatively large amounts were needed to finance investment activities in purchasing property  plant  equipment and molds 
the loss from operations of the discontinued subsidiaries  fountain power  inc and mach performance  inc also contributed to the use of cash 
the ending cash balance was investing activities for fiscal required  including  for property  plant and equipment and  for additional molds and plugs 
increases in other assets required  investing activities for fiscal required  including expenditures for additional molds and plugs amounting to  and for property  plant and equipment for  also  increases in other assets required  investing activities for fiscal required  including expenditures for additional molds and plugs amounting to  and for property  plant and equipment for  also  increases in other assets required  financing activities for fiscal provided  included in this amount are proceeds from issuance of notes payable and long term debt to transamerica business credit corporation and general electric capital corporation for  along with total debt repayment of  financing activities for fiscal provided  included in this amount are proceeds from issuance of notes payable and long term debt to g 
e 
capital corporation for  and the retirement of previous long term debt of  financing activities for fiscal provided  included in this amount are proceeds from issuance of notes payable and long term debt to g 
e 
capital corporation for  and the retirement of all previous long term debt of  the net increase in cash for fiscal was  primarily due from a new  promissory note with transamerica business credit corporation  which included restatement and amendment of certain existing promissory notes with general electric capital corporation 
the net decrease in cash for fiscal was  primarily due to the investment in facilities  equipment and molds 
during fiscal  the company borrowed the remaining  against the initial general electric capital corporation loan  bringing the balance to  less the scheduled monthly principal reductions 
at june   the total outstanding amount was  less scheduled monthly principal reductions 
for fiscal  the company anticipates that the  beginning cash balance along with the net projected increase in cash provided from operations will be sufficient to meet most of the company s liquidity needs of the year 
the company intends to concentrate on reducing capital expenditures and building its cash reserves during fiscal effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the moderate inflation of recent years 
since most of the company s plant and its equipment are relatively new  expenditures for replacements are not expected to be a factor in the near term future 
when raw material costs increase because of inflation  the company attempts to minimize the effect of these increases by using alternative  less costly materials  or by finding less costly sources for the materials it uses 
when the foregoing measures are not possible  its selling prices are increased to recover the cost increases 
the company s products are targeted at the segment of the powerboat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material 
the year a current concern  known as the year or yk bug is expected to effect a large number of computer systems and software during or after the year the concern is that any computer function that requires a date calculation may produce errors 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations  including the company 
the company is taking the steps necessary to prevent these errors from occurring 
with respect to third party providers whose services are critical to the company  the company intends to monitor the efforts of such vendors  as they become year compliant 
management is not presently aware of any year issues that have been encountered by any such third party  which could materially affect the company s operations 
at present  the company has spent  and anticipates  in additional costs in upgrading some of its software and hardware in order to avoid any problems resulting from the millennium bug 
there is no assurance that the company will not experience operational difficulties as a result of year issues
