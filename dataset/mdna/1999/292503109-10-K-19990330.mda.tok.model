our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risks and uncertainties 
we undertake no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date hereof 
the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net sales  certain consolidated statements of income data for the periods indicated 
consolidated statements of income net sales cost of sales gross profit marketing and selling research and development general and administrative restructuring charges loss income from operations other income interest income net loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income results of operations years ended december  and our net sales decreased from net sales 
this decrease was primarily due to decreased unit sales and average selling prices across all printer product lines  with the exception of the novajet registered trademark pro e which was introduced in may also contributing to the decline was the introduction of various rebate programs which were required to match competitive offerings 
in  supplies sales increased over  and accounted for approximately of net sales versus in a shortfall in oem performance also contributed to the decrease in net sales for  accounting for of product sales as compared to for no one customer accounted for of product sales in either or international sales accounted for approximately and of our product sales in and  respectively 
cost of sales includes standard costs related to product shipments  including materials  labor and overhead  inventory reserves and manufacturing variances  and other direct or allocated costs involved in the manufacture  delivery  support and maintenance of products 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to in  from in  causing a comparable decrease in gross margin percentages 
the increase in the cost of sales was due to a large increase to inventory reserves related to certain unprofitable media product lines  croma  and products which are reaching end of life status  unfavorable manufacturing overhead variances  and the write off of various croma assets 
also contributing to the increased cost of sales percentage were the decrease in average selling price and the implementation of rebate programs previously discussed 
we expect improved gross profit margin percentages in due to the actions taken in to increase inventory reserves  write off unusable assets  and focus on more profitable product lines 
our future success will depend on our ability to continue to develop and manufacture competitive higher margin products and achieve cost reductions for our existing products 
marketing and selling expenses were of net sales compared to in and grew by in absolute dollars over most of the increase was related to costs associated with increased staffing  primarily in the supplies and textiles areas  offset by decreases in advertising and trade show activity compared to marketing and selling expenses in are expected to decline from prior periods as we intend to promote our products and support our marketing and selling activities in a more cost effective manner as a result of the fourth quarter consolidation of our printer and supplies business units and our transition to a niche market strategy 
research and development spending grew by in absolute dollars over and increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in the increase in spending was driven by new product development 
we expect to continue to invest significant resources in our strategic programs and enhancements to existing products and consequently expects that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses were of net sales in compared to in the increase in absolute dollars was due in large part to the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we increased the allowance to reflect the worsening accounts receivable balances of a few specific customers  the gradual worsening condition of balances of some asian and european customers  and our adoption of a more conservative method in assessing the creditworthiness of our smaller customers 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded a  restructuring charge to cover the planned cost of our reorganization and related workforce reduction 
these charges reflect steps we took to consolidate business units  focus on niche markets  and improve future growth and profitability 
other income for the year ended december  included payments received under a product development and manufacturing license agreement signed during the first quarter of under this agreement  we are assisting in the development of a wide format color inkjet product targeted for markets outside of our focus 
we received additional reimbursements for engineering expenses and will receive royalties on future product sales  if any 
interest expense in totaled compared to in increased borrowings under our line of credit arrangement caused the increase in interest expense 
interest income in totaled compared to in as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately  we have determined  based upon history of prior operating earnings  our ability to carry back net operating losses to prior years and our expectations for future years  that it would be prudent to record a  valuation allowance for the benefits of future tax deductions that may not be realized 
the effective income tax rate in was  compared to in the lower rate was due primarily to the recording of the deferred tax asset allowance previously described 
the previously described elements caused net loss to stand at  compared to a net income of  years ended december  and our net sales increased over net sales 
this increase was primarily due to sales of our novajet product lines  including sales of the novajet proe series which was shipped in may the supplies business unit continued to contribute to the company s growth with the successful introduction of several new lines of ink and media 
in  supplies sales increased over  and accounted for approximately of net sales versus in our numerous oem arrangements contributed to the increase in net sales for  accounting for of net sales as compared to for no one customer accounted for more than of product sales in  whereas in  one customer accounted for of product sales 
international sales accounted for approximately and of our net sales in and  respectively 
cost of sales includes standard costs related to product shipments  including materials  labor  and overhead  inventory reserves and manufacturing variances  and other direct or allocated costs involved in the manufacture  warehousing  delivery  support and maintenance of products 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales stood at and in and  respectively 
this percentage remained relatively constant due primarily to the mix of sales of higher margin novajet product offsetting the lower margin products cadjet  supplies as a group and accessories 
marketing and selling expenses were of net sales in compared to in and grew by over most of the increase was related to costs associated with increased staffing in our international offices and in the customer support organization  the advertising and promotion of existing and new products  and increased trade show activity compared to the prior year 
research and development expenses were of net sales in compared to in and grew by over the increase in spending was driven by increased project costs and staffing levels related to new product development  in particular in the area of supplies development 
general and administrative expenses were of net sales in and and grew by over the increase in absolute dollars of  was due to higher staffing levels necessary to support an increased level of business  higher consulting expenses  and increased legal costs 
net interest income decreased to in from in due to less cash available for external investment and increased borrowings under the bank line of credit 
our effective income tax rate in was  compared to in the slight decrease in the effective rate was due to a decreased effective rate for state income taxes 
net income was of net sales for both and and increased over for the reasons previously described 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations primarily through cash flow provided from operations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  and working capital of  in comparison  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  and working capital of  as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to the operating loss we sustained in we have received and anticipate we will continue to receive the majority of our cash from collections of accounts receivable from our distributors and oems 
these groups in general have a history of timely payments  however  an increasing percentage of international sales can increase accounts receivable balances due to traditionally slower payments by international customers 
at december   net accounts receivable decreased by  over s year end balance of  the decrease was directly related to decreased sales in and a substantial increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
this decrease was somewhat offset by slower payments of amounts due  particularly for international customers  than we experienced in we invest our excess cash in money market accounts and have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates 
we have not experienced  to date  any losses on our short term investments 
during  we invested cash in short term investments which generated interest income of inventory levels decreased by  at december  from  at the end of this decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in inventory reserves  mainly for croma  excess and obsolete media products  and for products which are reaching end of life 
inventory levels were also reduced due to an overall decrease in sales 
in the years ended december  and  we made capital expenditures of  and  respectively 
expenditures included the initial software purchase of the enterprise wide information system 
expenditures included consulting and other expenses related to the initial implementation of that system 
during  we plan to increase our capital expenditures  especially for tooling relating to new products  computers and related systems and network assets 
at december   the company had available a  revolving line of credit which expires in january  was outstanding under the line of credit at december  and  at december  the line requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
at december   the company was not in compliance with one financial covenant which was subsequently waived by the bank 
the company is currently renegotiating the credit agreement with the bank  including lowering the available amount to  the new line would be secured by certain assets of the company with a borrowing base limited to eligible accounts receivable and inventory and would redefine the financial covenants 
during this process  the bank has permitted the company to continue to make withdrawals from the line 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  funds available from various financing alternatives involving our owned headquarter facilities  and funds available under the bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs 
actual cash requirements may vary from planned amounts  depending on the timing of the launch and extent of acceptance of new products 
there can be no assurances that future cash requirements to fund operations will not require us to seek additional capital  or that such additional capital will be available when required on terms acceptable to us 
to date  inflation has not had a significant effect on our operating results 
year compliance we utilize computer technologies throughout our business to conduct our day to day operations 
computer technologies include both information technology in the form of hardware and software  as well as embedded technology in our facilities systems and equipment 
we must determine whether our products and systems are capable of recognizing and processing date sensitive information properly as the year approaches 
to do so  we are using a multi phased concurrent approach 
specific project phases include awareness  assessment  remediation  validation and implementation 
we have completed the awareness phase of this project 
furthermore  we have nearly completed the assessment phase and are well into the remediation phase 
all of our current products are year compliant 
our recent enterprise wide information system implementation should mitigate most internal problems as the system vendors have represented that these systems are year compliant 
we are actively correcting and replacing those other systems which are not year ready 
we currently intend to substantially complete the remediation  validation and implementation phases of the year project prior to july  this process includes the testing of critical systems to ensure that year readiness has been accomplished 
if we determine that we may be unable to remediate and properly test affected systems on a timely basis  we intend to develop appropriate contingency plans for any such mission critical systems at the time such determination is made 
while we are not presently aware of any significant exposure that our systems will not be properly remediated on a timely basis  there can be no assurances that all year remediation processes will be completed and properly tested before the year  or that contingency plans will sufficiently mitigate the risk of a year readiness problem 
an interruption of our ability to conduct our business due to a year readiness problem could have a material adverse effect on us 
due to the recent implementation of the enterprise wide information system  we estimate that the additional aggregate costs of our year project will not be material 
a portion of these costs  primarily those not related to the implementation of the enterprise wide information system  is not likely to be incremental costs  but rather will represent the redeployment of existing resources 
this reallocation of resources is not expected to have a significant impact on our day to day operations 
the anticipated impact and costs of the project  as well as the date on which we expect to complete the project  are based on our best estimates using information currently available and numerous assumptions about future events 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
based on our current estimates and information currently available  we do not anticipate that the costs associated with this project will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
we are in the process of communicating with our significant suppliers  customers and critical business partners to determine the extent to which we may be vulnerable in the event that those parties fail to properly remediate their own year issues 
we have taken steps to monitor the progress made by those parties  and to the extent possible  plans to test critical system interfaces  as the year approaches 
we will develop appropriate contingency plans in the event that a significant exposure is identified relative to the dependencies on third party systems 
while we are not presently aware of any such significant exposure  there can be no guarantee that the systems of third parties on which we rely will be converted in a timely manner  or that a failure to properly convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on us 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our only financial instruments with market risk exposure are revolving line of credit borrowings  which totaled  at december  the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based upon our cash requirements 
maximum borrowings at any fiscal quarter end during fiscal were  based on the outstanding balance at december   an adverse change in the interest rate underlying these borrowings would result in a  annual change in our pre tax earnings and cash flow 
these instruments are non trading in nature and carry interest at the bank s prime rate at december  or at our option  a rate based on the london interbank overnight rate at december  plus to based upon certain ratios 
our objective in maintaining these variable rate borrowings is the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed rate borrowings
