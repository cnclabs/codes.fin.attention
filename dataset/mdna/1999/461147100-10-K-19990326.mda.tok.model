item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview the company designs  manufactures and markets docking hardware  test head manipulators and tester interfaces  which are used with automatic test equipment ate by semiconductor manufacturers during the testing of wafers and packaged devices 
the company also designs and markets related ate interface products including high performance test sockets  interface boards and probing assemblies 
the company s products are designed to improve the utilization and cost effectiveness of ate including testers  wafer probers and device handlers during the testing of linear  digital and mixed signal integrated circuits ics 
the company s revenues are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and  therefore  fluctuate generally as a result of the cyclicality in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
the company believes that purchases of the company s docking hardware  manipulators and tester interfaces are typically made from its customers capital expenditure budgets  while related ate interface products  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from its customers operating budgets 
during the last three years  the demand for ate by the semiconductor industry has exhibited a high degree of cyclicality 
represented a year of sequential quarterly declines in orders for and sales of the company s products due to a reduced level of semiconductor manufacturing activity which caused cutbacks in semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
marked a turnaround in the semiconductor industry which was evidenced by a renewal in demand for ate and related equipment which resulted in sequential quarterly increases in orders for and sales of the company s products 
 like  represented a year of sequential quarterly declines in orders for and sales of the company s products  however  to a more significant degree 
in early worldwide demand for ics fell dramatically due to excess inventory of older ic designs  and slower transition to new ic designs resulting generally from softening worldwide demand for end user products 
in addition  the economic downturns in many world economies  especially those in southeast asia and japan  exacerbated the semiconductor industry downturn 
the combination of these conditions contributed to a reduced demand for products manufactured by semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn significantly reduced their need for new or additional ate equipment 
the company s financial performance was negatively impacted by these industry conditions 
net sales fell from million in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of the reduced demand for ate is reflected in the company s backlog  which was million at december  compared to million at december  in early  the company has seen a significant increase in the level of orders for its products over the last quarter of  however  the company is cautious about the level of revenues and net income for the first two quarters of due to the continued uncertainty in the semiconductor industry 
on june   the company completed an initial public offering of million common shares through which the company issued million new shares of common stock the offering 
prior to the offering the company was an s corporation  and the net earnings of the company were taxed as income to the company s stockholders for federal and certain new jersey state income tax purposes 
the company terminated its status as an s corporation prior to the closing of the offering and is subject to federal and additional state income taxes for periods after such termination 
on august   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of testdesign corporation testdesign  a privately held california corporation the acquisition 
testdesign is engaged in the design and manufacture of tester interfaces used by the semiconductor industry 
the purchase price was million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock subject to certain adjustments 
compared to revenues 
revenues were million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
the decline in revenues from the prior year is the result of the aforementioned severe downturn that the ate industry experienced during offset  in part  by the revenues of testdesign from its acquisition in august through year end 
gross margin 
gross margin declined to for from in the reduction in gross margin was primarily the result of the additional fixed costs of manufacturing of testdesign which were impacted unfavorably by the significantly reduced revenue levels during the year 
in addition  material costs as a percentage of sales increased over the comparable prior period due to an increase in the level of sales of certain products with a greater component material cost in compared to selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to for  an increase of  or 
the increase was attributable to several factors including the additional salary and commission expenses of testdesign and increased travel expenses incurred in connection with the company s sales activities  higher levels of warranty expenses and increased advertising expenditures 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the additional salary expense of testdesign coupled with a growth in the number of engineering and technical staff offset in part by reductions in spending on research and development materials and travel expenses in as compared to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the additional salary and other administrative costs of testdesign 
also contributing to the increase in were the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition  additional administrative staff  increases in professional fees  and the increase in amortization of certain prepaid expenses 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased to million for from million in  a decrease of  or 
the company s effective tax rate was for compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate was caused by the accrual of federal income tax on the company s earnings due to the change of tax status from s corporation to c corporation in june  offset in part by the implementation of tax favorable corporate structures and a lower percentage of earnings attributable to the company s japanese subsidiary in as compared to compared to revenues 
revenues were a record million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the year to year increase was primarily due to higher levels of shipments of the company s products during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in  which reflects the higher level of manufacturing activity in the semiconductor industry in as compared to the company did not increase sales prices significantly in the company believes that the increase in revenues was from the sales of products used in the testing of mixed signal devices and digital devices such as microprocessors and microcontrollers and numerous other devices used in the automotive  computer  telecommunications and other industries 
gross margin 
gross margin declined to for from in the reduction in gross margin was primarily attributable to a significant increase in the level of sales to ate manufacturers  which increased from approximately of sales in to approximately in in addition  the company experienced an increase in its fixed operations costs in  due to higher occupancy costs associated with the larger new jersey manufacturing facility which was leased in august the decline in gross margin was partially offset by reduced incremental material costs due to volume discounts received in the last two quarters of selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher salary and benefit expenses resulting from the allocation of additional personnel costs to selling expense and  to a lesser extent  salary increases for existing personnel 
the increase in selling expense also reflects an increase in advertising and promotional expenses over the comparable prior period 
in addition  commission expense increased in over the level incurred in due to an increase in the level of commissioned sales to semiconductor manufacturers 
these increases were offset by a reduction in travel and other expenses 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
the decline was primarily attributable to reduced levels of spending on research and development materials in compared to  and  to a lesser extent  to the aforementioned allocation of certain personnel costs to selling expense 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the additional costs associated with shareholder and investor relations and increased expenditures for outside directors fees and professional fees incurred as a public company 
other factors contributing to the increase in were the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the minority interests in the company s three foreign subsidiaries in connection with the offering and salary increases of administrative staff 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million from  for  an increase of million or 
the company s effective tax rate was for compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate was caused by the accrual of federal income tax on the company s earnings due to the change of tax status from s corporation to c corporation in june and  to a lesser extent  a greater percentage of earnings before income taxes and minority interest attributable to the company s japanese subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for was million 
the following discussion of changes in working capital is exclusive of changes in working capital resulting from the testdesign acquisition 
accounts receivable decreased million from december  to december  due to the sequential quarterly reductions in sales levels during inventories remained relatively constant during the year 
refundable domestic and foreign income taxes increased  as a result of lower levels of earnings than were originally forecasted at the time estimated tax payments were made 
other current assets decreased by  because of the amortization of prepaid expenses 
accounts payable decreased  due to lower production levels resulting from the industry slowdown 
accrued expenses decreased  primarily as a result of the timing of payments of previously accrued expenses 
domestic and foreign income taxes payable decreased million as a result of the payment of previously accrued federal  state and foreign income taxes on earnings 
purchases of machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements were  for the company plans to spend approximately  during the second quarter of to renovate and expand its uk manufacturing facility and purchase a coordinate measuring machine for this facility 
at december   the company had no outstanding long or short term debt 
during  the company repaid  on a non interest bearing note related to the acquisition of testdesign 
the company realized net cash proceeds of million after payment of direct expenses of the offering from the sale of million newly issued shares in the offering in june the proceeds from the offering are being used for working capital  general corporate purposes and possible acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products complementary to the company s business 
on august   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of testdesign corporation testdesign  a privately held california corporation the acquisition 
the purchase price was million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock subject to certain adjustments 
the acquisition of testdesign  which was accounted for using the purchase method  resulted in goodwill of million  which is being amortized over a period of years 
in addition  the company incurred transactions costs of approximately  in connection with the acquisition 
the company funded the cash portion of the purchase price from its cash on hand 
at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents included million of temporary investments attributable to the offering 
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalents  its million unused line of credit and the anticipated net cash provided from operations in will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash requirements including those of its new subsidiary for the foreseeable future 
however  additional acquisitions may require additional equity or debt financing to meet working capital requirements or capital expenditure needs 
although the company  as an s corporation  historically paid cash dividends to its stockholders  the company does not anticipate that it will pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
currently  the company has a program in process to analyze potentially affected business and process systems and replace or correct all non compliant critical business and process systems that it will require in the new millennium 
prior to the acquisition of testdesign  the company had completed its review and testing of its then existing systems and determined that they were year compliant 
the company has identified those systems of testdesign that are not yet year compliant and has begun converting them to systems which are year compliant 
the company has substantially completed the system modifications at testdesign and anticipates that all of its systems will be year compliant by mid the products that the company has sold and currently sells are not date sensitive  and therefore the company believes its product related year exposures are low 
in conjunction with the company s year effort  all suppliers that are critical to the function of the company are being surveyed to insure readiness and non disruption to the company s supply chain 
the company relies on subcontractors for fabrication and certain other processes performed on its products and utilizes third party network equipment and software products which may or may not be year compliant 
in addition  the company relies on utility and telecommunications suppliers to operate its businesses worldwide 
the company has sent questionnaires to these critical suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s operations are exposed to failure from year issues 
the company has received responses from over of its domestic suppliers and is still awaiting responses from most of its foreign suppliers 
the company intends to replace any critical raw materials and fabrication suppliers which cannot demonstrate year compliance before the end of the third quarter of there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to identify and resolve any year issues involving its suppliers or to continue receiving products and services from these suppliers if year problems were to materialize 
the failure to resolve these issues could result in the shut down of some or all of the company s operations  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the total expense of the company s year effort is currently estimated at less than  for the identification and remediation of any year problems related to the company s internal systems 
if required modifications to existing software and hardware are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
there can be no assurance that the costs to remediate any year problems which may be identified in the future will not exceed the company s current estimate or that the company will be able to resolve these issues in a timely manner 
the expenses of the year project are being funded through operating cash flows 
the company does not currently have any information concerning year compliance of its customers 
if any of the company s significant customers and suppliers do not successfully and in a timely manner achieve year compliance  and as a result of such non compliance such customers operations are disrupted  shut down or otherwise impacted  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that another company s failure to ensure year capability would not have an adverse effect on the company 
the company has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations which it believes to be beyond its control ie such as utilities and telecommunications 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop a contingency plan that will adequately address such issues that may arise in the year the failure of the company to successfully resolve such issues could result in a shut down of some or all of the company s operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
exposure to international operations revenues generated by the company s foreign subsidiaries were  and of consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company anticipates that revenues generated by the company s foreign subsidiaries will continue to account for a significant portion of consolidated revenues in the foreseeable future 
these revenues generated by the company s foreign subsidiaries will continue to be subject to certain risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  an outbreak of hostilities  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  potentially adverse tax consequences and the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
the company cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be implemented by the united states or any other country upon the importation or exportation of the company s products in the future 
any of these factors or the adoption of restrictive policies could have a material adverse effect on the company business  financial condition or results of operations 
revenues denominated in foreign currencies were  and of consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although the company operates its business such that a significant portion of its product costs are denominated in the same currency that the associated sales are made in  there can be no assurance that the company will not be adversely impacted in the future due to its exposure to foreign operations 
revenues denominated in currencies other than us dollars expose the company to currency fluctuations  which can adversely effect results of operations 
during the year ended december   the company experienced foreign currency transaction gains of  while during the years ended december  and  the company experienced foreign exchange transaction losses of  and  respectively 
the currency exchange translation gain in is primarily the result of the strengthening of the japanese yen against the us dollar during the portion of the company s consolidated revenues derived from sales to the asia pacific region were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  have experienced economic instability resulting in weaknesses in their currency  banking and equity markets 
although the current economic instability in the asia pacific region has not materially adversely affected the company s order backlog  balance sheet  or results of operations to date  there can be no assurance that continued economic instability will not in the future have a material adverse affect on demand for the company s products and its consolidated results of operations

in addition to the factors described in this report  the company s actual consolidated quarterly or annual operating results have been affected in the past  or could be affected in the future  by additional factors  including  without limitation changes in business conditions and the economy  generally  the ability of the company to obtain patent protection  and enforce its patent rights  for existing and developing proprietary technologies  the ability of the company to integrate successfully businesses  technologies or products which it may acquire  the effect of the loss of  or reduction in orders from  a major customer  and competition from other manufacturers of docking hardware  test head manipulators  tester interfaces and related ate interface products 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to currency exchange rate risk in the normal course of its business 
the company employs risk management strategies including the use of forward exchange rate contracts to manage this exposure 
the company s objective in managing currency exchange risk is to minimize the impact of significant currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily in the japanese yen 
the company s japanese operations expose its earnings to change in currency exchange rates because it s japanese subsidiary makes its sales in japanese yen and purchases its sales inventory in us dollars 
forward exchange rate contracts are used to establish a fixed conversion rate between the japanese yen and the us dollar so that the level of the company s gross margin from sales in japan is not negatively impacted from significant movements in the japanese yen to us dollar exchange rate 
the company purchases forward exchange rate contracts on a monthly basis in the amounts necessary to pay the us dollar denominated obligations of its japanese subsidiary 
as of december   there were no forward exchange rate contracts outstanding 
it is the company s policy to enter into forward exchange rate contracts only to the extent necessary to achieve the desired objectives of management in limiting the company s exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the company does not hedge all of its currency exchange rate risk exposures in a manner that would completely eliminate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on its net income 
the company does not expect that its results of operations or liquidity will be materially affected by these risk management activities 
the notional amounts of the company s forward exchange rate contracts are used only to satisfy current payments to material vendors to be exchanged and are not a measure of the company s credit risk or its future cash requirements 
exchange risk related to forward exchange rate contracts is limited to movement in the exchange rates that would provide a more favorable exchange rate than that locked in the forward contract and forward contract amounts purchased in excess of the amount needed by the company to satisfy its obligations 
the company manages that rate risk by limiting the size of the forward contracts purchased to the known amount of obligations due and not purchasing forward contracts with settlement dates beyond days 
the company believes that the risk of loss due to exchange rate fluctuations is remote and that any losses would not be material to its financial condition or results of operations
