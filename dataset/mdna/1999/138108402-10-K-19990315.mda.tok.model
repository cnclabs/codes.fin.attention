liquidity and capital resources working capital at november  was  this was a reduction of  from the previous year 
two significant factors caused this reduction 
first  there was a reclassification of  of deferred income tax benefit from current to long term  to properly reflect the future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
secondly  based on the restructured loan agreement with chase bank  an additional  of bank debt has been classified as current 
the company s outstanding amounts owed under the term loan and credit line with chase bank were due and payable at december  the company and its lender have agreed to an extension of these agreements through december  subject to satisfactory documentation of the terms and conditions as agreed 
the company will continue to use its best efforts to replace its primary lender prior to that time 
subsequent to november  the company has paid  to reduce its term loan from  to  as of march  the agreement calls for the company to make additional payments in totaling  with the remaining balance of  due december  the term debt and the revolving credit line will accrue interest at prime plus per annum 
on march   the company completed a private placement offering with non affiliates for the issuance of  shares of common stock and the issuance of  shares of common stock as a finders fee  all with registration rights 
the company has received proceeds of  the company used  in proceeds to repay amounts under the term loan 
the remaining amounts are intended to be used for further paydown of debt  general corporate purposes and for working capital 
management believes that positive cash flow contributions from the company s operating subsidiaries will be sufficient to cover cash flow requirements for fiscal there was no material commitment for capital expenditures as of november  inflation was not a significant factor in the company s financial statements 
cash flow from continuing operations for the year ended november  was  this was the fourth consecutive year of positive cash from continuing operations 
during the year  the company reduced its long term bank debt by  for the past three years  the reduction in long term debt totals  general description of the year issue and the nature and effects of the year on information technology it and non it systems 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business practices 
the company began addressing the year issue in on a decentralized basis at each of its subsidiaries 
in  the company began monitoring progress on a corporate level 
based on assessments made since  the company determined that modifications to or in limited cases replacement of computer software and hardware was necessary to enable those systems to operate properly after december  the company presently believes that with modifications to and replacement of existing software and hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue may have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date  the company has completed its assessment of all systems that could be significantly affected by the year the assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems could be affected  particularly the company s registration scheduling and accounting systems 
the assessment also indicated that software and hardware embedded chips used in these applications were also at risk 
the software developed and distributed by atm canterbury is yk compliant 
the company s other training services are not at risk 
status of progress in becoming year compliant  including timetable for completion of each remaining phase the following estimates of completion percentages and dates are based on the company s best estimates 
however  there can be no guarantee that these dates can be achieved and actual results may differ 
for its information technology exposures  to date the company is approximately complete on the remediation phase and expects to be completed with its software reprogramming and replacement no later than march  once software is reprogrammed or replaced for a system  the company begins testing and implementation 
these phases run concurrently for different systems 
to date  the company has completed of its testing and has implemented of its remediated systems 
completion of the testing phase for all significant operating systems is expected by april   with all remediated systems fully tested and implemented by july  nature and level of importance of third parties and their exposure to the year the company is planning to survey its significant vendors as to their year compliance in march and april  based on the nature of their responses  the company will develop contingency plans as appropriate 
however  the company has no means of assuring that external vendors will be year compliant 
the inability of these third parties to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
costs the company has utilized and will continue to utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
many of the program fixes were completed in conjunction with other projects and had little incremental cost 
the company estimates that incremental costs relating to year projects to date approximate  these costs have been expensed as incurred 
the company expects to spend less than  on year projects in fiscal year costs are difficult to estimate accurately and the projected cost could change due to unanticipated technical difficulties  project delays  and third party non compliance  among other things 
risks management of the company believes that it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of its year plan 
because of the range of possible issues and the large number of variables involved  it is impossible to quantify the potential cost of problems should the company or its trading partners not properly complete their year plans and become year compliant 
such costs and any failure of compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that the most likely risks of serious year business disruption are external in nature  including continuity of utility  telecommunication and transportation services  and the potential failure of the company s customers due to their own non compliance or the non compliance of their business partners 
in the event the company does not properly complete its year efforts or is affected by the disruption of outside services  the company could be unable to take orders  distribute goods  invoice customers or collect payments 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems failure 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
contingency plans the company is currently in process of developing contingency plans to address the above year risks as necessary 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion of its year efforts by april  and to determine what contingency plans are necessary at that time 
in the normal course of business  the company has contingency plans for disruption of business events and intends to augment those plans with specific year considerations

costs and expenses costs and expenses decreased by  in fiscal over the previous year 
this most significant cause of this decrease was the reduction in rent expense of  in versus the reduction was due primarily to the company recognizing in costs associated with terminating certain leases for its management training company s facilities

general and administrative expense decreased by  in fiscal over fiscal decreased legal expenses of  consulting fees of  and general public company corporate expenses of  comprise the bulk of the reduction 
the company believes that the reduced level of these expenses will continue into fiscal interest income for fiscal increased by  over the prior year due to recognition of interest income on the portion of the company s revolving credit facility with chase bank that was assumed by the owners of landscape maintenance services 
this income was not recognized in fiscal interest expense decreased by  in fiscal versus fiscal the reduction in outstanding borrowings on the term loan is the major cause for this reduction

costs and expenses costs and expenses increased by  in fiscal over the previous year 
this increase was caused by various factors 
rent expense increased by  due to the company establishing lease termination reserves  increasing the number of classrooms for computer training  as well as reserving for the relocation of calc canterbury and msi canterbury into customized office and classroom space in parsippany  new jersey 
subcontract labor for calc canterbury increased by  for two reasons 
first  there was a significant increase in technical training classes offered in  which resulted in the need for more consultants to train these high end courses 
secondly  there was approximately  spent for programming a new operational accounting system which will allow for both year compliance and increased reporting and processing capabilities 
over  of the increase in was attributed to the acquisition of atm canterbury in may   as well as prosoft canterbury operating for a full year in versus selling expense decreased by  in fiscal over fiscal due to lower commission expense and a reduction in sales personnel through the first nine months of fiscal general and administrative expense increased by  in fiscal over fiscal increased legal fees associated with the settlement and restructuring of the chase banking relationship as well as higher consulting fees for the corporate office caused this increase 
the company believes that both these expenses are non recurring

interest income for fiscal increased by  over fiscal due to the payments from the note receivable generated by the sale of landscape maintenance services  inc in november  interest expense decreased by  in fiscal versus fiscal the reduction in outstanding borrowings on the term loan is the major cause for this reduction 
other expenses of  in fiscal were due primarily to a  charge representing the difference between the unpaid balance of a note receivable and the estimated current value of the collateral supporting the note
