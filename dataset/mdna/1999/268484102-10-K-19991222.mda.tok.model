the company is controlled by its principal shareholder  and this could delay or prevent a change of control of the company as of november   james r 
crane owned approximately of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
as a result  mr 
crane individually will be in a position to control the company through his ability to significantly influence the outcome of elections of its directors and other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders 
mr 
crane s ownership of the company s common stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company 
the company could incur additional expenses or taxes if the independent owner operators it uses in connection with its local pickup and delivery operations are found to be employees rather than independent contractors the internal revenue service  state authorities and other third parties have at times successfully asserted that independent owner operators in the transportation industry  including those of the type the company uses in connection with its local pickup and delivery operations  are employees rather than independent contractors 
although the company believes that the independent owner operators the company uses are not employees  the irs  state authorities or others could challenge this position  and federal and state tax or other applicable laws  or interpretations of applicable laws  could change 
if they do  the company could incur additional employee benefit related expenses and could be liable for additional taxes  penalties and interest for prior periods and additional taxes for future periods 
the company s failure to comply with governmental permit and licensing requirements could result in substantial fines or revocation of its operating authorities the company s operations are subject to various state  local  federal and foreign regulations that in many instances require permits and licenses 
the company s failure to maintain required permits or licenses  or to comply with applicable regulations  could result in substantial fines or revocation of its operating authorities 
provisions of the company s charter and bylaws and of texas law may delay or prevent transactions that would benefit shareholders the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws and texas law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of the company 
these provisions  among other things o authorize the company s board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock  o restrict the ability of shareholders to take action by written consent  and o restrict the company s ability to engage in transactions with shareholders 
because of these provisions  persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with the company s board of directors rather than pursue non negotiated takeover attempts 
as a result  these provisions may make it more difficult for the company s shareholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview during the past two fiscal years  the company s revenues increased at a compound annual rate of to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september   and its operating income increased at a compound annual rate of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal historically  the company has grown primarily through internal expansion  including developing its terminal network  expanding its service offerings and sales force and increasing its customer base 
the company has also made acquisitions on a limited basis and has additional acquisitions pending 
since october   it has added terminals  increasing the total to at september  at that date  seven of these terminals had been open less than months 
the company plans to continue to expand its terminal network 
the company currently plans to open terminals in approximately additional cities by the end of fiscal these plans  however  are subject to change based on a variety of factors 
the company may also complement its internal expansion with selective acquisitions 
the opening of a new terminal generally has an initial short term negative impact on the company s profitability due to the operating losses of the new terminal 
however  the opening of a new terminal generally does not require significant capital expenditures 
additionally  personnel costs are contained at the time of the opening of a new terminal because commissions are generally not paid until salesmen achieve minimum sales levels and until managers achieve terminal profitability 
although future new terminals may be opened in cities smaller than those in which the company s more mature terminals are located  the company believes the results of new terminals should benefit from a ready base of business provided by its existing customers 
the company intends to continue to expand its international freight forwarding business 
international shipments typically generate higher gross revenues and net revenue per shipment than domestic shipments 
however  costs of transportation as a percentage of revenues are typically higher for international freight than for domestic freight 
the company does not expect its operating expenses to increase in proportion to increased international revenues 
in april  the company expanded its international operations through the acquisition of the operations of eagle transfer  inc and of s 
boardman air services limited 
additionally  the company commenced operations in hong kong during september and in argentina  brazil and peru during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company also intends to continue the growth of its local pickup and delivery operations 
by providing local pickup and delivery services for the company s freight forwarding shipments  the company has been able to increase its net revenue margin with respect to these shipments because it captures margins which were previously paid to third parties 
however  the company s local pickup and delivery services provided to other  non forwarding customers generate a lower net revenue margin than the company s domestic forwarding operations due to their higher transportation costs as a percentage of revenues

the amounts described above to be paid pursuant to this acquisition are current approximate equivalents of required payments in canadian dollars 
exchange rate fluctuations could cause the final amounts paid to change 
year issues historically  some computer programs used only the last two digits of a year to refer to a date  causing them to not properly recognize a year that does not begin with this could result in major failures or miscalculations and is generally referred to as the year or yk problem 
the company relies principally on three internal systems to support its freight forwarding  pickup and delivery  logistics management  accounting and management reporting worldwide 
the company s assessment of these systems is as follows o the primary domestic forwarding  logistics management  accounting and management system has been independently tested and the company has received a year compliance certificate 
the cost of this testing was not significant and only minor remediation was requested 
o the primary international forwarding system has been developed in house using current technology and a platform that has been certified as yk compliant 
o the company has upgraded the pickup and delivery system for a minimal cost 
the company has not identified any internal non information technology systems that use embedded technology on which it relies and that it believes is likely to have a yk problem 
except as noted above  the company has completed its review and remediation of its internal systems for potential year problems it has identified 
however  the company plans to continue to monitor these systems through the end of and into the year the company is also reliant on systems capabilities of business partners  trading partners  customers  suppliers  governmental agencies and internet and telecommunications providers in many countries throughout the world 
like every other business enterprise  the company is at risk from year failures in public and private infrastructure services  including electricity  water  gas  transportation and communications 
other than telecommunications services and electronic data interchange  the company does not directly rely on the systems capabilities of third parties for its principal operations 
because of the company s extensive use of technology  it is dependent on data and voice communications to receive  process  track and bill customer orders 
the company has completed tests of electronics data interchange with several of its trading partners and plans additional tests through the end of the company has also received representations as to year compliance from a majority of its major suppliers and plans to continue to monitor the status of its suppliers compliance efforts through the end of the company is also vulnerable to noncompliance of third party systems if they result in business interruption of a customer 
the company is currently addressing readiness issues with some of its major customers 
because of the number of external risks involved  the company believes there is likely to be some disruption in its business as a result of noncompliance by third parties 
of all the external risks  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be a business disruption resulting from an extended communications failure and or an extended failure of the air traffic systems in the united states and other countries 
in addition  the global transportation industry and regulatory authorities  including the united states department of transportation and related agencies  could be affected in a way that negatively affects the company s operations 
the company s transportation providers might be unable to provide those services because of these year failures or year problems of their own 
if a year failure causes insufficient air lift to be available to it  the company s air freight forwarding operations would be curtailed and the company might also be unable to provide sufficient alternative services such as ground  rail or ocean cargo capacity to meet expected levels of operations 
furthermore  should the company s customers experience business interruption in the year  its results of operation could be materially adversely affected 
the company would also likely experience a deterioration in collections if its customers experience year failures 
based on the company s information regarding the readiness of suppliers  including air carriers and communication carriers  and customers  the company expects that any year disruption would be of short duration 
however  the company is unable to determine the potential business interruption costs that might be incurred as a result of yk disruptions 
the company has formulated contingency plans in the event of possible business interruptions 
the company continues to address emergency instructions  including security  power outages and telecommunications failures  and alternative means of transporting freight for each of its terminals 
the company expects that its contingency planning will continue to the end of and the beginning of to date  the company has incurred less than  of expense and does not currently plan to expend any material amount of funds for yk remediation 
despite its assessment to date  the company cannot give assurance as to the ultimate effect that the yk issues will have on its business 
the company s assessment of its year issues involves many assumptions 
the company s assumptions might prove to be inaccurate  and actual results could differ significantly from the assumptions 
in addition  third party representations or certifications as to year compliance might prove to be inaccurate and year compliance tests may not have been subjected to a sufficient sample of conditions 
the company could be adversely affected by business disruptions of a greater magnitude than anticipated or from a failure of its contingency plans to adequately address problems 
seasonality historically  the company s operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
the second fiscal quarter  ending march  has traditionally been the weakest  and the fourth fiscal quarter  ending september  has traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern is the result of  or is influenced by  numerous factors  including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the company s terminal network 
the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor 
as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounts standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for transactions entered into after january  sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings of other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and the type of hedge transaction 
the ineffective portion of all hedges will be recognized in earnings 
the company is in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on its results of operations and financial position 
in october  the company adopted sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
under sfas  companies are required to report in their financial statements  in addition to net income  comprehensive income including  as applicable o foreign currency items  o minimum pension liability adjustments  and o unrealized gains and losses on selected investments in debt and equity securities 
the company s only component of other comprehensive income is foreign currency translation adjustments 
cumulative translation adjustments are now characterized as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
sfas requires that companies report separately  in their financial statements  financial and descriptive information about operating segments  if applicable 
adoption of sfas and sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
during the year ended september   the company s geographic segments which are outside the united states did not represent  in the aggregate  more than of the revenues  net income or assets of the combined amounts for all geographic segments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   the company did not have any outstanding short term or long term debt instruments 
accordingly  the company does not have market risk related to interest rates 
however  the company s lease payments on some financed facilities are tied to market interest rates 
at september   a rise in the base rate for these financing arrangements would not have a material impact on operating income for fiscal the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as it relates to the earnings of its united kingdom  canada  mexico  hong kong and latin america operations  as a result of transactions in foreign markets 
at september   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which these operations are denominated would not have a material impact on operating income for fiscal the company has not purchased any futures contracts  nor has it purchased or held any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company entered into contracts for the purpose of hedging the cost of a portion of anticipated jet fuel purchases during the following months 
these contracts are nominally insignificant 
at september   a change in the price of jet fuel would not have a material impact on operating income for fiscal
