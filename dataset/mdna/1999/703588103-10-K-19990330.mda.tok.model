year considerations the following is a year readiness disclosure statement 
overview 
the company s year project the project is steadily proceeding 
the project involves resolving the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive information by the company s internal computer systems and equipment and by the computer systems and equipment utilized by third parties with whom the company maintains material relationships 
the company believes that it has identified substantially all of its own information technology systems it systems and non information technology embedded technology systems non it systems which require modification in order to become year compliant 
in addition  the company believes that it has identified those third parties whose inability to handle date sensitive processing could materially and adversely impact the company if corrective action is not taken in a timely manner 
the company has identified five major internal it systems which require attention as part of the project general ledger gl  agency operations agency  underwriting  which includes policy issuance  maintenance of policy records  billing and auditing underwriting  claims adjudication claims and third party administration  which includes life insurance and accident and health insurance policy issuance  maintenance and billing operations tpa 
the company s approach to each of these systems differs based on the company s use of the system and whether the system was purchased from a third party or developed in house 
gl system 
the company has completed in house construction and testing of a new gl system which is year compliant 
agency system 
the company has completed the process of out sourcing its agency system needs to james g 
parker insurance associates parker  one of the founders of the paula trading company 
parker utilizes an agency software system provided by a third party vendor which is year compliant according to a written statement received from the vendor 
underwriting system 
the company s in house underwriting system is not yet fully year compliant 
the company has therefore chosen to make its existing underwriting system year compliant using a technique known as windowing  which is a solution that will work for many years  but not permanently 
windowing is faster and requires less testing than permanent solutions 
the company believes permanent solutions are not necessary in light of the new system under development 
the company has purchased a software tool to perform the windowing project and has retained several consultants familiar with the software tool to perform the project 
the consultants will work under the supervision of the company s information services staff 
the company has identified the programs to be modified  prioritized those programs based on their earliest expected date of failure and has begun using the software tool to perform the correction to the programs 
the company has prepared a testing environment to perform the corrective procedures and to test the results in a realistic data environment 
although the windowing project is proceeding more slowly than anticipated  the company expects the windowing project  involving correction and testing of all necessary underwriting system programs  to be completed during the end of the second quarter of this represents a delay of approximately days from the company s prior disclosures 
the company is currently constructing a new in house underwriting system that will be year compliant  but this new system is not expected to address the company s year issues in a timely fashion 
claims system 
the company s claims system is licensed from a third party vendor 
the claims system uses two distinct products  one for claims telephonic reporting and one for claims adjudication 
the company has added custom features to the standard version of each of the products provided by the vendor 
the company s current version of these two system products are not year compliant 
the company has received delivery of a standard upgrade to its claims adjudication system which is year compliant  according to the vendor  which is currently being tested by the company 
the company and the vendor have identified customized features which must be added to the upgraded claims adjudication system and the vendor has agreed to perform the customization 
the company expects the customization to be completed during june and final installation  testing and training to be complete by early in the third quarter of this represents a delay of approximately days from the company s prior disclosures 
the company has determined that it cannot modify the programs of the existing version of the claims system to make it year compliant 
however  the company does not believe that continuing to utilize the non year compliant version of the claims adjudication system through the third quarter of will materially impair operations 
the company expects to implement the customized upgrade early during the third quarter 
if necessary  the company will commence using the standard version of the claims system upgrade it has already received and installed 
the company s claims telephonic reporting system will not be made year compliant by the vendor 
as scheduled  the company has modified its claims telephonic reporting system to properly process claims during  but this modification will not allow claims processing in the company has chosen to move to a vendor maintained  year compliant  mainframe based telephonic reporting system 
this is expected to be effective during the middle of the second quarter of  a delay of approximately days from the company s prior disclosures 
tpa system 
the company has licensed a third party claims administration software product that the company uses for all tpa functions 
the company has received from the vendor a year upgrade to the version used by the company which will be installed and tested by the end of the first quarter  on schedule 
non it systems 
the company has addressed its primary year issues relating to non it systems by purchasing a new ibm mainframe computer to run its it systems 
the company intends to purchase a new second mainframe from ibm to extend the company s computing capacity during the second quarter of at that time  the company s old ibm mainframe will be relegated to a back up role 
the company has obtained satisfactory evidence that the operating system of the company s new mainframe computers are year compliant from ibm s internet website 
the company is continuing to inventory its other non it systems as part of the project 
these systems include the company s personal computer network  telephone switching equipment and other office equipment 
once these systems are inventoried  the company will prioritize the impact of their failure due to year issues and then begin testing and correcting to bring them into year compliance 
the company expects the inventory and prioritization phases to be completed by the end of the first quarter of and corrective action to be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company does not believe that it is materially exposed to any company specific non it system year issues other than those addressed by purchasing new mainframe computers due to the nature of the company s business 
the company has no material property  plant or equipment 
third party year issues 
the company has made good progress in obtaining year compliance assurances from third parties with whom the company has material trading arrangements  or upon whom the company relies to a material extent in its normal operations 
the company will continue working to satisfy itself that each third party performing important functions for the company has taken necessary measures to ensure that their it and non it systems will be year compliant in a timely manner 
the company believes it will suffer no material disruption of its operations from its trading partners year issues 
the company has not  and will not  attempt to assess the year compliance of regulatory authorities  statistical rating bureaus or public utilities as the company cannot cause such entities to increase their efforts to become year compliant 
costs 
the total cost associated with required program modifications  software upgrades and equipment purchases to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s total budget for its year compliance program  which began in  is  this estimate does not include the company s potential share of year costs that may be incurred by the company s trading partners which the company may choose to bear to increase the likelihood of their timely year compliance 
of the total budget amount   was spent in   was spent in  and  will be spent during the costs associated with the company s new underwriting system are not included in the year budget 
the company is utilizing cash flow from operations to fund its year budget needs 
contingencies 
the company continues to review its alternatives in the event that it is not able to complete its year compliance plans in a timely manner 
these alternatives include  without limitation  purchasing third party insurance company software packages  acceleration of the construction of the company s new underwriting system and outsourcing the non compliant company functions to third parties 
each of these alternatives is less advantageous to the company than its current year compliance plan and  if required  could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risks 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of regulatory authorities  statistical rating bureaus and public utilities  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the company believes the project will significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
consultants 
the company has not used the services of independent year consultants to assess its it system and non it system needs  although the company is utilizing the services of independent consultants in its underwriting system windowing project and in constructing its new underwriting system 
the company continues to review its year program with its outside auditors on a regular basis

these uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks 
due to the company s significant level of investments in fixed maturity securities bonds  interest rate risk represents the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position  although the company also has limited exposure to equity price risk 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the company s financial activities as of december  caution should be used in evaluating the company s overall market risk from the information below  since actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions used below and because unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are not included in the hypothetical effects of changes in market conditions discussed below 
as of december  unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represent of the company s total liabilities and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents of the company s total assets 
interest rate risk the company employees a conservative investment strategy emphasizing asset quality and the matching of maturities of its fixed maturity investments to the company s anticipated claim payments  expenditures and other liabilities 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio includes investments in cmo s which are exposed to accelerated prepayment risk generally caused by interest rate movements 
as of december   the company s fixed maturity portfolio represented of the company s total assets and of the company s invested assets 
management intends to hold all of the company s fixed maturity investments for indefinite periods of time but these investments are available for sale in response to changes in interest rates  tax planning considerations or other aspects of asset liability management 
the company does not utilize stand alone derivatives to manage interest rate risks 
the company has historically utilized a moderate level of corporate borrowings and debt 
the company strives to maintain the highest credit ratings so that the cost of debt is minimized 
as of december   notes payable and notes payable to bank account for of total liabilities 
the company s fixed maturity investments  including cmos  notes payable and notes payable to bank are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  cmo prepayment rates  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the table below summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
the hypothetical fair values are based upon the same prepayment assumptions utilized in computing fair values as of december  should interest rates decline  mortgage holders are more likely to refinance existing mortgages at lower rates 
acceleration of repayments could adversely affect future investment income  if reinvestment of the cash received from repayments is in lower yielding securities 
such changes in prepayment rates are not taken into account in the following disclosures 
interest rate risk in thousands hypothetical estimated fair percentage value after increase hypothetical change in hypothetical decrease in fair value at interest rate change in stockholders december  bp basis pts

equity price risk the company generally does not invest in equity securities for trading purposes 
as of december   equity securities represent of the company s total assets 
the carrying values of publicly traded investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of the investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative prices of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the carrying values of privately held investments are subject to equity price risks which are based on the foregoing market price considerations and also on the underlying value of the issuer and other buyer s perceptions of such value  as well as lack of liquidity considerations 
the table below summarizes the company s equity price risks as of december  and shows the effects of a hypothetical increase and decrease in the market prices as of december  the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios 
equity price risk in thousands hypothetical percentage estimated fair increase value after decrease in fair value at hypothetical price hypothetical stockholders december  change price change equity preferred stock  increase  decrease common stock  increase  decrease
