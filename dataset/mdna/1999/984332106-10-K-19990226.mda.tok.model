advertising revenues on both banner and sponsorship contracts are recognized ratably over the period in which the advertisement is displayed  provided that no significant company obligations remain at the end of a period and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
company obligations typically include guarantees of minimum number of impressions  or times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the company s online properties 
to the extent minimum guaranteed impressions are not met  the company defers recognition of the corresponding revenues until the remaining guaranteed impression levels are achieved 
the company also earns revenue on sponsorship contracts from fees relating to the design  coordination  and integration of customers content and links into yahoo online media properties 
these development fees are recognized as revenue once the related activities have been performed and the customer s web links are available on yahoo online media properties 
a number of the company s agreements provide that yahoo receive revenues from electronic commerce transactions

the company currently has no material commitments other than those under operating lease agreements 
the company has experienced a substantial increase in its capital expenditures and operating lease arrangements since its inception  which is consistent with increased staffing  and anticipates that this will continue in the future 
additionally  the company will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products  and technologies that are complementary to those of the company  which may require the use of cash 
management believes existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet the company s operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  however  the company may sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities to further enhance its liquidity position 
the sale of additional securities could result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders 
year implications many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field and cannot distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
these date code fields will need to distinguish st century dates from th century dates and  as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
the company is in the process of assessing the year issue and expects to complete the program by the spring of the company has not incurred material costs to date in this process  and currently does not believe that the cost of additional actions will have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
although yahoo currently believes that its systems are year compliant in all material respects  the current systems and products may contain undetected errors or defects with year date functions that may result in material costs 
although yahoo is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  the company may experience serious unanticipated negative consequences such as significant downtime for one or more yahoo media properties or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems 
in addition  the company utilizes third party equipment  software and content  including non information technology systems non it systems  such as its security system  building equipment  and non it systems embedded microcontrollers that may not be year compliant 
the company is in the process of developing a plan to assess whether these third parties are adequately addressing the year issue and whether any of its non it systems have material year compliance problems 
failure of such third party equipment  software  or content to operate properly with regard to the year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  and financial condition 
yahoo is in the process of fully developing a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if it is unable to achieve year readiness of its critical operations 
finally  the company is also subject to external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as utility or transportation company year compliance failures and related service interruptions 
furthermore  the purchasing patterns of advertisers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct their current systems for year compliance 
the company does not currently have any information about the year status of its advertising customers 
however  these expenditures may result in reduced funds available for web advertising or sponsorship of web services  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations  and change in the market values of its investments 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues from the company s foreign subsidiaries were less than of total revenues 
international sales are made mostly from the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to the company s foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company in was not material 
investment risk 
the company invests in equity instruments of privately held  information technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than 
for these non quoted investments  the company s policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
the company identifies and records impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
to date  no such impairment has been recorded 
during  certain of these investments in privately held companies became marketable equity securities when the investees completed initial public offerings 
such investments  which are in the internet industry  are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to the volatility of the stock market  and are recorded as long term investments
