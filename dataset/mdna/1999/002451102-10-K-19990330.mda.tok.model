item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis md a for the equitable which follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this report 
combined operating results in  in accordance with sfas no 
 management identified three operating segments that reflect the equitable s major businesses insurance  investment banking and asset management 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
this md a presents pre tax operating results and segment information on a basis which adjusts amounts as reported in the gaap financial statements to exclude the effect of unusual or non recurring events and transactions as well as certain revenue and expense categories management views as not related to the base operations of the particular business 
management believes this presentation produces informative data on the operating trends in each business 
a reconciliation of pre tax operating earnings  as adjusted  to gaap reported earnings from continuing operations precedes each discussion 
a discussion of significant adjustments begins on the next page 
the following table presents the combined operating results of operations outside of the closed block combined on a line by line basis with the closed block s operating results 
the insurance analysis  which begins on page  likewise combines the closed block amounts on a line by line basis 
the md a addresses the combined results of operations unless noted otherwise 
the investment banking and asset management discussions begin on pages and  respectively

in all three years  investment gains losses  net of dac and other charges incorporate insurance segment investment gains losses including the losses associated with the accelerated real estate sales program see page 
these investment gain loss adjustments also included gains losses in each of the three years related to the exercise of options  the conversion of restricted stock units and other issuances of alliance units or dlj stock 
no adjustments are made for dlj s trading and other investment gains which remain in operating earnings 
pre tax adjustments for include the gain on the ere sale and the writedown of cursitor related intangible assets 
adjustments for both and include restructuring costs in connection with cost reduction programs  there were no such costs in the operating results excluded reserve strengthenings related to the di and pension par lines of business totaling million as described on page during fourth quarter  the equitable released approximately million of tax reserves related to continuing operations for years prior to the effect is included in federal income taxes for see discontinued operations for a discussion of significant actions which affected discontinued operations results in and continuing operations compared to the higher pre tax operating earnings for reflected increased earnings by the insurance and asset management segments and lower earnings for investment banking principally due to the impact of adverse capital market conditions on dlj in third quarter federal income taxes increased due to the higher pre tax results of operations  the tax reserve release and the federal tax on partnership gross income from the active conduct of a trade or business which was imposed on certain publicly traded limited partnerships  including alliance  effective january  minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiaries was higher principally due to increased earnings at alliance and to reductions in the equitable s ownership percentages in dlj and alliance to and at december  from and at december   respectively 
the billion increase in revenues for compared to was attributed primarily to the billion increase in commissions  fees and other income principally due to increased business activity within investment banking and asset management 
net investment income increased million for with increases of million and million for investment banking and asset management  respectively  offset by a million decrease for insurance 
investment gains decreased by million for principally due to million lower gains in investment banking 
for  total benefits and other deductions increased million from  reflecting increases in other operating costs and expenses of million and a million increase in policyholders benefits partially offset by a million decrease in interest credited to policyholders 
the increase in other operating costs and expenses principally resulted from increased operating costs of million in investment banking 
compared to compared to  the higher pre tax operating earnings for reflected increased earnings for the investment banking and insurance segments  partially offset by lower earnings for asset management principally due to the sale of ere in june the billion increase in revenues for compared to was attributed primarily to a million increase in investment income and to a million increase in commissions  fees and other income principally due to increased business activity within investment banking and asset management 
investment gains decreased by million in as lower dealer and trading gains of million at dlj were offset by higher gains of million on other equity investments at dlj 
for  total benefits and other deductions increased billion from  reflecting increases in other operating costs and expenses of billion  offset by a million decrease in policyholders benefits and a million decrease in interest credited to policyholders 
the increase in other operating costs and expenses was primarily attributable to increased costs of million in investment banking and million in insurance primarily due to increased business in both segments and higher dac reactivity to higher gross margins

the following table combines the closed block amounts with the operating results of operations outside of the closed block on a line by line basis insurance combined operating results in millions insurance closed operations block combined combined combined operating results universal life and investment type product policy fee income   premiums    net investment income     commissions  fees and other income contribution from the closed block total revenues      interest credited to policyholders account balances     policyholders benefits      deferred policy acquisition costs all other operating costs and expenses     total benefits and other deductions      pre tax operating earnings pre tax adjustments investment gains losses  net of dac and other charges reserve strengthening restructuring charges total pre tax adjustments gaap reported earnings loss from continuing operations before federal income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change compared to insurance operating earnings for reflected an increase of million from the prior year 
total revenues increased by million primarily due to a million increase in policy fees and a million increase in commissions  fees and other income  offset by a million decrease in investment income and a million decline in premiums 
policy fee income for increased to billion in due to higher insurance and annuity account balances 
the decrease in investment income primarily was due to million lower income on general account investment assets and a million decrease in interest income on loans to discontinued operations in the decrease in premiums during principally was due to lower traditional life and individual health premiums 
total benefits and other deductions for declined million from a million decrease in interest credited on policyholders account balances resulted from moderately lower crediting rates on slightly lower general account balances which more than offset the decline in net investment income 
the decline in policyholders account balances was primarily due to the single large company owned life insurance coli policy surrendered in the first quarter of dac capitalization increased by million primarily related to increased sales volume and dac amortization was million lower due principally to reactivity to mortality  general account investment spread and fee income 
there were million higher commission expenses due to increased sales  partially offset by a million decrease in other general operating costs principally related to lower interest expense 
the million increase in policyholders benefits primarily resulted from higher death claims experience on a higher in force book of business 
compared to operating earnings for reflected an increase of million from the prior year 
higher net investment income  higher policy fees on variable and interest sensitive life and individual annuities contracts  higher dac capitalization and lower life insurance mortality were partially offset by higher policy acquisition costs 
they also reflect improved di and group pension results after the establishment of premium deficiency reserves and the writeoff of dac in fourth quarter total revenues increased by million primarily due to the investment income increase of million  a million increase in policy fees and a million increase in commissions  fees and other income partially offset by a million decline in premiums 
the increase in investment income principally was due to higher overall yields on a larger general account investment asset base totaling million  offset by a million decrease in interest received on lower intersegment borrowings by discontinued operations 
the decrease in premiums principally was due to lower traditional life and individual health premiums 
the million increase in policy fee income was due to higher insurance and annuity account balances 
total benefits and other deductions for increased million from as an increase of million in other operating expenses and million higher dac amortization were partially offset by a million decrease in policy benefits and million higher dac capitalization 
the increase in other operating expenses resulted from higher commissions and variable expenses related to increased sales  higher costs related to the annuity wholesale distribution channel introduced in the latter part of and higher costs associated with litigation 
the sales related expense increases were substantially offset by higher dac capitalization 
the net decrease in policyholders benefits primarily resulted from a lower increase in reserves on di business and improved mortality experience on the larger in force book of business for variable and interest sensitive life policies 
this lower mortality experience and higher investment spreads resulted in an increase in the amortization of dac on variable and interest sensitive life policies 
disability income and group pension products during the competitive market conditions of the s  equitable life issued a large amount of noncancelable individual di policies with policy terms and underwriting criteria that were competitive at the time but are more liberal than those available today 
these policies have fixed premiums and are not cancelable as long as premiums are paid 
the majority of the di policies issued before provide for lifetime benefits and many include cost of living riders and provide benefits which exceed  per month  while defining disability as the insured s inability to perform his or her own occupation 
equitable life also had assumed reinsurance on a block of di policies with characteristics similar to its own pre policies 
during the years through  di providers  including equitable life  experienced claims incidence rates higher than previous industry experience 
the equitable had recognized pre tax losses from operations of million and million in and  respectively  for the di line of business before the fourth quarter reserve strengthening 
in light of unfavorable results  in late a loss recognition study of the di business was completed 
the study indicated the dac was not recoverable and the reserves were not sufficient 
therefore  million of unamortized dac on di policies at december  was written off and reserves for directly written di policies and di reinsurance assumed were strengthened by million 
equitable life had issued pension par products designed to provide participating annuity guarantees and benefit payment services to corporate sponsored pension plans  but has made no new sales of these products in several years 
the group pension business produced pre tax losses of million and million in and  respectively  before the fourth quarter reserve strengthening 
during fourth quarter  a loss recognition study was completed which prompted management to establish a pension par premium deficiency reserve  resulting in a million pre tax charge to the results of continuing operations at december   principally attributable to improved mortality assumptions 
based on the experience that emerged on these two books of business during and  management continues to believe the assumptions and estimates used to develop the di and pension par reserve strengthenings are reasonable 
the determination of reserves requires making assumptions and estimates covering a number of factors  including mortality  morbidity and interest rates  claims experience and lapse rates based on then known facts and circumstances 
such factors as claims incidence and termination rates can be affected by changes in the economic  legal and regulatory environments  as well as societal factors eg work ethic 
while management believes the di and pension par reserves have been calculated on a reasonable basis and are adequate  there can be no assurance that they will be sufficient to provide for all future liabilities 
from july  through january  new disability income policies issued by equitable life were reinsured through an arrangement with paul revere life insurance company paul revere 
beginning february  equisource  inc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of equitable life  entered into an agreement that permits equitable life s career agency force to offer di policies of provident life and accident insurance company provident and equitable life stopped underwriting new di policies 
as a result of a acquisition  paul revere and provident are now affiliates  and they manage claims incurred under equitable life s di policies 
equitable life is reviewing the claims management agreement and is exploring its ability to dispose of the di business through reinsurance

first year premiums and deposits for individual insurance and annuity products for increased from prior year s level by billion primarily due to higher sales of individual annuities 
renewal premiums and deposits increased by million during over as increases in the larger block of individual annuities and variable and interest sensitive life policies were partially offset by decreases in the traditional life product line 
the increase in first year individual annuities premiums and deposits in over the prior year included a billion increase in sales of a line of retirement annuity products sold through expanded wholesale distribution channels over the million sold through that distribution channel in compared with  sales of individual annuities by the career agency force rose to billion in first year premiums and deposits for individual insurance and annuity products in increased from prior year levels by billion due to higher sales of individual annuities and variable and interest sensitive life products 
renewal premiums and deposits for individual insurance and annuity products increased by million during over as increases in the larger block of variable and interest sensitive life and individual annuity policies were partially offset by decreases in traditional life policies 
the increase in first year individual annuities premiums and deposits in over included million from a line of retirement annuity products sold through wholesale distribution channels 
first year individual life premiums and deposits for included million of premiums and deposits from the sale of two large coli cases 
sales of mutual funds and other investments by the career agency force totaled billion in  up from billion in and billion in surrenders and withdrawals the following table presents surrenders and withdrawals  including universal life and investment type contract withdrawals  for major individual insurance and annuity product lines 
surrenders and withdrawals in millions individual insurance and annuity product lines individual annuities    variable and interest sensitive life  traditional life total    surrendered traditional and variable and interest sensitive life insurance policies represented  and of average surrenderable future policy benefits and policyholders account balances for such life insurance contracts in force during  and  respectively 
surrendered individual annuity contracts represented  and of average surrenderable policyholders account balances for individual annuity contracts in force during those same years  respectively 
policy and contract surrenders and withdrawals increased million during compared to principally due to the first quarter surrender of million related to a single large coli contract 
since there were outstanding policy loans on the surrendered contract  there were no cash outflows 
excluding the effect of this one surrender  the remaining million increase resulted from higher surrenders and withdrawals in the larger book of individual annuities and variable and interest sensitive life policies 
policy and contract surrenders and withdrawals increased million during compared to the million increase in individual annuities surrenders was principally due to increased surrenders of equi vest contracts as favorable market performance increased account values  consequently increasing surrender amounts with no significant increase in actual surrender rates 
the persistency of life insurance and annuity products is a critical element of their profitability 
as of december   all in force individual life insurance policies other than individual life term policies without cash values which comprise of in force policies and approximately of individual annuity contracts as measured by reserves were surrenderable 
however  a surrender charge often applies in the early contract years and declines to zero over time 
contracts without surrender provisions cannot be terminated prior to maturity 
margins on individual insurance and annuity products insurance results significantly depend on profit margins between investment results from general account investment assets and interest credited on individual insurance and annuity products 
during  margins widened as lower average crediting rates more than offset lower investment yields 
during  the crediting rate ranges were to for variable and interest sensitive life insurance  to for variable deferred annuities  to for spda contracts  and to for retirement investment accounts 
margins on individual insurance and annuity products are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
rising interest rates result in a decline in the market value of assets 
however  the positive cash flows from renewal premiums and payments of principal and interest on existing assets would make an early disposition of investment assets to meet operating cash flow requirements unlikely 
rising interest rates also would result in available cash flows from maturities being invested at higher interest rates  which would help support a gradual increase in new business and renewal interest rates on interest sensitive products 
a sharp  sudden rise in the interest rate environment without a concurrent increase in crediting rates could result in higher surrenders  particularly for annuities 
the effect of such surrenders would be to reduce earnings modestly over the long term while increasing earnings in the period of the surrenders to the extent surrender charges were applicable 
to protect against sharp increases in interest rates  equitable life maintains an interest rate cap program designed to hedge crediting rate increases on interest sensitive individual annuity contracts 
at december   the notional amounts of contracts outstanding totaled billion  as compared to billion at december  if interest rates fall  crediting interest rates and dividends would be adjusted subject to competitive pressures 
only a minority of this segment s policies and contracts have fixed interest rates locked in at issue 
the majority of contracts are adjustable  having guaranteed minimum rates ranging from approximately to 
approximately of the life policies have a minimum rate of or lower 
should interest rates fall below such policy minimums  adjustments to life policies mortality and expense charges could cover the shortfall in most situations 
lower crediting interest rates and dividends could result in higher surrenders 
to protect against interest rate decreases  equitable life maintains interest rate floors  at december  and  the outstanding notional amounts of contracts totaled billion in each of the years

revenues increased million due to increases in commissions  underwritings and fee income 
commissions rose to million as a result of increases in dlj s institutional equities business  its private client and on line brokerage service units and its correspondent services business 
underwriting revenues grew to billion as dlj increased its market share in equity  convertible and high yield underwriting 
fee income increased to billion due to increased merger and acquisition activity 
net investment income rose to billion as funds were used to finance us government  agency and mortgage backed securities 
additionally  there were increases in domestic and foreign margin balances and higher levels of foreign fixed income securities  primarily in the emerging markets prior to dlj s withdrawal from that activity in the second half of the dealer and trading loss and the decline in other investment gains losses in are primarily attributable to markdowns on dlj s fixed maturities and to losses incurred in emerging market and high yield fixed maturities trading in the latter half of as global economic problems  particularly in japan and in emerging markets including russia and asia  led to a widespread sell off of these securities worldwide 
total expenses for investment banking increased million in the employee compensation and benefits increase of million resulted from increased incentive and production related compensation due to the business growth described above and to increased headcount as dlj s businesses continued to expand globally 
this expansion also accounted for the million increase in rent  communications and other equipment 
interest expense for rose million 
most of this increase related to the financing of dlj s domestic and foreign stock loan borrowed business 
the million increase in brokerage  clearing and exchange fees resulted from increased share volume and transaction fees

writedowns on fixed maturities primarily related to below investment grade securities aggregated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
writedowns on equity real estate totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in writedowns on fixed maturities was principally due to an increase in problem fixed maturities in the second half of there were no real estate writedowns in the equity real estate writedowns in principally resulted from changes in assumptions related to real estate holding periods and property cash flows

the equitable does not accrue interest income on problem fixed maturities unless management believes the full collection of principal and interest is probable 
interest not accrued on problem fixed maturity investments totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the amortized cost of wholly or partially non accruing problem fixed maturities was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
based on its monitoring of fixed maturities  management identifies a class of potential problem fixed maturities  which consists of fixed maturities not currently classified as problems but for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured 
the decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer

mortgages 
at december   the mortgage portfolio included commercial billion  agricultural billion and residential loans million

the equitable categorizes mortgages days or more past due  as well as mortgages in the process of foreclosure  as problem commercial mortgages 
based on its monthly monitoring of commercial mortgages  management identifies a class of potential problem mortgages  which consists of mortgage loans not currently classified as problems but for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms and which may result in the loan becoming a problem or being restructured 
the decision whether to classify a performing mortgage loan as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the borrower or the individual mortgaged property

equity real estate consists primarily of office  retail  industrial  mixed use and other properties 
office properties constituted the largest component of amortized cost of this portfolio at december  during  the equitable received proceeds from the sale of equity real estate of billion  compared to million in and million in  and recognized gains of million  million and million  respectively 
the carrying value of the equity real estate at date of sale reflected total writedowns and additions to valuation allowances on the properties taken in periods prior to their sale of million  million and million  respectively 
in connection with this sales program  at december   equitable life reclassified billion depreciated cost of continuing and discontinued operations equity real estate from held for production of income to held for sale 
since held for sale properties are carried at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value  less disposition costs  the reclassification generated additions to valuation allowances of million for continuing operations in fourth quarter also  during fourth quarter  the review of the equity real estate portfolio identified properties held for production of income which were impaired  resulting in writedowns of million for continuing operations 
the total pre tax impact of these actions was million net of related dac amortization of million for continuing operations 
in addition  these real estate actions contributed to a million strengthening of discontinued operations allowance for future losses in fourth quarter at december   the remaining held for sale real estate portfolio s depreciated cost for continuing operations totaled billion  excluding related valuation allowances of million 
management establishes valuation allowances on individual properties identified as held for sale with the objective of fully reserving for anticipated shortfalls between depreciated cost and sales proceeds 
on a quarterly basis  the valuation allowances on real estate held for sale are adjusted to reflect changes in market values in relation to depreciated cost 
since the size of the portfolio of properties held for sale was significantly larger at december  and than in prior years due to the equity real estate sales program discussed above  fluctuations in the related valuation allowances prior to actual sale could be larger than those experienced in prior periods 
as the accelerated equity real estate sales program continues into  management expects further reductions to this portfolio will depend on market conditions  the level of mortgage foreclosures and expenditures required to fund necessary or desired improvements to properties 
it is management s policy not to invest substantial new funds in equity real estate except to safeguard values in existing investments or to honor outstanding commitments 
at december   the overall vacancy rate for the equitable s real estate office properties was  with a vacancy rate of for properties acquired as investment real estate and for properties acquired through foreclosure 
the national commercial office vacancy rate was as of september  as measured by cb commercial 
lease rollover rates for office properties for  and range from to 
at december   the equity real estate category included billion depreciated cost of properties acquired as investment real estate or of depreciated cost of equity real estate held and billion amortized cost of properties acquired through foreclosure  including in substance foreclosure 
cumulative writedowns recognized on foreclosed properties were million through december  as of december   the carrying value of the equity real estate portfolio was of its original cost 
the depreciated cost of foreclosed equity real estate totaled million and billion at year end and  respectively 
other equity investments 
other equity investments consist of lbo  mezzanine  venture capital and other limited partnership interests million or of the amortized cost of this portfolio at december   alternative limited partnerships million or and common stock and other equity securities million or 
alternative funds utilize trading strategies that may be leveraged  and attempt to protect against market risk through a variety of methods  including short sales  financial futures  options and other derivative instruments 
other equity investments can create significant volatility in investment income since they predominantly are accounted for in accordance with the equity method which treats increases and decreases in the estimated fair value of the underlying assets or allocable portion thereof  in the case of partnerships  whether realized or unrealized  as investment income or loss to the equitable 
though not reported in general account investment assets  the excess of separate accounts assets over separate accounts liabilities at december  and of million and million  respectively  represented an investment by the general account principally in equity securities 
as demonstrated by the market volatility and negative returns experienced in the later half of  returns on equity investments are very volatile and investment results for any period are not representative of any other period 
commencing in third quarter  in response to a perceived increase in the price volatility of publicly traded equity markets  the equitable began to reduce its holdings of common stock investments 
with the persistence of high price volatility  the equitable now believes that publicly traded common stocks should be actively managed to control risk and generate investment returns 
effective january   the equitable has designated all investments in publicly traded equity securities in the general account and holding company group portfolios as trading securities for the purpose of classification under sfas no 
and all changes in the investments fair value will be reported through earnings 
discontinued operations in  management adopted a plan to discontinue the business of certain pension operations consisting of wind up annuities and gic lines of business and recorded an allowance for future losses based on management s best judgment at that time 
during and  the allowance for future losses was strengthened by million and million  respectively 
the principal factor in the reserve strengthening action was the change in projected cash flows for equity real estate due to management s plan to accelerate the sale of equity real estate 
the primary factors contributing to the strengthening were changes in projected cash flows for mortgages and other equity investments due to lower portfolio balances as the result of higher than anticipated redemptions and repayments in and an increase in assumed mortgage defaults as well as an increase in projected benefit payments due to the expected increase in longevity of wind up annuities beneficiaries 
the equitable s quarterly process for evaluating the allowance for future losses applies the current period s results of discontinued operations against the allowance  re estimates future losses  and adjusts the allowance  if appropriate 
additionally  as part of the equitable s annual planning process which takes place in the fourth quarter of each year  investment and benefit cash flow projections are prepared 
these projections were utilized in the fourth quarter evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for future losses 
there can be no assurance the losses provided for will not differ from the losses ultimately realized 
to the extent actual results or future projections of discontinued operations differ from management s current best estimates underlying the allowance for future losses  the difference would be reflected as earnings or loss from discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of earnings 
in particular  to the extent income  sales proceeds and holding periods for equity real estate differ from management s previous assumptions  periodic adjustments to the allowance are likely to result 
results of operations 
post tax earnings of million were recognized in compared to post tax losses of million in and million in the allowance for future losses totaled million at december  investment income declined million to million in principally due to lower income on other equity investments 
discontinued operations investment income of million was million lower than principally due to a decrease in investment asset base 
net investment gains totaled million in compared to losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the gains in and higher losses in were both attributable to equity real estate 
interest credited and policyholders benefits on wind up annuities and gic contracts were million in  as compared to million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to repayments of amounts due under gic contracts 
the weighted average crediting rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the interest expense on intersegment borrowings by discontinued operations from continuing operations was million in  down from million and million in and  respectively  due to net repayments 
at year end  billion of policyholders liabilities were outstanding  substantially all of which relate to wind up annuities 
during  the million of intersegment borrowings outstanding at december  were repaid 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flow projections 
at december   estimates of annual net cash flows for discontinued operations in and were million and million  respectively 
at december   the projections for and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in estimated net cash flows was principally due to a higher level of assumed cash flows resulting from equity real estate sales 
other material assumptions used in determining these projections included the following no new intersegment loans from continuing operations  future estimated annual investment income yields on the existing portfolio of to in the projection compared to to used in the projection  use of proceeds from equity real estate sales and other maturing investment assets to pay maturing discontinued operations liabilities  with reinvestment of excess funds in  proceeds were also used to repay intersegment borrowings  and mortality experience for wind up annuities based on the group annuity mortality table with projections for mortality improvements 
the reduction of the equity real estate portfolio through the accelerated sales program depends upon market conditions  the level of mortgage foreclosures and expenditures required to fund necessary or desirable improvements to properties 
discontinued operations investment portfolio in  investment results from discontinued operations investment assets totaled million  a million increase from the prior year principally due to investment gains of million as compared to the million of investment losses in the investment losses resulted from the fourth quarter increases in valuation allowances of million and writedowns relating to equity real estate of million 
this increase in investment gains losses was partially offset by a million decrease in investment income in  principally reflecting a decrease of million for other equity investments 
there was a million loss on mortgage loans in compared to the gain of million and gains of million compared to million of losses on equity real estate 
investment income yields increased to from in  principally due to strong returns on equity real estate 
in  investment results from discontinued operations investment assets totaled million  a million decline from due to the million higher investment losses principally resulting from fourth quarter increases in valuation allowances of million and writedowns relating to equity real estate of million and the million lower investment income 
the investment income for reflected decreases of million  million and million for other equity investments  cash and short term investments and equity real estate  respectively  and by lower income on the mortgage loan and fixed maturities portfolios of million and million  respectively 
a million loss on mortgage loans compared to the gain of million and million higher losses on equity real estate and million of losses on other equity investments compared to million of gains in were partially offset by lower investment losses of million for fixed maturities 
investment income yields increased to from in  principally due to strong returns on other equity investments 
investment assets by selected asset category for information on the asset categories and valuation allowances and writedowns  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
mortgages as of december   discontinued operations commercial mortgages totaled million of amortized cost of the category and agricultural loans totaled million 
potential problem commercial mortgages totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  while restructured commercial mortgages aggregated million  million and million  respectively 
for  scheduled amortization payments and prepayments on commercial mortgage loans aggregated million 
for  million of mortgage loan maturity payments were scheduled  of which million were paid as due 
during  approximately million of commercial mortgage principal payments are scheduled  including million of payments at maturity on commercial mortgage balloon loans 
an additional million of principal payments  including million of payments at maturity on commercial mortgage balloon loans  are scheduled from through depending on the condition of the real estate market and lending practices in future years  many maturing loans may have to be refinanced  restructured or foreclosed upon 
equity real estate during  and  discontinued operations received proceeds from the sale of equity real estate of million  million and million  respectively  and recognized gains of million  million and million  respectively 
these gains reflected total writedowns and additions to valuation allowances on properties sold of million  million and million  respectively  at date of sale 
the depreciated cost of discontinued operations equity real estate properties held for sale at december  was million for which allowances of million have been established 
other equity investments at december   discontinued operations other equity investments of million consisted primarily of limited partnership interests managed by third parties that invest in a selection of equity and fixed income securities million or of amortized cost of this portfolio at that date 
discontinued operations other equity investments also included common stocks acquired in connection with limited partnership investments  as well as other equity investments million or 
returns on other equity investments have been very volatile and investment results for any period are not representative of any other period 
total investment results on other equity investments were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these investment results reflected yields of  and  for  and  respectively 
year equitable life  dlj and alliance continue their year compliance efforts  related costs are being funded by operating cash flows with costs being expensed as incurred 
equitable life equitable life began addressing the year issue in in addition to significant internal resources  third parties have been assisting in renovating and testing computer hardware and software computer systems and embedded systems and in overall project control 
the following process has been undertaken equitable life established a year project office  which developed a strategic approach and created broad awareness of the year issues at equitable life through meetings with the audit committee of the board of directors and executive and senior management  presentations to business areas and employee newsletters 
corporate developed computer systems were inventoried and assessed for year compliance 
third party providers of computer systems and services  including embedded systems  were contacted 
of the who have responded  approximately indicated their systems or services are year compliant  approximately have indicated that they will be compliant  and will be replaced or the function will be eliminated 
those who have not responded will be replaced or the function will be eliminated if no response is received by june  the renovation or replacement of mission critical corporate developed computer systems was substantially completed by year end and management expects the work of renovating or replacing all non compliant corporate developed systems to be substantially completed by june  after renovation or replacement  the systems are then subjected to year compliance testing as described in the following paragraph 
management continues to monitor year compliance by third party providers of computer systems  including embedded systems  and services 
management believes it is on schedule for substantially all such systems and services  including those considered mission critical  to be confirmed as year compliant  renovated  replaced or the subject of contingency plans  by the end of second quarter  except for one investment accounting system which is scheduled to be replaced by the end of august and confirmed as year compliant by september  year compliance testing is an ongoing three part process after a system has been renovated  it is tested to determine if it still performs its intended business function correctly  next  it undergoes a simulation test using dates occurring after december   last  integrated systems tests are conducted to verify that the systems continue to work together with the computers internal clocks set to post december  dates 
management plans to complete the first two phases of testing by june  integrated systems testing will continue throughout as needed 
to date  the testing process has revealed performance issues related to equitable life s replacement general ledger system  which management believes will be resolved on a timely basis 
all significant automated data interfaces with third parties will also be tested for year compliance  including those with lend lease  alliance  the chase manhattan bank  sunguard  pershing and computer science corporation  who provide  among other services  material investment management  accounting  banking  annuity processing and securities clearance services for equitable life s general and certain of its separate accounts 
equitable life has retained third parties to assist with selective verification of the year renovation of certain systems 
existing business continuity and disaster recovery plans cover certain categories of contingencies that could arise as a result of year related failures 
these plans are being supplemented to address contingencies unique to the millennium change 
management anticipates that year specific contingency plans will be developed by the end of second quarter equitable life expects to retain third parties to assist with planning for contingencies 
equitable life s year compliance project is currently estimated to cost million through the end of  of which approximately million was incurred through equitable life s new computer application development and procurement have not been subject to any delay caused in whole or part by year efforts that is expected to have a material adverse effect on the equitable s financial condition or results of operations 
investment subsidiaries dlj and alliance s year related activities and progress to date are summarized below 
for further information  see their respective filings on form k for the year ended december  dlj as a result of dlj s recent business expansion and headquarters move  many of its computer systems are year compliant 
year project plans have been developed and management oversight groups and project managers monitor dlj s decentralized implementation of those plans for its information technology it and non it systems 
at december   these systems had been inventoried and non compliant mission critical systems have been targeted first for remediation 
dlj has retained several major consulting firms with expertise in advising corporations on year issues and their potential impact 
the correspondent clearing business expects to have all non compliant systems renovated  tested and returned to production by march  all other mission critical systems are expected to complete that process by march   followed by non mission critical systems by june  none of dlj s other it projects have been delayed as a result of the year project 
dlj has identified all significant third parties and has received assurances they are taking the necessary steps to prepare for the year additionally  dlj participates in testing sponsored by a securities industry association 
to date  dlj has achieved successful results in each of the tests in which it has participated 
testing of internal and external systems will continue throughout to ensure all remediated systems remain compliant 
dlj currently estimates its year costs will range between million and million  with million incurred through december  while its correspondent clearance business has a formal general contingency plan which covers a variety of events  dlj expects to develop a formal year specific contingency plan by the end of second quarter alliance during  alliance began a formal year initiative  managed by a year project office and focusing on both it and non it systems 
alliance has retained a number of consulting firms with expertise in advising and assisting clients with regard to year issues 
by june   alliance had completed an inventory and assessment of its domestic and international computer systems  identified its mission critical and non mission critical systems  and determined which of these systems were not year compliant 
all third party suppliers of mission critical systems and services have been contacted  substantially all of those contacted have responded 
approximately of the responses indicate their systems are or will be year compliant 
those who have not responded have been contacted a second time 
alliance estimates this process will be completed by march  the same process is being performed for non mission critical systems with an estimated completion date of june  alliance has remediated most of its non compliant mission critical systems and expects the remediation phase for all mission critical systems will be completed by february  with the exception of one portfolio accounting system which will be replaced by a year compliant vendor package by august  remediation of non mission critical systems is expected to be completed by june  alliance has completed the business functionality and the post december  testing for approximately of its mission critical systems and approximately of its non mission critical systems 
full integration testing of all remediated systems and tests of interfaces with third party suppliers will begin in first quarter and continue throughout that year 
alliance is inventorying  evaluating and testing its technical infrastructure and corporate facilities and expects them to be fully operable in the year certain other planned it projects have been deferred until after the year initiative is completed 
such delay is not expected to have a material adverse effect on alliance s financial condition or results of operations 
assisted by a consulting firm  alliance is developing formal year specific contingency plans to address situations where mission critical and non mission critical systems are not remediated as planned by alliance or third parties 
alliance estimates its cost of the year initiative will range between million and million 
such costs consist principally of remediation costs and costs to develop formal year specific contingency plans 
through december   alliance has incurred approximately million of those costs 
risks there are many risks associated with year issues  including the risk that the equitable s computer systems will not operate as intended 
there can be no assurance that the systems  services and products of third parties will be year compliant 
likewise  there can be no assurance the compliance schedules outlined above will be met 
any significant unresolved difficulties related to the year compliance initiatives could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  normal business activities or operations  or the incurrence of unanticipated expenses related to resolving such difficulties  regulatory actions  damage to the equitable s franchise  and legal liabilities and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on the equitable s business operations and financial results 
due to the pervasive nature  the external as well as internal interdependencies and the inherent risk and uncertainties of year issues  the equitable cannot determine which risks are most reasonably likely to occur  if any  nor the effects of any particular failure to be year compliant 
the forward looking statements under year should be read in conjunction with the disclosure set forth under forward looking statements on page to the fullest extent permitted by law  the foregoing year discussion is a year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act  usc sec 

euro currency on january   conversion rates of the national currencies of eleven european union members were fixed against the common currency  called the euro 
each participating country s currency is legal tender during a transition period from january  until january  after which only the euro will be used 
alliance had assessed its internally developed and purchased applications to determine the changes needed to process euro denominated transactions 
the million cost principally related to system modifications was expensed as incurred 
alliance s systems have been changed to process euro denominated transactions 
additional costs associated with the transition period are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the equitable s financial results 
liquidity and capital resources the holding company in april  the holding company completed an offering under its existing shelf registration of million senior notes due and million senior debentures due together the senior debt  resulting in net proceeds of million to be used for general corporate purposes 
pre tax debt service on the senior debt was approximately million in  and will be approximately million per annum thereafter 
under the stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in  the holding company had repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at a cost of million at year end in connection with this repurchase program  during second quarter the holding company privately placed put options entitling the holder to sell up to million shares of common stock to the holding company at specified prices upon exercise of the options 
the equitable had purchased an aggregate of  shares through december    of such options remain outstanding and are exerciseable from time to time during the first half of see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity requirements 
the holding company s cash requirements include debt service  operating expenses  taxes and dividends on its common stock 
pre tax debt service totaled million in  while general and administrative expenses were million 
since  the holding company s board of directors has declared quarterly cash dividends of 
per share on the outstanding shares of its common stock 
during  aggregate cash dividends paid on the holding company s common stock were million 
liquidity sources 
at december   the holding company held cash and short term investments and us treasury securities of approximately million and investment grade publicly traded bonds totaling million 
other primary sources of liquidity for the holding company include i amounts the holding company may receive from its subsidiaries in connection with sect distributions  ii dividends from dlj and iii dividends  distributions or sales proceeds from less liquid investment assets 
the holding company held common stock and less liquid investment assets having an aggregate carrying value of approximately million at december  other potential sources of liquidity for the equitable include sales of dlj common stock held by the holding company  the issuance of additional securities by the holding company and dividends from equitable life 
the assets of the sect the  remaining shares of the series d preferred stock will be distributed over time subject to periodic minimum and maximum requirements to fund various employee compensation and benefit programs of certain of the equitable s subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries will pay the holding company an amount equal to any such distributions 
management expects amounts received by the holding company from its subsidiaries in connection with distributions by the sect will be an additional source of funds 
the aggregate amount available to the holding company from this source will fluctuate over time with changes in the market value of the holding company s common stock 
prior to september   the sect is required to convert a minimum of an amount of series d convertible preferred stock equivalent to approximately  shares of common stock for distribution 
however  the amount of common stock distributed may not exceed a maximum value of approximately million 
dividends on dlj s outstanding common stock paid to the holding company were approximately million in both and certain of dlj s existing credit agreements include dividend covenants but management does not expect these covenants to materially affect the payment of dividends by dlj 
in july  dlj sold an aggregate of million shares of newly issued common stock to the holding company million shares for million  equitable life million shares for million and axa million shares for million 
since the demutualization  the holding company has not received any dividends from equitable life 
under the new york insurance law  equitable life would be permitted to pay shareholder dividends to the holding company only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the superintendent  who by statute has broad discretion in such matters  does not disapprove the distribution 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  equitable life expects to review with the new york insurance department the potential for paying a dividend to the holding company 
management believes the primary sources of liquidity described above are sufficient to meet the holding company s cash requirements for several years 
insurance the principal sources of insurance cash flows are premiums  deposits and charges on policies and contracts  investment income  repayments of principal and proceeds from maturities and sales of general account investment assets and dividends and distributions from subsidiaries 
the insurance liquidity requirements principally relate to the liabilities associated with its various life insurance  annuity and group pension products in its continuing operations  the liabilities of discontinued operations and operating expenses  including debt service 
insurance liabilities include the payment of benefits under life insurance  annuity and group pension products  as well as cash payments in connection with policy surrenders  withdrawals and loans 
management may from time to time explore selective acquisition opportunities in equitable life s core insurance and asset management businesses 
the insurance liquidity requirements are regularly monitored to match cash inflows with cash requirements 
daily cash needs are forecasted and projected sources and uses of funds  as well as the asset  liability  investment and cash flow assumptions underlying these projections  are reviewed periodically 
adjustments are periodically made to the insurance investment policies with respect to  among other things  the maturity and risk characteristics of general account investment assets to reflect changes in the business cash needs and also to reflect the changing competitive and economic environment 
sources of insurance liquidity 
the primary source of short term liquidity to support continuing and discontinued insurance operations is a pool of highly liquid  high quality short term instruments structured to provide liquidity in excess of the expected cash requirements 
at december   this asset pool included an aggregate of billion in highly liquid short term investments  as compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  a substantial portfolio of public bonds including us treasury and agency securities and other investment grade fixed maturities is available to meet the insurance segment s liquidity needs 
other liquidity sources include dividends and distributions from dlj and  particularly alliance 
in  equitable life received cash distributions from alliance of million as compared to million in and million in management believes there is sufficient liquidity in the form of short term assets and its bond portfolio together with cash flows from operations and scheduled maturities of fixed maturities to satisfy insurance s liquidity needs 
in addition  equitable life s commercial paper program has an issue limit of up to million 
this program is available for general corporate purposes to support equitable life s liquidity needs and is supported by equitable life s existing million bank credit facility  which expires in september at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program nor the back up credit facility 
for more information on guarantees  commitments and contingencies  see notes    and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting insurance liquidity 
the insurance group s liquidity needs are affected by fluctuations in the level of surrenders and withdrawals previously discussed in combined operating results by segment insurance surrenders and withdrawals 
management believes the insurance group has adequate internal sources of funds for its presently anticipated needs 
statutory capital 
since  life insurers  including equitable life  have been subject to certain risk based capital rbc guidelines 
the rbc guidelines provide a method to measure the adjusted capital statutory capital and surplus plus the asset valuation reserve avr and other adjustments that a life insurance company should have for regulatory purposes  taking into account the risk characteristics of the company s investments and products 
a life insurance company s rbc ratio depends upon many factors  including its earnings  the mix of assets in its investment portfolio  the nature of the products it sells and its rate of sales growth  as well as changes in the rbc formulas required by regulators 
the rbc guidelines are intended to be a regulatory tool only 
equitable life s rbc ratio has improved in each of the last four years  and management believes that equitable life s statutory capital  as measured by its year end rbc  is adequate to support its current business needs and financial ratings 
on march   members of the naic approved its codification of statutory accounting principles codification project 
codification provides regulators and insurers with uniform statutory guidance  addressing areas where statutory accounting previously was silent and changing certain existing statutory positions 
equitable life will be subject to codification to the extent and in the form adopted in new york state  which would require action by both the new york legislature and the new york insurance department 
it is not possible to predict whether  in what form  or when codification will be adopted in new york  and accordingly it is not possible to predict the effect of codification on equitable life 
at december   million or of the insurance group s aggregate statutory capital and surplus representing of statutory capital and surplus and avr resulted from surplus relief reinsurance 
the level of surplus relief reinsurance was reduced by approximately million in alliance alliance s principal sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations and the issuance  both publicly and privately  of debt and units 
alliance requires financial resources to fund commissions paid on certain back end load mutual fund sales  to fund capital expenditures and for general working capital purposes 
alliance has a million five year revolving credit facility and a million commercial paper program 
combined borrowings under the facility and the commercial paper program may not exceed million 
at december   alliance had million of commercial paper outstanding  there were no amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
dlj dlj reported total assets as of december  of billion 
dlj s assets are highly liquid  including principally securities inventories and collateralized receivables 
such receivables include agreements and securities borrowed  both of which are secured by us government and agency securities  and marketable corporate debt and equity securities 
a relatively small percentage of total assets is fixed or held for a period longer than one year 
a significant portion of dlj s borrowings is matched to the interest rate and expected holding period of the corresponding assets 
dlj monitors overall liquidity by tracking the extent to which unencumbered marketable assets exceed short term unsecured borrowings 
dlj s overall capital needs are continually reviewed to ensure that its capital base can appropriately support the anticipated needs of its businesses and meet the regulatory capital requirements of its subsidiaries 
dlj has been active in raising additional long term financing  including the million of senior notes  million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes  million medium term notes and million senior notes issued in dlj repaid its million senior subordinated revolving credit agreement and terminated the related facility 
in january  dlj issued an initial million shares of fixed adjustable rate cumulative preferred stock  series b  with a liquidation preference of per share million aggregate liquidation value 
also  in january  dlj commenced a billion commercial paper program 
at december   million of notes were outstanding under this program 
dlj historically has satisfied its needs for funds primarily from capital including long term debt  internally generated funds  uncommitted lines of credit  free credit balances in customers accounts  master notes and collateralized borrowings primarily consisting of bank loans  repurchase agreements and securities loaned 
short term funding generally is obtained at rates related to federal funds  libor and money market rates 
other borrowing costs are negotiated depending upon prevailing market conditions 
dlj has a billion revolving credit facility  of which billion may be unsecured 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december  consolidated cash flows net cash used by operating activities was billion for as compared to billion in and billion in cash used by operations in was attributable to the billion net change in trading activities and broker dealer receivables as compared to billion in reflecting dlj s increased level of business activity 
net cash provided by investing activities amounted to million for as compared to net cash used by investing activities of million in and million in in  investment sales  maturities and repayments exceeded purchases by million 
discontinued operations repaid million of loans from continuing operations during in  sales  maturities and repayments exceeded purchases by million 
decreases in loans to discontinued operations totaled million in in  purchases exceeded sales  maturities and repayments of investment assets by billion 
net cash provided by financing activities was billion in as compared to billion for and billion in during  withdrawals from policyholders account balances exceeded deposits by million as compared with million in short term financings  principally at dlj  showed a net increase of billion as compared to net increases of billion in while net additions to long term debt were higher by billion in compared to net increases of million in net cash provided by financing activities in included a billion net increase in short term financings principally due to the increase in business activity at dlj 
net cash withdrawals from general account policyholders account balances were million in in addition  in  net additions to long term debt were million 
the operating  investing and financing activities described above resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of billion in as compared to decreases of million in and million in market risk  risk management and derivative financial instruments the equitable s businesses are subject to market risks arising from its insurance asset liability management  asset management and trading activities 
such risks are evaluated and managed by each business on a decentralized basis 
primary market risk exposures result from interest rate fluctuations  equity price movements and changes in credit quality 
other than trading activities asset management 
alliance s investment portfolio primarily includes fixed income and money market investments that can generate predictable and steady rates of return 
alliance s management believes its fixed rate liabilities should be supported by its fixed income  money market and equity investments 
although these assets are purchased for long term investment  the portfolio strategy considers them available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates  equity prices and other relevant factors 
the objective is to maximize its investment returns taking into account interest rate  equity price and credit risks 
at december   alliance s interest rate  equity price and credit quality risks were not material to the equitable

insurance results significantly depend on profit margins between investment results from general account investment assets and interest credited on individual insurance and annuity products 
management believes its fixed rate liabilities should be supported by a portfolio principally composed of fixed rate investments that can generate predictable  steady rates of return 
although these assets are purchased for long term investment  the portfolio management strategy considers them available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in prepayment risk  changes in relative values of asset sectors and individual securities and loans  changes in credit quality outlook and other relevant factors 
the objective of portfolio management is to maximize returns  taking into account interest rate and credit risks 
insurance asset liability management discipline includes strategies to minimize exposure to loss as interest rates and economic and market conditions change 
as a result  the fixed maturity portfolio has modest exposure to call and prepayment risk and the vast majority of mortgage holdings are fixed rate mortgages that carry yield maintenance and prepayment provisions 
insurance assets with interest rate risk include fixed maturities and mortgage loans which make up of the carrying value of general account investment assets 
as part of its asset liability management  quantitative analyses are used to model the impact various changes in interest rates have on assets with interest rate risk 
the table below shows the impact an immediate basis point increase in interest rates at december  would have on the fair value of fixed maturities and mortgages interest rate risk exposure in millions fair value at basis december  point change continuing operations fixed maturities fixed rate   floating rate   mortgage loans   discontinued operations fixed maturities fixed rate floating rate mortgage loans holding company group fixed maturities fixed rate floating rate a basis point fluctuation in interest rates is a hypothetical rate scenario used to demonstrate potential risk  it does not represent management s view of future market changes 
while these fair value measurements provide a representation of interest rate sensitivity of fixed maturities and mortgage loans  they are based on insurance portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and may not be representative of future market results 
these exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities in response to management s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities 
the insurance investment portfolio also has direct holdings of public and private equity securities 
in addition  the general account is exposed to equity price risk from the excess of separate accounts assets over separate accounts liabilities 
the following table shows the potential exposure from those equity security investments  measured in terms of fair value  to an immediate drop in equity prices from those prevailing at december  equity price risk exposure in millions fair value at equity december  price change insurance group continuing operations discontinued operations excess of separate accounts assets over separate accounts liabilities holding company group a decrease in equity prices is a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent management s view of future market changes 
the fair value measurements shown are based on the equity securities portfolio exposures at a particular point in time and these exposures will change as a result of ongoing portfolio activities in response to management s assessment of changing market conditions and available investment opportunities 
at year end  the aggregate carrying value of policyholders liabilities was  million  including  million of the general account s investment contracts 
the aggregate fair value of those investment contracts at year end was  million 
the impact of a relative decrease in interest rates would be an increase in the fair value of those investment contracts to  million 
those investment contracts represent only a portion of total policyholders liabilities 
as such  meaningful assessment of net market risk exposure cannot be made by comparing the results of the invested assets sensitivity analyses presented herein to the potential exposure from the policyholders liabilities quantified in this paragraph 
asset liability management is integrated into many aspects of the insurance operations  including investment decisions  product development and determination of crediting rates 
as part of its risk management process  numerous economic scenarios are modeled  including cash flow testing required for insurance regulatory purposes  to determine if existing assets would be sufficient to meet projected liability cash flows 
key variables include policyholder behavior  such as persistency  under differing crediting rate strategies 
on the basis of these more comprehensive analyses  management believes there is no material solvency risk to equitable life with respect to interest rate movements up or down of basis points from year end levels or with respect to a drop in equity prices from year end levels 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  various derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  including interest rate swaps to convert floating rate assets to fixed rate assets  interest rate caps and floors to hedge crediting rates on interest sensitive products  and interest rate futures to hedge a decline in interest rates between receipt of funds and purchase of appropriate assets 
to minimize credit risk exposure associated with its derivative transactions  each counterparty s credit is appraised and approved and risk control limits and monitoring procedures are applied 
credit limits are established and monitored on the basis of potential exposures which take into consideration current market values and estimates of potential future movements in market values given potential fluctuations in market interest rates 
while notional amount is the most commonly used measure of volume in the derivatives market  it is not used by the insurance group as a measure of risk as the notional amount greatly exceeds the possible credit and market loss that could arise from such transactions 
mark to market exposure is a point in time measure of the value of a derivative contract in the open market 
a positive value indicates existence of credit risk for the insurance group as the counterparty would owe money to the insurance group if the contract were closed 
alternatively  a negative value indicates the insurance group would owe money to the counterparty if the contract were closed 
if there is more than one derivatives transaction outstanding with a counterparty  a master netting arrangement exists with the counterparty 
in that case  the market risk represents the net of the positive and negative exposures with the single counterparty 
in management s view  the net potential exposure is the better measure of credit risk 
at year end  the net market value exposure of insurance derivatives was million 
the table below shows the interest rate sensitivity of those derivatives  measured in terms of fair value

dlj monitors its market and counterparty risk on a daily basis through a number of control procedures designed to identify and evaluate the various risks to which dlj is exposed 
dlj established an independent risk oversight function to oversee risk policies and risk monitoring and management capabilities throughout dlj and to coordinate the risk management practices of the various business groups 
this department is assisted by a risk committee comprised of senior professionals from each of the operating and key administrative groups 
dlj has established various committees to help senior management manage risk associated with investment banking and merchant banking transactions 
these committees review potential clients and engagements  use experience with similar clients and situations  analyze credit for certain commitments and analyze dlj s potential role as a principal investor 
to control the risks associated with its banking activities  various committees review the details of all transactions before accepting an engagement 
from time to time  dlj invests in certain merchant banking transactions or other long term corporate development investments 
dlj s merchant banking group has established several investment entities  each of which has formed its own investment committee 
these committees make all investment and disposition decisions with respect to potential and existing portfolio companies 
in addition  senior officers of dlj meet to review merchant banking and corporate development investments 
after discussing the financial and operational aspects of the companies involved  they recommend carrying values for each investment to the finance committee 
then the finance committee reviews such recommendations and determines fair value 
dlj often acts as principal in customer related transactions in financial instruments which expose dlj to market risks 
dlj also engages in proprietary trading and arbitrage activities and makes dealer markets in equity securities  investment grade corporate debt  high yield securities  us government and agency securities  mortgages and mortgage backed securities and selected derivatives 
as such  to facilitate customer order flow  dlj maintains certain amounts of inventories 
dlj covers its exposure to market risk by limiting its net long or short position by selling or buying similar instruments and by utilizing various derivative financial instruments in the exchange traded and otc markets 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored continuously 
current and proposed underwriting  corporate development  merchant banking and other commitments are subject to due diligence reviews by senior management and by professionals in the appropriate business and support units involved 
trading activities generally result in inventory positions 
each day  position and exposure reports are prepared by operations staff in each of the business groups engaged in trading activities for traders  trading managers  department managers  divisional management and group management 
these reports are independently reviewed by dlj s corporate accounting group 
the corporate accounting group prepares a consolidated summarized position report listing both long and short exposure and approved limits 
the position report is distributed to various levels of management throughout dlj  including the chief executive officer  and it enables senior management to control inventory levels and monitor results of the trading groups 
dlj also reviews and monitors inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
in addition to position and exposure reports  dlj produces a daily revenue report that summarizes the trading  interest  commissions  fees  underwriting and other revenue items for each of the business groups 
daily revenue is reviewed for various risk factors and is independently verified by the corporate accounting group 
the daily revenue report is distributed to various levels of management throughout dlj  including the chief executive officer  and together with the position and exposure reports enables senior management to monitor and control overall activity of the trading groups 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss dlj may incur as a result of absolute and relative price movements in financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  and other factors 
dlj s exposure to market risk is directly related to its role as financial intermediary in customer related transactions and to its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
as of december   dlj s primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk  credit spread risk and foreign and equity price risk 
interest rate risk results from maintaining inventory positions and trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
interest rate risk arises from various sources including changes in the absolute and relative level of interest rates  interest rate volatility  mortgage prepayment rates and the shape of the yield curves in various markets 
dlj s investment grade high yield corporate bonds  mortgages  equities  derivatives and convertible debt activities also expose it to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential that changes in an issuer s credit rating would affect the value of financial instruments 
to cover its exposure to interest rate risk  dlj enters into transactions in us government securities  options and futures and forward contracts designed to reduce dlj s risk profile 
equity price risk results from maintaining inventory positions and making markets in equity securities 
equity price risk arises from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices  equity index exposure and equity index spreads which affect the value of equity securities 
to cover its exposure to equity price risk  dlj enters into transactions in options and futures designed to reduce dlj s risk profile 
value at risk in  dlj developed a company wide value at risk var model 
this model used a variance covariance approach with a confidence interval of and a one day holding period  based on historical data for one year 
dlj has made changes to the model in the course of in response to the volatile and illiquid markets of the third quarter of  which departed markedly from the normal statistical distributions that underlie the variance covariance approach  dlj has estimated var by using an historical simulation model based on two years of weekly historical data  a confidence interval  and a one day holding period 
the effect of this change in approach was not material 
the var number is the statistically expected maximum loss on the fair value of dlj s market sensitive instruments for of trading days 
in other words  on out of every trading days  the loss is expected to be statistically greater than the var number 
however  the model  does not indicate how much greater 
var models are designed to assist in risk management and to provide senior management with one probabilistic indicator of risk at the firm level 
var numbers should not be interpreted as a predictor of actual results 
dlj s var model has been specifically tailored for its risk management needs and to its risk profile 
dlj s var model includes the following limitations i a daily var does not capture the risk inherent in trading positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged in one day  ii var is based on historical market data and assumes that past trading patterns will predict the future  iii all inherent market risks cannot be perfectly modeled and iv correlations between market movements can vary  particularly in times of market stress 
dlj believes that a company wide var analysis is an important advance in its risk management but is aware of the limitations inherent in any statistical analysis 
because a var model alone is not a sufficient tool to measure and monitor market risk  dlj will continue to use other risk management measures such as stress testing  independent review of position and trading limits and daily revenue reports 
at december  and  company wide var for trading was approximately million and million  respectively  the company wide var for non trading market risk sensitive instruments is not separately disclosed because the amount is not significant 
due to the benefit of diversification  the company wide var is less than the sum of the individual components 
at december  and  the three main components of market risk  expressed in terms of theoretical fair values  had the following var december  in millions trading interest rate risk equity risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the increase in value at risk in over is due largely to the dramatic increase in volatility across a broad range of financial instruments 
credit risk credit risk related to various financing activities is reduced by the industry practice of obtaining and maintaining collateral 
each day  dlj monitors its exposure to counterparty risk through the use of credit exposure information and the monitoring of collateral values 
to establish appropriate exposure limits for a variety of transactions  all counterparties are reviewed on a periodic basis 
specific transactions are analyzed to assess the potential exposure and the counterparty s credit is reviewed to determine whether it supports such exposure 
dlj also analyzes market movements that could affect exposure levels 
to determine trading limits  dlj considers four main factors the settlement method  the time it will take for a trade to settle ie  the maturity of the trade  the volatility that could affect the value of the instruments involved in the trade  and the size of the trade 
in addition to determining trading limits  dlj actively manages the credit exposure by performing the following activities enters into master netting agreements when feasible  monitors the creditworthiness of counterparties and the related trading limits on an ongoing basis and requests additional collateral when deemed necessary  diversifies and limits exposure to individual counterparties and geographic locations  and limits the duration of exposure 
to mitigate credit risks  in certain cases  dlj may also close out transactions or assign them to other counterparties when deemed necessary or appropriate 
forward looking statements the equitable s management has made in this report  and from time to time may make in its public filings and press releases as well as in oral presentations and discussions  forward looking statements concerning the equitable s operations  economic performance and financial condition 
forward looking statements include  among other things  discussions concerning the equitable s potential exposure to market risks  as well as statements expressing management s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions  as indicated by words such as believes  estimates  intends  anticipates  expects  projects  should  probably  risk  target  goals  objectives  or similar expressions 
the equitable claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  and assumes no duty to update any forward looking statement 
forward looking statements are based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects and are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by forward looking statements due to a number of important factors including those discussed elsewhere in this report and in the equitable s other public filings  press releases  oral presentations and discussions 
the following discussion highlights some of the more important factors that could cause such differences 
market risk 
the equitable s businesses are subject to market risks arising from its insurance asset liability management  asset management and trading activities 
primary market risk exposures exist in the insurance and investment banking segments and result from interest rate fluctuations  equity price movements  changes in credit quality and  at dlj  foreign currency exchange exposure 
the nature of each of these risks is discussed under the caption market risk  risk management and derivative financial instruments and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year equitable life  dlj and alliance continue to address year compliance issues 
there can be no assurance that compliance schedules will be met  that the equitable s computer systems will operate as intended  that the systems  services and products of third parties will be year compliant or that cost estimates will be met 
any significant unresolved difficulties related to the year compliance initiatives could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  normal business activities or operations  or the incurrence of unanticipated expenses related to resolving such difficulties  regulatory actions  damage to the equitable s franchise  and legal liabilities and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on the equitable s business operations and financial results 
see year for a detailed discussion of the equitable s compliance initiatives 
strategic initiatives 
the equitable continues to implement certain strategic initiatives identified after a comprehensive review of its organization and strategy conducted in late these initiatives are designed to make the equitable a premier provider of financial planning  insurance and asset management products and services 
the branding initiative  which consists in part of a reorganization of certain wholly owned subsidiaries and changes to the names of such subsidiaries and the holding company  is designed to separate product manufacturing under the equitable name from product distribution under the axa name 
implementation of these strategic initiatives is subject to various uncertainties  including those relating to timing and expense  and the results of the implementation of these initiatives could be other than what management intends 
the equitable may  from time to time  explore selective acquisition opportunities in its core insurance and asset management businesses 
insurance 
the insurance group s future sales of life insurance and annuity products are dependent on numerous factors including successful implementation of the strategic initiatives referred to above  the intensity of competition from other insurance companies  banks and other financial institutions  the strength and professionalism of distribution channels  the continued development of additional channels  the financial and claims paying ratings of equitable life  its reputation and visibility in the market place  its ability to develop  distribute and administer competitive products and services in a timely  cost effective manner and its investment management performance 
in addition  the markets for products sold by the insurance group may be materially affected by changes in laws and regulations  including changes relating to savings  retirement funding and taxation 
the administration s year budget proposals contain provisions which  if enacted  could have a material adverse impact on sales of certain insurance products and would adversely affect the taxation of insurance companies 
see business segment information insurance and business regulation federal initiatives 
the profitability of insurance depends on a number of factors  including levels of operating expenses  secular trends and the equitable s mortality  morbidity  persistency and claims experience  and profit margins between investment results from general account investment assets and interest credited on individual insurance and annuity products 
the performance of general account investment assets depends  among other things  on levels of interest rates and the markets for equity securities and real estate  the need for asset valuation allowances and writedowns  and the performance of equity investments which have  and in the future may  create significant volatility in investment income 
see investment results of general account investment assets 
the ability of the equitable to continue its accelerated real estate sales program during without incurring net losses will depend on real estate markets for the remaining properties held for sale and the negotiation of transactions which confirm management s expectations on property values 
for further information  including information concerning the writedown in the fourth quarter of in connection with management s decision to accelerate the sale of certain real estate assets  see investment results of general account investment assets equity real estate 
the equitable s disability income di and group pension businesses produced pre tax losses in and in late  loss recognition studies for the di and group pension businesses were completed 
as a result  million of unamortized dac on di policies at december  was written off  reserves for directly written di policies and di reinsurance assumed were strengthened by million  and a pension par premium deficiency reserve was established which resulted in a million pre tax charge to results of continuing operations at december  based on the experience that emerged on these two books of business during and  management continues to believe the assumptions and estimates used to develop the di and pension par reserve strengthenings are reasonable 
however  there can be no assurance that they will be sufficient to provide for all future liabilities 
equitable life no longer underwrites new di policies 
equitable life is reviewing the arrangements pursuant to which a third party manages claims incurred under di policies previously issued by equitable life and is exploring its ability to dispose of the di business through reinsurance 
see combined operating results by segment insurance 
investment banking 
for the years ended december   and  investment banking accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the equitable s consolidated earnings from continuing operations before federal income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of accounting change 
dlj s business activities include securities underwriting  sales and trading  merchant banking  financial advisory services  investment research  venture capital  correspondent brokerage services  online interactive brokerage services and asset management 
these activities are subject to various risks  including volatile trading markets and fluctuations in the volume of market activity 
consequently  dlj s net income and revenues have been  and may continue to be  subject to wide fluctuations  reflecting the impact of many factors beyond dlj s control  including securities market conditions  the level and volatility of interest rates  competitive conditions and the size and timing of transactions 
over the last several years dlj s results have been at historically high levels 
see combined operating results by segment investment banking for a discussion of the negative impact on dlj in the second half of of global economic problems  particularly in japan and in emerging markets including russia and asia 
potential losses could result from dlj s merchant banking activities as a result of their capital intensive nature 
asset management 
alliance s revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management and are therefore affected by market appreciation or depreciation  additions and withdrawals of assets  purchases and redemptions of mutual funds and shifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures 
see combined operating results by segment asset management 
discontinued operations 
the determination of the allowance for future losses for the discontinued wind up annuities and gic lines of business continues to involve numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those regarding expected performance of investment assets  ultimate mortality experience and other factors which affect investment and benefit projections 
there can be no assurance the losses provided for will not differ from the losses ultimately realized 
to the extent actual results or future projections of discontinued operations differ from management s current best estimates underlying the allowance  the difference would be reflected as earnings or loss from discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of earnings 
in particular  to the extent income  sales proceeds and holding periods for equity real estate differ from management s previous assumptions  periodic adjustments to the allowance are likely to result 
see discontinued operations for further information including discussion of significant reserve strengthening in and and the assumptions used in making cash flow projections 
technology and information systems 
the equitable s information systems are central to  among other things  designing and pricing products  marketing and selling products and services  processing policyholder and investor transactions  client recordkeeping  communicating with agents  employees and clients  and recording information for accounting and management information purposes 
any significant difficulty associated with the operation of such systems  or any material delay or inability to develop needed system capabilities  could have a material adverse affect on the equitable s results of operations and  ultimately  its ability to achieve its strategic goals 
legal environment 
a number of lawsuits have been filed against life and health insurers involving insurers sales practices  alleged agent misconduct  failure to properly supervise agents and other matters 
some of the lawsuits have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against other insurers  including material amounts of punitive damages  or in substantial settlements 
in some states  juries have substantial discretion in awarding punitive damages 
the equitable s insurance subsidiaries  like other life and health insurers  are involved in such litigation 
while no such lawsuit has resulted in an award or settlement of any material amount against the equitable to date  its results of operations and financial condition could be affected by defense and settlement costs and any unexpected material adverse outcomes in such litigations as well as in other material litigations pending against the holding company and its subsidiaries 
in addition examinations by federal and state regulators could result in adverse publicity  sanctions and fines 
for further information see business regulation and legal proceedings 
future accounting pronouncements 
in the future  new accounting pronouncements may have material effects on the equitable s consolidated statements of earnings and shareholders equity 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for pronouncements issued but not implemented 
in addition  members of the naic approved its codification project providing regulators and insurers with uniform statutory guidance  addressing areas where statutory accounting previously was silent and changing certain existing statutory positions 
equitable life will be subject to codification to the extent and in the form adopted in new york state  which would require action by both the new york legislature and the new york insurance department 
it is not possible to predict whether  in what form  or when codification will be adopted in new york  and accordingly it is not possible to predict the effect of codification on equitable life 
regulation and statutory capital and surplus 
the businesses conducted by the equitable s subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by state insurance departments and federal and state agencies regulating  among other things  insurance and annuities  securities transactions  investment banking  investment companies and investment advisors 
changes in the regulatory environment could have a material impact on operations and results 
the activities of the insurance group are subject to the supervision of the insurance regulators of each of the states 
such regulators have the discretionary authority  in connection with the continual licensing of members of the insurance group  to limit or prohibit new issuances of business to policyholders within their jurisdiction when  in their judgment  such regulators determine that such member is not maintaining adequate statutory surplus or capita
