environmental matters the nature of the company s operations  primarily services  would not ordinarily involve it in environmental contamination 
however  the company s operations are subject to various federal  state and or local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  such as discharge into soil  water and air  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous substances 
these laws generally have the effect of increasing costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of the company s operations  although historically they have not had a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or its results of operations 
the company is currently involved in four proceedings relating to environmental matters one involving alleged potential soil and groundwater contamination at a company facility in florida  one involving alleged potential soil contamination at a former company facility in arizona  one involving alleged potential soil and groundwater contamination of a parking garage previously operated by the company in washington  and  one involving alleged potential soil and groundwater contamination at a former dry cleaning facility leased by the company in nevada 
while it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  based on information currently available  management believes that none of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  are reasonably likely to have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position or its results of operations 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written and embedded chips being designed that use two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  there is a potential that existing computer programs and hardware will be unable to accurately process dates beyond the year this could result in system errors or failures that could impact both administration and operations 
in mid  the company established a dedicated project team that has initiated a company wide effort to mitigate the year issue 
the project team has developed a detailed plan for becoming year compliant that consists of the following seven phases awareness  inventory  risk assessment  remediation  testing  implementation  and certification 
the year issue encompasses both information technology it related systems  such as the company s accounting software  and non it related systems such as the impact to the company due to the non compliance of major vendors or customers 
the company is striving to make all levels of management within the company cognizant of the year issue via quarterly newsletters 
this newsletter provides year progress updates to management  who are then able to communicate with customers  vendors  and other third parties 
additionally  the year project team maintains a discussion database that is available to managers within the company for their review and input 
the project team has completed a company wide inventory of all office equipment  software  hardware  and any product  equipment service or system that could be impacted by the year issue 
this inventory has provided a basis for identifying and prioritizing risk associated with the equipment  hardware  software  and services that the company utilizes 
the project team has attempted to assess all relevant issues and has developed a process to assess all new products and services introduced subsequent to the initial inventory 
the certification of all office equipment and products is approximately percent complete  and is anticipated to be finished by april the project team is in the remediation and testing phases for its core application programs 
all proprietary software  such as its accounting programs  service dispatch systems  and labor control systems  has been fully remediated and is now being tested 
mission critical proprietary applications  such as the accounting and payroll programs  have also been tested and certified to be year compliant by an outside vendor using a second generation code inspection tool 
six divisions use the company s proprietary accounting software  which is internally maintained 
the elevator  lighting and mechanical divisions use software purchased from outside vendors 
the financial software used by the elevator division has been tested and reviewed by the company and outside consultants 
the supply division s inventory control system and the lighting division s financial applications are currently being tested for compliance 
the mechanical division will be replacing its accounting and dispatching software with a year compliant system 
the project team has identified vendors that represent percent of the company s total purchases  and in october  began surveying these vendors to identify their plans to address the year issue 
this process is expected to be complete by march all vendors with mission critical it related products or services are being tested as mentioned above 
the company is amending its vendor selection process  as needed  to minimize potential vendor related year risks 
the company has remediated and is testing company owned equipment and software that could have an impact on operations  and indirectly the company s customers 
the company believes that appropriate steps are being taken to minimize potential risk to its customers  however  there is a concern that customer owned equipment may not be year compliant  which will adversely impact the company s operational performance 
additionally  there may be a misconception among customers that abm is responsible for all year issues 
the company plans to inform all customers in writing of the responsibility that the company is taking with regard to the year issue 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be year compliant  or that the failure of such systems to be year compliant will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
based upon assumptions and forecasts of management at this time  the company estimates the cost of becoming year compliant to be approximately million  funded by operating cash flows 
the company believes it is making the necessary modifications and changes to mitigate the year issue 
however  there can be no assurance that all the company s systems will be year compliant  that the costs to be year compliant will not exceed management s current expectations  or that the failure of such systems to be year compliant will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is establishing contingency plans for all its major it systems  field office locations  and largest accounts  in case of unexpected year failures 
as part of its contingency plans  the company intends to prepare process manuals that will document the necessary procedures in the event of it related failures  such as hardware or software applications  as well as non it failures 
these procedures will be tested to be certain that the procedures are viable alternatives in the case of a year disruption 
these manuals will be distributed to all offices of the company for its preparation for year acquisitions the operating results of businesses acquired have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition and are fully discussed on note to the consolidated financial statements

the company anticipates these costs may be gradually recovered through future price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million in as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from for  to for  primarily as a result of certain fixed and variable costs not increasing at the same rate as sales 
the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million is primarily due to expenses related to growth and to a lesser extent expenses associated with acquisitions including the amortization of goodwill

net income for was million  an increase of  compared to net income of million in diluted net income per common share rose to for compared to for the same period in the increase in diluted net income per share was not proportional to the increase in net income due to the increase in number of diluted shares outstanding primarily a result of purchases made by employees under the company s employee stock purchase plan

due to low unemployment levels in this division s major markets  labor and labor related costs increased  but were offset by price increases 
ampco system parking s revenues increased by  while its profits increased during compared to the increase in revenues was mostly due to growth in its national airport business and its texas region 
the operating profit increase was due for the most part to lower payroll tax expense and the increased sales 
as reported previously in the company s form q filings  this segment now includes the company s new division  abm facility services 
the establishment of this division was a result of customer requests to provide services from two or more of its other divisions the abm family of services under one management 
much of the revenues generated by this division are reported by the respective abm divisions that perform the services  and therefore contribute to the operating profits of those divisions 
because this division is new and depends primarily on management fees for its income  start up costs exceeded those fees during its first year 
at the present time  management does not expect this division to be profitable during because anticipated management fees are not yet adequate to support the necessary infrastructure

selling  general and administrative expense increased million from million in to million in but increased slightly as a percentage of revenues from to in the dollar amount of increase in selling  general and administrative expense is due to increases in marketing expenses as well as legal  accounting  and goodwill amortization expenses associated with acquisitions
