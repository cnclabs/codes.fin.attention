year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram and test the systems for year compliance

the company s suppliers are also engaged in their year testing and the company is monitoring their progress 
in addition  in the event that a supplier is unable to become year compliant  the company s supplier network is sufficient  and material and services are available to the company to adjust to a change in a production supply without compromising the manufacturing schedule established by the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely also will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems
