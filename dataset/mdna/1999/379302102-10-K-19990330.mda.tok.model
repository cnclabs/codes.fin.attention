it also prescribes specific accounting principles to be applied to hedging activities and hedging transactions which are significantly different from prior accounting principles 
the company has not yet determined the impact of sfas no 
the company recognizes that year issues may have an impact on its business  operations and financial condition 
the company has completed an assessment of its year readiness with respect to all of its information technology it systems and the reliability and condition of its non it systems 
the company has obtained status updates regarding year issues on these systems either via contacting the manufacturers and vendors  or by acquiring the necessary information from their websites 
the company s it systems generally consist of file servers  operating systems  application programs and workstations that utilize purchased systems 
the company has evaluated the year compliance status of each vendor and believes that its existing systems and planned upgrades  to be completed by second quarter  will be year compliant 
implementation of planned upgrades will not result in significant additional cost to the company 
the company does not have any mainframe midrange computer codes to verify 
the data generated using off the shelf packages is being analyzed and fixed to use the proper date format 
all of the company s servers and workstations use intel based processors and the company has used third party applications to verify these systems 
planned upgrades and new purchases have eliminated several non compliant systems 
the company plans to phase out the remaining older computers during the second quarter the majority of the remaining issues will be resolved via a planned upgrade to windows and ms office later this year 
the company is currently negotiating with it firms to verify its tests and validate its correction and testing methods 
the costs incurred by the company at the present time have been internal costs only 
the company expects to spend no more than  for outside consultants to give additional assurance on its it systems 
the source of these funds will be from operations 
the significant risks to the company in the event that year issues are not identified and corrected include the possibility that it system problems could cause delays or errors in processing financial and operation information 
the year issue has not affected any of the company s it system decisions 
at the present time the company has planned upgrades in progress that will not be delayed or accelerated due to year issues 
the company s contingency plan recognizes that the biggest exposures are non it systems which may result in year issues 
these exposures are facility related and encompass areas such as hvac systems  elevators  security  lighting  telecommunications  electrical  plumbing  fire and sprinkler controls  as well as our reliance on outside contractors for services such as security  janitorial and exterior maintenance 
at the present time  the company has not identified any instances where year issues will require material costs to repair or replace any of these systems 
if failure does incur in any of these provided services as a result of year issues  the company is prepared to correct the problem with manual labor  either hired or internally which could cause a short term limitation in the efficiency of the company s properties operations 
while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on the company 
other the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when tenant occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve most of their temporary tenant rents during the holiday season 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
the retail industry has experienced some difficulty  which is reflected in sales trends and in the bankruptcies and continued restructuring of several prominent retail organizations 
continuation of these trends could impact future earnings performance 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years and has had a minimal impact on the company s properties 
many tenants leases contain provisions designed to lessen the impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases are for terms of less than years  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rentals if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
substantially all of the leases  other than those for anchors  require the tenants to pay a proportionate share of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
inflation may however  have a negative impact on some of the company s other operating items 
interest expense and general and administrative expenses may be adversely affected by inflation as these specified costs could increase at a rate higher than rents 
also  for tenant leases with stated rent increases  inflation may have a negative effect as the stated rent increases in these leases could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time
