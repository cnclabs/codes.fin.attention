in the face of increased competition in the industry  there can be no assurance that the company will not face increased pricing pressure  which in turn could lead to changes in the selling price of the securityguard system or services furnished by the company 
the impact of any such price changes on the company s revenue or operating results cannot be accurately determined

ffc is a consumer and business finance company operating in australia and new zealand 
ffc specializes in the provision of consumer credit  primarily to purchasers of the securityguard system through sales finance arrangements with the company and participants in the distributor network  and also through personal loan and insurance products which are not currently part of the company s business 
for the year ended june  approximately of the principal amount of loans made by ffc were derived from consumer loans to finance purchases of the securityguard system by end users in australia and new zealand

the assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date exchange rate

because of fluctuations in the values of currencies in which the company receives revenues against the us dollar  the company believes that period to period comparisons of reported financial results  may not fully reflect sales and other operating trends for the periods compared

the total receivable due from ama the ama receivable increased from  as at june  to million as at june  the ama receivable balance of million as at june  is not expected to increase materially in the next fiscal year as the repayment cycle has reached maturity and ama sales are expected to remain constant 
the ama receivable is secured by a fixed and floating charge over ama s finance receivables generated from the company s ama sales 
use of cash related to accounts receivable during the fiscal year ended june  of million was wholly attributable to the increase in the ama receivable 
use of cash related to the million in deferred income tax during fiscal year ended june  was a result of the following  i deferred tax assets of million were booked during the fiscal year ended june  predominately relating to future income tax benefits derived from the parent  ii provisional income tax installments paid during the year relating to the fiscal year ended june   and iii million in timing difference attributable to the ness transaction resulting in overpayment of provisional income tax by ness security products pty limited during the year ended june  ness security products pty limited expects to recoup the overpayment upon remittance of its next provisional tax payment

as of june   ness had fully repaid it s borrowing from westpac 
assuming a restructuring of the ness note on terms favorable to the company  the company believes that internally generated cashflows will be adequate to support currently planned business operations over the next twelve months 
the company s strategy for growth is based on the expansion of its distributor network into existing and new markets  with the costs of such expansion largely borne by the distributor and the introduction of point of sale on line monitoring 
it is expected that excess cashflows generated by the company will be used to fund its upgrade on line monitoring program and international expansion 
the company may be required to obtain additional capital to fund growth from other financing sources if the cashflow generated by the australian and new zealand and european operations is insufficient to meet the cash requirements of developing the international operations 
potential sources of such capital may include proceeds from bank financing or additional offerings of the equity or debt securities of the company 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on acceptable terms from these or other potential sources 
the lack of such capital could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations

this statement is a year readiness disclosure entitled to protection as provided in the year information and readiness disclosure act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is foreign currency fluctuations 
geographically  the majority of the company s operating subsidiaries are located outside the united states  with operations conducted in their respective local currencies 
accordingly  the company s financial performance could be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
furthermore  as the company reports its financial results in us dollars  a significant movement in the value of the us dollar against certain international currencies  particularly the australian dollar aud  could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial position and results of operations 
a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted reported earnings by approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  in addition  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect the company s cash reserve balances 
the company s subsidiaries hold cash and cash equivalents in local currency in order to provide liquidity for day to day operations 
a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted the company s cash reserves balances by approximately million at june  the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of the ffc note 
the ffc note bears interest at a rate of per annum payable monthly in arrears  is denominated in australian dollars  is payable in installments and matures december  at june   aud  was outstanding under the ffc note 
the present value of the future cash outlays assuming a discount factor was equivalent to aud  million at june  a hypothetical fluctuation in the aud would have impacted the future cash outlays committed under the ffc note at june  by approximately million 
although the company is not in the business of currency hedging  it may from time to time engage in currency hedging arrangements 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in limiting risks related to currency fluctuations or that changes in exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on the company or its results of operations
