the company s component cost and purchase price allocation for its north american acquisitions for each of the four years ended december    and are as follows component cost and purchase price allocation in millions assets acquired cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable telecommunications equipment deposits and others intangible assets goodwill intangible assets customer base liabilities assumed accounts payable and other long term liabilities long term debt equity increase to shareholders equity total cash invested total net liabilities assumed total stock issued total purchase price europe 
eu member states are in various stages of deregulation 
deregulation in these countries may occur either because the member states of the eu decide to open up their own markets eg  the united kingdom  sweden and finland or because they are directed to do so by the ec through one or more directives issued thereby 
in the latter case  such an ec directive would be addressed to the national legislative body of each eu member state  calling for such legislative body to implement such directive through the passage of national legislation 
although interconnection was not available and implemented in most eu countries by january  as called for by an ec directive  the current regulatory scheme in the eu nevertheless provides an opportunity for the company to provide a range of services immediately in many countries  while putting in place adequate infrastructure to capitalize on final deregulation if and when it occurs 
the company can provide value added services before interconnection is available and  in certain eu member states  the company is already providing dial in access  coupled  when possible  with autodialers or the programming of customers phone systems to dial access codes  to route traffic over the domestic pstn to the company s switches 
as of december   the company had recorded an aggregate of approximately million of goodwill in connection with its european acquisitions

the company s component cost and purchase price allocation for its european acquisitions for each of the four years ended december    and are as follows component cost and purchase price allocation in millions assets acquired cash accounts receivable telecommunications equipment deposits and others intangible assets goodwill intangible assets customer base intangible assets name liabilities assumed accounts payable and other long term liabilities lease commitments equity increase to shareholders equity total cash invested total net liabilities assets assumed total stock issued total purchase price revenues the company provides both domestic and international long distance voice communications services 
revenues are derived from the number of minutes of use or fractions thereof billed by the company and are recorded upon completion of calls 
the company also derives revenues from prepaid calling cards 
these revenues are recognized at the time of usage or upon expiration of the card 
the company maintains local market pricing structures for its services and generally prices its services at a discount to the prices charged by the local ptts and major carriers 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  declining revenue per minute in all of its markets as a result of increasing competition in telecommunications  which the company expects will be offset by increased minute volumes and decreased operating costs per minute

the company s us revenues result primarily from the sale of long distance voice services on a retail basis to commercial customers  on a bulk discount basis to distributors of prepaid calling cards  and on a wholesale basis to other carriers 
the company experiences significant month to month changes in revenues generated by its carrier customers ie  customers who acquire the company s services for the purpose of reselling such services on a wholesale basis to other carriers or on a retail basis to end users 
the company believes such carrier customers will react to temporary price fluctuations and spot market availability that will impact the company s carrier revenues 
over the past two years  the company has shifted its marketing focus in the united states to small and medium sized businesses and has restructured its pricing of wholesale services to other carriers 
the company believes that as a result of these changes to its business and as a result of utilizing a greater proportion of owned versus leased facilities  the company has begun to experience decreasing quarterly losses commencing in january the company has derived increased revenues from its commercial customers  and it continues to reduce its reliance on wholesale carrier revenues 
the company has begun deriving additional north american revenues as a result of its recent acquisition of westel in canada and westcomm in the us see business company operations north america

substantially all revenues from the company s european operations are derived from commercial sales to end users 
sales are targeted at small to medium sized corporate customers  as well as to niche consumer markets including selected ethnic communities 
to reduce its credit risk to such niche consumer markets  the company primarily offers prepaid products to its targeted consumer 
each of the countries in which the company operates has experienced different levels of deregulation  resulting in various levels of competition and differing ranges of services which the company is permitted to offer its customers 
the company also believes that as it pursues its strategic growth strategy it will continue to encounter various degrees of start up time 
effect of deregulation on european revenues 
the company operates in various countries in europe  each of which is in a different state of deregulation 
in certain of these countries  current regulatory restrictions limit the company s ability to offer a broader array of products and services and limit the availability of those services to customers 
the company anticipates that deregulation will have a favorable impact on revenues because i customers will be able to access the company s services more easily and ii the company will have the ability to provide a broader array of products and services 
the company believes that  with established or start up operations in european countries  it will be well positioned to benefit from the anticipated continued deregulation of european markets 
however  there can be no assurance regarding the timing or extent of deregulation in any particular country

asia pacific rim operations inception april through year ended december  december  in thousands  except percentage of consolidated revenues revenues   percentage of consolidated revenues operating costs and expenses cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below   selling  general and administrative expenses   depreciation and amortization  loss from operations   the company commenced asia pacific rim revenue producing operations through its australian entity with the acquisition of a customer base in australia in the second quarter of the company initiated operations in japan through rsl com japan kk in july latin american operations the company commenced latin american revenue producing operations in venezuela in the third quarter of the company s operations in venezuela have generated approximately  and  in revenues in and  respectively 
cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization the company s cost of services is comprised of costs associated with gaining local access and the transport and termination of calls over rsl net 
the majority of the company s cost of services are variable  including local access charges and transmission capacity leased on a per minute of use basis 
the company plans to make significant investments in irus  mius and domestic circuits and  as a result  expects an increasing amount of its total operating costs to become fixed  as the volume of the company s calls carried over its own facilities increases 
as the company migrates increasing amounts of traffic from leased facilities to owned facilities  the company experiences improving operating results in those operations where such traffic migration occurs 
the depreciation expense with respect to the company s mius and irus is not accounted for in cost of services 
in addition  the company intends to lower its variable cost of termination as a percentage of revenues by carrying traffic pursuant to more of its existing operating agreements and by negotiating additional operating agreements on strategic routes 
the company has directly linked certain of its local operators in europe and the united states utilizing lines leased on a fixed cost point to point basis and mius and irus 
to the extent traffic can be transported between two local operators over mius or irus  there is only marginal cost to the company with respect to the international portion of a call other than the fixed lease payment or the capital expenditure incurred in connection with the purchase of the mius or irus 
the company s cost of transport and termination will decrease to the extent that it is able to bypass the settlement rates associated with the transport of international traffic 
while the company intends to purchase or construct intranational transmission facilities where such facilities are available for purchase or may be constructed and such investments are cost effective and warranted by traffic patterns  a significant percentage of its intranational transmission facilities will continue to be leased on a variable cost basis 
accordingly  variable costs will continue to be a majority of the company s cost of services for the foreseeable future 
effect of deregulation on european cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization the company s current cost structure varies from country to country  in part  as a result of the different level of regulatory policies in place in each country 
in general  the company s cost structure is lower in countries that have been substantially deregulated than in those which are partially deregulated and certain of the company s european operations have become cash flow positive 
in countries that are not substantially deregulated  the company s access to the local exchange network is through more expensive means ie  leased lines or dial in access 
this results in higher costs to the company for carrying international traffic originating within one country and terminating in another country 
in addition  local regulations in many countries restrict the company from purchasing capacity on international cable and fiber systems 
the company must instead either enter into long term lease agreements for international capacity at a high fixed cost or purchase per minute of use termination rates from the dominant carrier 
deregulation in countries in which the company operates is expected to permit the company to i interconnect its switches with the local exchange network and ii purchase its own international facilities 
the company believes that deregulation will result in improved european operating results 
deregulation in a particular country is also expected to permit the company to terminate international inbound traffic in such country which will result in an improved cost structure for the company as a whole 
however  the foregoing is a forward looking statement and there can be no assurance that deregulation will proceed as expected or lower the company s cost of services 
selling  general and administrative expenses the company s selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs incurred to support the continued expansion of rsl net  the introduction of new services and the provision of ongoing customer service 
these costs are principally comprised of costs associated with employee compensation  occupancy  insurance  professional fees  sales and marketing including sales commissions and bad debt expenses 
in addition  as the company commences operations in different countries  it incurs significant start up costs  which are expensed in the period incurred  particularly for hiring  training and retention of personnel  leasing of office space and advertising 
the company has grown and intends to continue to grow by establishing operations in countries that are in the process of being deregulated and that originate and terminate large volumes of international traffic or offer other strategic benefits 
each of the company s operations is in a different stage of development 
the early stages of development of a new operation involve substantial start up costs in advance of revenues 
upon the commencement of such operations  the company generally incurs additional fixed costs to facilitate growth 
the company expects that during periods of significant expansion  selling  general and administrative expenses will increase materially 
accordingly  the company s consolidated results of operations will vary depending on the timing and speed of the company s expansion strategy and  during a period of rapid expansion  will not necessarily reflect the performance of the company s more established local operators 
acquisition accounting since its formation in  the company has expanded its revenues  customer base and network through internal growth and acquisitions 
all of its acquisitions were negotiated on an arm s length basis with unaffiliated third parties 
the company accounted for all of its acquisitions of controlling interests using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the respective purchase prices have been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at their dates of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill  which is being amortized over a to year period 
for periods prior to april   the company had included of the losses of its loss generating subsidiaries in its results of operations because the book value of the minority interests in these subsidiaries has been reduced to below zero 
the company s non us subsidiaries denominate revenues  costs  assets and liabilities for the most part in local currencies 
all of the subsidiaries  however  report their financial results in us dollars pursuant to us gaap

this was offset by the company s european operations which experienced problems in purchasing capacity in germany and france due to certain delays in implementing deregulation in these countries 
accordingly  traffic arising from increased prepaid card sales in these countries had to be carried over uneconomical overflow capacity which produced low and in certain cases negative gross margins for the company s prepaid operations in germany and france

any of the programs used in the company s operations that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations  or other computer errors  causing disruptions of operations 
the potential for failures encompasses all aspects of the company s business  including computer systems and voice networks  and could cause  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  billing and customer service or to engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is implementing a comprehensive program of analysis of and or changes to its computer systems to ensure that all such systems are  or prior to the end of will be  year compliant 
the company s year project includes the following phases i conducting a comprehensive inventory of the company s internal systems  including information technology systems and non information technology systems which include switching  billing and other platforms and electrical systems and the systems acquired or to be acquired by the company  ii assessing and prioritizing any required remediation  iii remediating any problems by repairing or  if appropriate  replacing the non compliant systems and iv testing all remediated systems for year compliance 
the company has also retained a year solution provider as a consultant to assist the company in its assessment and remediation projects and to manage and coordinate year compliance for each of the local operators on a global basis 
in addition to assessing its own systems  the company is conducting an external review of its vendors and suppliers  including equipment and systems providers and other telecommunications service providers  to determine their vulnerability to year problems and any potential impact on the company 
based on discussions with ericsson  the company s primary equipment vendor  the company believes that the equipment provided to the company by ericsson will be year compliant 
the company may experience problems to the extent that other telecommunications carriers whose services are resold by the company or to which the company sends traffic for termination are not year compliant 
there can be no assurance that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company expects to complete all of the phases of the process described above by june  and further expects that all of its computer systems will be fully year compliant before the end of there can be no assurance  however  that the company will achieve full year compliance before the end of or that effective contingency plans will be developed or implemented 
a failure of the company s computer systems or the failure of the company s vendors or customers to effectively upgrade their software and systems for transition to the year could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
the company has completed numerous acquisitions during recent periods and is in the process of integrating the systems of the acquired businesses into the company s operations 
those systems are included in the company s year review and remediation project 
during the process of evaluating businesses for potential acquisition  and after any such acquisitions  the company will evaluate the extent of the year problems associated with such acquisitions and the cost and timing of remediation 
no assurance can be given  however  that the systems of any acquired business will be year compliant when acquired or will be capable of timely remediation 
the company estimates that it will incur costs of approximately million to become year compliant 
costs associated with software modification are expensed by the company when incurred  and resulted in  of expense as of december  following the completion of the company s year assessment and the implementation of the company s year project  the company plans to determine the nature and extent of any contingency plans that may be required 
even if the company s assessment is completed without identifying any additional material non compliant systems operated by  or under the control of  the company  or of third parties  the most likely worst case scenario would be a systems failure beyond the control of the company to remedy 
such a failure could materially prevent the company from operating its business 
the company believes that such a failure would likely lead to lost revenues  increased operating costs  loss of customers or other business interruptions of a material nature  in addition to potential claims against the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has not entered into any financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  as its revenues  costs  assets and liabilities are  for the most part  denominated in local currencies 
the results of operations of the company s subsidiaries  as reported in us dollars  may be significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the local currencies in which the company transacts business 
the company recorded a foreign currency translation adjustment of million for the year ended december  such amount is recorded upon the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars  and is dependent upon the various foreign exchange rates and the magnitude of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements 
as of december   the company had recorded a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately million  primarily as a result of the increase in the deutsche mark against the us dollar in connection with the dm notes as defined 
the company incurs settlement costs when it exchanges traffic via operating agreements with foreign correspondents 
these costs currently represent a small portion of the total costs of services  however  as the company s international operations increase  it expects that these costs will become a more significant portion of its cost of services 
such costs are settled by utilizing a net settlement process with the company s foreign correspondents comprised of special drawing rights sdrs 
sdrs are the established method of settlement among international telecommunications carriers 
the sdrs are valued based upon a basket of foreign currencies and the company believes that this mitigates  to some extent  its foreign currency exposure 
the company has monitored and will continue to monitor its currency exposure  and  if necessary  may enter into forward contracts and or similar instruments to mitigate the potential impacts of such risks 
the company is currently not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations since the majority of the company s long term debt obligations are at fixed rates 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk  as additional financing may be required due to the large operating losses and capital expenditures associated with establishing and expanding the company s networks and facilities 
the interest rate that the company will be able to obtain on additional financing will depend on market conditions at that time  and may differ from the rates the company has secured on its current debt 
the company does not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swap and or similar instruments 
the company s carrying value of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  marektable securities available for sale  restricted marketable securities held to maturity  accrued expenses and notes payable is a reasonable approximation of their fair value 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt was estimated to be million based on the overall weighted average rate of the company s long term debt of and an overall weighted average maturity of years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of basis points in interest rates ten percent of the company s overall weighted average borrowing rate 
such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease in fair value of the company s long term debt
