item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following discussion analyzes significant changes in the results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   and for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  operating revenues and kilowatt hour sales of the company s total electric operating revenues during  approximately were from residential customers  from commercial customers  from industrial customers  from wholesale on system customers and from wholesale off system transactions 
the remainder of such revenues were derived from miscellaneous sources 
the percentage changes from the prior year in kilowatt hour kwh sales and revenue by major customer class were as follows kwh sales revenues residential commercial industrial wholesale on system total system kwh sales for the company s on system customers increased during primarily due to above average temperatures during the second and third quarters 
revenues increased more than the corresponding increase in kwh sales primarily due to increased rates in missouri and arkansas as reflected in the table below and the winter summer differential in rates 
this differential results from summer rates being higher than winter rates  so warm summer temperatures that increase summer kwh usage cause the corresponding annual revenues to increase at a greater rate 
customer growth increased slightly to in as compared to in residential kwh sales increased while commercial kwh sales increased as compared to  primarily due to the above average temperatures 
industrial classes  although not particularly weather sensitive  also showed an increase in kwh sales and revenues due to continued increases in business activity throughout the company s service territory as well as the missouri and arkansas rate increases 
on system wholesale kwh sales were up significantly in  reflecting the warm summer temperatures and the continued increases in business activity 
revenues associated with these sales increased more than the corresponding kwh sales as a result of the operation of the fuel adjustment clause applicable to such ferc regulated sales 
this clause permits changes in fuel and purchased power costs to be passed along to customers without the need for a rate proceeding 
kwh sales for the company s on system customers increased only slightly during due to cool summer weather  while revenues increased more than the corresponding increase in kwhs primarily due to increased rates in missouri as reflected in the table below 
customer growth slowed from in to in residential kwh sales decreased slightly compared to due to a milder first half of while revenues for the period increased because of increases in missouri rates during the last half of commercial and industrial classes showed an increase in kwh sales and revenues in because their sales are not as impacted by weather 
revenues from the on system wholesale customers increased more than the kwh sales for that class due to the operation of the fuel adjustment clause 
the following table sets forth information regarding electric rate increases affecting the revenue comparisons discussed above percent date increase increase increase date jurisdiction requested requested granted granted effective arkansas   missouri   an increase of  was granted effective an additional  increase became effective the company s future revenues from the sale of electricity will continue to be affected by economic conditions  business activities  competition  deregulation of the energy industry  weather  regulation  changes in electric rate levels and changing patterns of electric energy use by customers 
inflation affects the company s operations in that historical costs rather than current replacement costs are recovered in the company s rates 
off system transactions in addition to sales to its own customers  the company sells power to other utilities to the extent it is available and provides transmission service through its system for transactions between other energy suppliers 
during revenues from such off system transactions were approximately million as compared to approximately million during and approximately during the margin on such off system sales is lower than on sales to the company s on system customers 
in addition  pursuant to an order issued by the ferc and subsequent tariffs filed by the company and spp  these off system sales have been opened up to competition 
the company cannot predict  however  the effect such competition will have on its future operations or financial results 
see competition below for more information on these open access tariffs 
operating revenue deductions during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
total fuel costs were up approximately million due primarily to the increased generation from higher cost gas fired combustion turbine units at both state line and the energy center 
this increased generation was due to increased customer demand in the second and third quarters of resulting from the warmer temperatures 
increased gas usage is a trend the company expects to continue  especially when the state line project begins commercial operation 
natural gas prices were lower by during as compared to  helping to offset some of the increased fuel expense 
total purchased power costs increased slightly by approximately million during other operating expenses increased approximately million during  compared to  due primarily to increases in customer accounts expense and administrative and general expense 
approximately million of this increase was a one time charge due to the initiation of the directors stock unit plan  a stock based retirement compensation program for the company s directors 
maintenance and repairs expense increased approximately million during scheduled maintenance resulting from increased usage of the gas fired combustion turbines at the energy center and the state line power plant accounted for approximately million of this increase while approximately million resulted from the first quarter spring maintenance outage at the asbury plant and the second quarter five year scheduled maintenance outage at the riverton plant 
transmission and distribution system maintenance contributed million to the increase 
maintenance and repair expense is expected to increase significantly in the first quarter of as a result of a new year s day ice storm that interrupted service to approximately  of the company s missouri and kansas customers over a three day period 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during  compared to  due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service 
total income taxes increased approximately million during due primarily to higher taxable income during the current year 
see note of notes to financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes were up approximately million during the year largely as a result of increased property taxes and city franchise taxes 
during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
total fuel costs were up approximately million during  due primarily to increased generation from higher cost gas fired combustion turbine units at both state line and the energy center 
this increased generation was due to increased customer demand in the third and fourth quarters of  as well as decreased energy availability in the spp during the month of october 
natural gas prices were also higher by during than in total purchased power costs decreased slightly during  due primarily to increased usage of the company s own generation facilities 
unit no 
at the state line power plant was placed in commercial operation on june   and added megawatts of capability 
although asbury underwent an extended five week spring outage in  the plant was back on line ahead of schedule and went on to record a new continuous run record of days and a record availability rate of 
other operating expenses increased during  compared to  due primarily to an increase in production expenses related to the extended asbury plant outage in the spring of maintenance and repairs expense decreased during as a result of decreased levels of distribution system maintenance 
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service during  particularly unit no 
at the state line power plant 
total income taxes increased due to higher taxable income 
other taxes decreased slightly during the year 
nonoperating items total allowance for funds used during construction afudc amounted to approximately of earnings applicable to common stock during  during  and during afudc decreased significantly during as well as  reflecting lower levels of construction work in progress  particularly due to the completion of state line unit no 
interest charges on first mortgage bonds increased million compared to the prior year due to the issuance of million of the company s first mortgage bonds in april  these proceeds were used to repay million of the company s first mortgage bonds due may  and to repay short term indebtedness  including that incurred in connection with the company s construction program 
as a result  commercial paper interest decreased million during the year due to decreased usage of short term debt for financing purposes  while interest income increased  reflecting the higher balances of cash available for investment 
other net deductions increased approximately million during  compared to  due primarily to one time startup costs for the company s non regulated ventures  such as home security and fiber optics leasing 
earnings basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in increased revenue resulted mainly from the unusually warm second and third quarters of the arkansas rate increase and the missouri rate increases also favorably impacted the company s operating results in  as the missouri jurisdiction accounts for approximately of the on system retail sales of the company 
earnings per share of common stock were during compared to in increased revenue  resulting mainly from the increase in missouri rates in  was partially offset by a cool summer and fairly mild winter as well as increases in fuel costs and decreased levels of afudc 
competition federal regulation  such as the national energy policy act of the energy act has promoted and is expected to continue to promote competition in the electric utility industry 
the energy act  among other things  eases restrictions on independent power producers  delegates authority to the ferc to order wholesale wheeling and grants individual states the power to order retail wheeling 
at this time  oklahoma is the only state in which the company operates that has taken any such action 
in missouri  the joint committee of the missouri legislature received testimony during and but there was no legislative action taken 
in kansas  although different bills were introduced into the house and senate during  no legislative action was taken in or in discussions regarding deregulation  however  are expected to continue in missouri and kansas throughout in oklahoma  the electric restructuring act of was passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor 
the bill  with a target date of july   was designed to provide for the orderly restructuring of the electric utility industry in the state and move the state toward open competition for electric generation 
in arkansas  the house and senate passed a concurrent resolution in requesting a study of the impact of competition on the electric utility industry 
legislation has been introduced in arkansas with a target date of in april  the ferc issued order no 
the order which requires all electric utilities that own  operate  or control interstate transmission facilities to file open access tariffs that offer all wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity the same transmission services that they provide themselves 
the utility would have to take service under those tariffs for its own wholesale power transactions 
the order requires a functional unbundling of transmission and power marketing services 
the order also provides stranded cost recovery mechanisms for utilities to recover costs that were incurred to serve wholesale customers that would no longer be recoverable as a result of the customer departing the system and obtaining electric service from another supplier 
in accordance with the order  on july   the company filed its open access transmission tariff the company tariff with the ferc 
following an extensive audit and discussions  the company  the ferc and intervenors reached a settlement on august  the rates submitted with the settlement  applicable to customers who did not have service agreements in effect  were made effective as of july  for customers with service agreements in effect  the company tariff will not be applicable until a rate increase has been filed  which may not be made prior to june on december   the spp filed its own open access transmission tariff the regional tariff on behalf of its members to provide pool wide  short term transmission services using pricing which is based on distance 
as of june   the date the ferc declared the regional tariff effective  the spp began providing short term firm and non firm point to point transmission services for periods of less than one year under this tariff 
the spp  on december   filed proposed revisions to the regional tariff that included the addition of long term point to point transmission service as a service offered under the regional tariff along with a few other minor changes 
the ferc accepted the amended tariff  making it effective january  as to minor changes and effective april  as to the inclusion of the long term transmission services 
a transmission customer taking long term firm point to point transmission service through or out of the spp  will pay one charge for service 
that rate  if the load originates outside the spp  will be a single system wide rate based on the weighted average rate of each spp member s zone through which the load passes 
the rate for each zone is based on such member s rate for long term firm service under its individual open access tariffs 
in addition  if the load originates in a particular member s zone  then the system wide rate will be based solely on such member s rate under its own tariff 
rates for short term transmission services are computed much the same way as for long term transmission services  except that the rates may be discounted by the spp or a particular member  as appropriate 
the regional tariff  as amended  applies to many of the transmission services for which the company tariff was designed 
where that is the case  the company will have to share revenues received from such transmission services with other members of the spp based on a megawatt mile method of calculating transmission service charges 
however  the company tariff will apply instead of the regional tariff to  and the company will receive of the revenues from  all transmission services for which the load originates within the company s zone and does not pass through the zone of any other member of the spp and all long term firm point to point transmission services provided by the company pursuant to contracts entered into prior to april  the availability of purchased power in the bulk power market  generation fuel costs and the requirements of other electric systems are all factors that affect the amount of power purchased and wheeled through the company s and the spp s transmission system each year 
as a result  the company cannot predict the effect of these tariffs on its future operations or financial results due to its inability to predict these factors 
several factors exist which may enhance the company s ability to compete as deregulation occurs 
the company is able to generate and purchase power relatively inexpensively  during  the company s retail rates were approximately less than the electric industry average 
in addition  less than of the company s electric operating revenues are derived from sales to on system wholesale customers  the type of customer for which the ferc is already requiring open access 
at the same time  the company could face increased competitive pressure as a result of its reliance on relatively large amounts of purchased power and its extensive interconnections with neighboring utilities 
the company cannot predict  however  the ultimate effect competition or regulatory change will have on its future operations or financial results  but such effects may be material 
liquidity and capital resources the company s construction related expenditures totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
approximately million of construction expenditures during were related to the state line power plant including advance payments on the new construction planned in connection with the state line project and remaining payments related to the construction of unit no 
at the state line power plant  which was placed in service in mid additions to the company s transmission and distribution systems to accommodate customer growth represented approximately million of construction expenditures during approximately million of the above mentioned construction expenditures for is related to the company s investment in fiber optics cable and equipment which the company plans to utilize and to lease to other entities 
approximately of construction expenditures and other funds requirements for were satisfied internally from operations 
the company estimates that its construction expenditures will total approximately million in  million in and million in of these amounts  the company anticipates that it will spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for additions to the company s distribution system to meet projected increases in customer demand 
these construction expenditure estimates also include approximately million  million and million in  and respectively  for the construction of new generating facilities as part of the state line project discussed in the following paragraph 
the company announced on october  its plans for the construction of a megawatt addition to the state line power plant 
this state line project would consist of an additional combustion turbine  two heat recovery steam generators and a steam turbine and auxiliary equipment 
it is estimated that construction would begin in the fall of and that the state line project would be operational by june the company announced on february  that it had entered into a memorandum of understanding which contemplates entering into a joint ownership agreement under which the company would own an undivided interest in the state line project with western resources owning the remainder 
the company would also be entitled to of the capacity of the state line project 
the company would contribute its existing megawatt state line unit no 
combustion turbine to the state line project  and as a result  upon commercial operation  the state line project would provide the company with megawatts of additional capacity 
the total cost of the state line project is estimated to be million of which million is expected to be the company s share 
the company estimates that internally generated funds will provide approximately of the funds required between and for estimated construction expenditures 
as in the past  in order to finance the additional amounts needed for such construction  the company intends to utilize short term debt and sales of public offerings of long term debt or equity securities  including the sale of the company s common stock pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan and employee stock purchase plan as well as internally generated funds 
the company will continue to utilize short term debt as needed to support normal operations or other temporary requirements 
see note of notes to financial statements regarding the company s line of credit 
on april   the company sold to the public in an underwritten offering million aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds  series due the net proceeds from this sale were added to the company s general funds and were used to repay million of the company s first mortgage bonds  series due may  and to repay short term indebtedness  including indebtedness incurred in connection with the company s construction program 
as of december   the company s ratings for its first mortgage bonds  preferred stock and commercial paper were as follows duff phelps moody s standard poor s first mortgage bonds a a a preferred stock a a bbb commercial paper d p a year year background many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming century change 
as a result  computer systems may fail completely or produce erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
the company is engaged in an on going project to identify  evaluate and implement changes to both information technology it and non it systems in order to achieve year readiness 
the company has also become a member of the edison electric institute s year committee and the electric power research institute s yk embedded systems program in order to assist in the implementation of its year readiness plan 
in addition  the company is participating in the north american electric reliability council s nerc efforts to prepare mission critical systems for year readiness 
nerc s target is to have all mission critical electric power production  transmission  and delivery systems year ready by june  the company is working within that framework and plans to participate in two industry wide year drills on april  and september  the company is using a multi step approach in achieving its year readiness plan 
these steps include creating awareness of the year problem  forming a year task force  developing procedures for documenting year readiness  developing a methodology for the year readiness plan and testing and remediation of year affected items pursuant to the year readiness plan 
developing the methodology for the year readiness plan includes creating and implementing an ongoing communication program with both internal and external parties  performing an inventory of possible year affected items  assessing and prioritizing each such inventory item as to level of criticality  scheduling testing and remediation of such items in order of criticality  and developing contingency planning 
the management consulting firm of sargent lundy has reviewed the process involving the implementation of the year readiness plan as well as the plan itself 
recommendations based on their independent findings will be implemented as a step of the year readiness plan 
the company has purchased a new financial management software package from peoplesoft that is year ready 
the package includes systems for general ledger  accounts payable and asset management  purchasing and inventory  human resources  benefits  time and labor  and payroll  as well as budgeting and project tracking 
in addition  a new customer information system  centurion  is being developed internally which will be year ready 
installation of these systems  which are anticipated to substantially mitigate the company s year exposure  is expected to be completed during the first half of state of readiness a task force has been appointed and is charged with documenting and testing areas of the company which may be affected by the year the targeted areas include general preparation  power generation  energy management systems  telecommunications  substation controls and system protection and business information systems 
within each of these areas  the task force is examining the status of it systems  non it systems and third parties such as vendors  customers and others with whom the company does business 
the inventory of year items was completed in september assessing and prioritizing each item within the year inventory as to the level of criticality was also completed in september the ongoing testing and remediation of the highest level of critical items is scheduled to be completed by the end of the second quarter of the year task force will also develop contingency plans in the event that unanticipated problems are encountered 
these plans are also scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of the company currently plans to substantially complete its year testing and compliance projects by the end of the second quarter of the status of each of the targeted areas undergoing testing is as follows general preparation 
scheduled upgrades to the telephone switch are complete with the final upgrades scheduled to be completed early in the second quarter of the testing of other items is scheduled to be completed by the end of the first quarter of power generation 
the ozark beach plant has completed of the testing of affected equipment 
the testing of affected equipment at the riverton plant is approximately complete and at the energy center plant is complete 
assessment and inventory are complete at all plants 
testing for the asbury and state line plants is underway 
all plants intend to have testing of critical items complete by the end of the first quarter of except for items which can only be tested during scheduled plant shutdowns 
all critical items are anticipated to be tested for year readiness by the end of the second quarter of energy management systems 
the company is in the process of installing major upgrades to its energy management system hardware and software as a result of year related problems observed during preliminary system testing 
these upgrades are anticipated to be completed by the end of the first quarter of the company has obtained readiness certifications for most of the other related components and will conduct its own test on components critical to the operations of the energy management system and other related systems 
year related testing of these components is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of telecommunications 
the company has worked with suppliers and manufacturers to obtain readiness certifications for its various telecommunications systems and components 
the company plans to complete the testing of critical systems and components by the end of the second quarter of substation controls and system protection 
testing of transmission and distribution equipment to date has identified a minor amount of equipment that will require year remediation 
that equipment will be replaced by the end of the second quarter of business information systems 
as previously stated  the new financial management software package from peoplesoft is year ready and the new centurion customer information system  when completed  is expected to be year ready 
as a result of the implementation of the new software packages  several hardware changes are being required throughout the company  delaying testing of the remaining systems 
currently  the testing of these systems is complete with the target date for the completion of testing being mid third parties 
the company is currently in the process of o btaining readiness certifications from third party vendors for all of its core applications and operating systems 
the company expects to complete this process by the end of the first quarter of all critical applications will be tested  however  regardless of whether a certification of readiness has been obtained 
in addition  the company has begun to contact other third parties with whom the company does business such as major customers  power pools  power suppliers  transmission providers and telecommunications providers in order to assess their states of readiness 
this initial contact phase was completed at the end of the company is continuing to monitor the progress of these third parties 
the company is conducting face to face meetings with its most critical suppliers and its largest customers and is corresponding in writing with its other suppliers and customers 
year costs the company currently estimates that total costs which include the costs of the new financial management software package and the new customer information system to update all systems for year readiness will be approximately million  of which approximately million have been incurred and capitalized as of december  and million have been incurred and expensed 
of these capitalized costs  million were included in the capital budget 
costs for specific year remediation projects will be charged to expense while costs to replace software for business purposes other than addressing year issues will be capitalized 
risk assessment and contingency plans at this time  the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that key customers could experience significant reductions in their power needs due to their own year issues  and there could be a temporary disruption of service to some customers due to cascading disruptions caused by other entities whose systems are connected to the company s 
the company is assessing the risk of this scenario and will be formulating contingency plans  currently scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of  to mitigate the potential impact 
the company s year task force has formed a contingency planning team which will follow guidelines established by the nerc to formalize a plan with respect to the above worst case scenario and other contingencies which may develop by the end of the second quarter of the company s readiness plan is designed to provide corrective action with respect to year risks 
if the plan is not successfully carried out in a timely manner  or if unforeseen events occur  year problems could have a material adverse impact on the company 
management does not expect such problems to have such an effect on its financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of significant financing through its issuance of fixed rate debt  commercial paper and preferred stock 
the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposure to a certain percentage of total capitalization  as set by policy  and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
see notes  and of notes to financial statements under item for further information 
if market interest rates average more in than in  the company s interest expense would increase  and income before taxes would decrease  by approximately  this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s commercial paper balances as of december  these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
commodity price risk 
the company is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of coal  natural gas  and electricity and employs established policies and procedures to manage its risks associated with these market fluctuations 
at this time none of the company s commodity purchase or sale contracts meet the definition of financial instruments
