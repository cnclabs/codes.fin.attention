item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
certain factors affecting future operating results the discussions in this form k  including any discussion of or impact  expressed or implied  on the company s anticipated operating results and future earnings  including statements about the company s ability to achieve growth and profitability  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended 
the company s operating results may differ significantly from the results indicated by such forward looking statements 
the company s operating results may be affected by many factors  including but not limited to future changes in export laws or regulations  changes in technology  the effect of foreign political unrest  the ability to hire  retain and motivate technical  management and sales personnel  the risks associated with the technical feasibility and market acceptance of new products  changes in telecommunications protocols  the effects of changing costs  exchange rates and interest 
these and other risks are detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  including this form k for the fiscal year ended october  year compliance update technical communications corporation has been actively addressing the year yk problem since april generally speaking  the yk problem results from the use of two digit  rather than four digit  date years in computer systems and software applications 
today  many systems rely on two or one digits to represent the year portion of a date 
for example  is usually stored as or 
as a result  the year  represented by or  could be interpreted as this type of error could cause problems when systems display  calculate  store and print dates 
the company understands the importance of identifying and solving the yk problem 
as a supplier of mission critical encryption products  the company is committed to providing products that will function  without interruption  into the year in addition  technical communications corporation is taking proactive steps to ensure that all critical systems  from both an internal and external perspective  are reviewed and  if necessary  corrected 
company s state of readiness the company has divided its yk efforts into three major areas i products and customers  ii enterprise business systems and information technology and iii external systems and suppliers 
the review of each area will consist of an inventory of potentially affected systems  an assessment of yk readiness and corrective action deployment 
as of october   the company has completed all of its yk efforts in the areas described above with the exception of our internal telephone system 
the company has tested all of its current products for yk problems 
a product is deemed yk compliant if the product  when used in accordance with its associated documentation  is capable of processing  receiving  and or providing data within or between the th and st centuries  provided that all other products used in conjunction with the product in question properly exchange date data with that product 
it should be noted that certain tcc products deemed to be yk compliant might require a service update in order to achieve yk compliant status 
although no assurances can be given  the company believes that all current products are either yk compliant  or can be made yk compliant with minor adjustments or software upgrades 
this product assessment has identified date related issues with certain older products that the company no longer manufactures or sells 
it is the company s intent to offer upgrades or alternative products where reasonably practicable 
in some cases  the company sells encryption systems that interact with third party products or operate with computer systems not under the company s control 
there can be no assurances that such third party equipment will function correctly into the year the company s internal yk initiative includes a review of all computer hardware and software related systems including  internal lan  product development tools  facility operations  interfaces with third parties via edi links and desktop systems 
as of october   all internal systems have been reviewed and evaluated 
except for the item noted above  all internal systems are now yk compliant 
the remaining item will be upgraded by december  the company s enterprise information system  which includes manufacturing  financial accounting and sales administration  is year compliant 
at this time  the company does not anticipate that any internal system will create a substantive disruption in the company s operation into the year the yk external systems review process consists of identifying and contacting suppliers and service providers that are believed to be significant to the company s business operations 
the company has reviewed each key supplier and service provider s yk readiness based on its formal response to a tcc yk status request 
as a result  the company does not foresee any disruption in the flow of goods and services 
this process is ongoing and is expected to continue into the year costs to address the company s year issues as of october   the main portion of these costs relates to the evaluation and testing of products for yk compliance 
the company anticipates additional costs of approximately  in order to complete the yk process 
there can be no assurances that the company will not encounter unexpected costs or delays in achieving year compliance 
risks of the company s year issues based on current information  the company believes that the year problem will not have a material adverse effect on the company s overall business and financial condition 
since all current products are either yk compliant or can be made yk compliant  future sales of all such products do not represent a yk risk to the company 
even though the company is adopting a proactive strategy  there can be no assurances that year problems will not have any impact on the business 
despite efforts to ensure that products will function correctly into the year  the company may see an increase in warranty and other claims  especially those related to older products or products that incorporate third party software or hardware 
if any of the company s material suppliers or service providers experience unforeseen yk issues  the company s production  product development  and operations may also be materially adversely effected 
company s contingency plan the company is working diligently to minimize the risks associated with yk issues 
the company plans to dedicate appropriate resources to address all known yk related issues  including potential catastrophic failures due to loss of electricity  security systems  heating systems  etc 
such action may include the use of alternative sources of supply to support manufacturing and product development 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the years ended october  and october   were  and  respectively

gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales was in as compared to for the same period in fiscal year the disparity between the two fiscal years is attributed to the negative impact of a higher percentage of fixed costs due to the lower sales volume and the sale of a less favorable mix of lower margin products during selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended october  and were  for fiscal year this decrease of was primarily attributable to a decrease of  in payroll and travel related costs and contract services support  associated with the lower sales volume and the continued emphasis on expense controls 
in addition  there was a decrease in legal fees of  attributed to the settlement of most litigation in early and a reduction in bad debt expense of  due to the completion of a major contract in  which required substantial coverage 
these decreased costs were offset by an increase in product demonstration costs of  and commissions to third party representatives of  product development costs for the year ended october  were  compared to  for the same period in fiscal this increase of was attributable to the continued commitment to new product development  particularly the cipher x series product line  and lower volume of billable development contracts

government agencies 
gross profit for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales was in fiscal compared to in the prior year  which was primarily due to improved product mix and tighter cost controls 
product development costs in fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal the  or  decrease is attributable in part to charging more support engineering costs directly to the aforementioned customized systems orders and the capitalization of certain software development costs related to the company s keynet product 
in addition  outside product development costs were sharply reduced by focusing engineering design developments on selected products and by bringing most of these efforts in house 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly from  in fiscal to  for the year just ended  primarily due to significantly lower marketing and business development expenditures reflecting more realistic new product introduction schedules  largely offset by increased sales support costs and higher legal expenses related to the aforementioned litigation 
investment income earned during fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal the decrease was largely the result of increased working capital requirements associated with the aforementioned large foreign contract  which was not shipped until the fourth quarter of fiscal the company attained a net profit of  or
