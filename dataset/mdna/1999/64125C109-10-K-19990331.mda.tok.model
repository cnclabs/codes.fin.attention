item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of neurocrine biosciences  inc neurocrine or the company  as well as the preceding sections of this annual report on form k  contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties  pertaining generally to the expected continuation of the company s collaborative agreements  the receipt of research payments thereunder  the future achievement of various milestones in product development and the receipt of payments related thereto  the potential receipt of royalty and profit sharing payments  the anticipated dates of commencement of selection of development candidates and the commencement of clinical trials  the successful continuation of the company s research and development programs and the potential development of future products  the period of time the company s existing capital resources will meet its funding requirements  and the company s financial results of operations 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth below  and those outlined in the business section of item overview since the founding of the company in january  neurocrine has been engaged in the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products for diseases and disorders of the central nervous and immune systems 
to date  neurocrine has not generated any revenues from the sale of products  and does not expect to generate any product revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s revenues are expected to come from its strategic alliances 
neurocrine has incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million as of december  and expects to incur additional operating losses in the future  which are potentially greater than losses in prior years 
results of operations the company s revenue from collaborative research and development agreements was million for the year ended december  compared with million in  and million in the decline in revenues compared to revenues resulted primarily from non recurring revenues related to the completion of the sponsored research portion of the janssen collaboration  a one time research support payment received under the eli lilly collaboration  sponsored development payments received under the novartis collaboration and the timing of milestone achievements received under all three collaborations 
revenues in included million of sponsored development received from the company s canadian affiliate  npi 
the increase in revenues compared to revenues resulted primarily to increased sponsored research  license fees and milestone revenues recognized under the janssen  novartis and eli lilly collaborations 
research and development expenses increased to million during compared with million in and million in these increases reflect higher costs associated with the addition of scientific personnel and costs to advance compounds into preclinical and clinical trials 
the company expects to incur significant increases in future periods as compounds are advanced through the clinical development process 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during compared with million in and million in these increases resulted primarily from additional administrative personnel  business development and professional service expenses to support the expanded clinical development efforts 
the company anticipates slight increases in general and administrative expenses over the next few years as the company s clinical efforts continue to expand 
during  the company wrote off acquired in process research and development costs of million 
in may  the company acquired the assets  liabilities and the in process research and development programs of northwest neurologic  inc nnl in exchange for company s common stock and stock options valued at million 
the acquired in process research and development consisted of melanocortin mcr  a brain receptor technology relating to obesity and excitatory amino acid transporters eaats  a technology relating to neurodegeneration and stroke 
in june  the company purchased licenses for the use of technology in programs relating to insomnia nbi from dov pharmaceuticals and brain cancer il fusion toxin from the national institute of health for  the acquired in process research and development projects and the licensed technologies are in the early stages of development  have not reached technological feasibility and have no known alternative uses 
the nature and efforts required to develop the acquired in process research and development into commercially viable products include completion of the development stages of a compound  pre clinical development  clinical trial testing  fda approval and commercialization 
due to the nature of the pharmaceutical development process  the company anticipates incurring substantial costs to develop the compounds into products 
however  there is no certainty that any of these development efforts will result in commercially viable products 
during the upcoming fiscal year  the company anticipates research and development expenditures of million for eaats  million for mcr  million for il fusion toxin and million for nbi the value of the acquired in process research and development was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to such products  including costs to complete the development  and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value using a discount factor of 
the resulting projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
management also reviewed the probability of product success  which were estimated using certain probability factors for each stage of development 
interest income increased to million during compared with million for and million in the increase over primarily resulted from higher effective interest yields on the company s investment portfolio during the increase over primarily resulted from higher effective interest yields in addition to higher average cash balances throughout the year 
management anticipates lower interest income in future periods as clinical efforts increase operating requirements and cash available for investment declines 
equity in npi losses recorded in were million compared with million in in addition to the equity in npi losses during  the company recorded a write down in the value of its investment in npi  totaling million 
net loss for was million or per share compared to net income of million or per share for and million or per share in management expects to incur substantial operating losses in future periods as its clinical development efforts continue to grow 
to date  the company s revenues have come principally from funded research and achievements of milestones under corporate collaborations 
the nature and amount of these revenues from period to period may lead to substantial fluctuations in the results of year to date revenues and earnings 
accordingly  results and earnings of one period are not predictive of future periods 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
the company invests its excess cash primarily in investment grade debt instruments  marketable debt securities of us government agencies and high grade commercial paper 
management has established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that maintain safety and liquidity 
the primary market risk associated with such investments is vulnerability to changes in short term and long term us prime interest rates

in february  the company entered into a three year collaborative research and development agreement with janssen for the development of crf receptor antagonists for the treatment of anxiety  depression and substance abuse 
janssen paid the company million and million for sponsored research during and  respectively 
milestone payments totaled  million and million during  and  respectively 
the collaborative research portion of the agreement was completed as scheduled in with the selection of a clinical candidate and the commencement of clinical trials in europe 
the company may continue to receive milestone payments and royalties upon the successful continuation of the development portion of the agreement 
in january  the company entered into an agreement with novartis to develop altered peptide ligands for the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
novartis paid the company for license fees and research funding totaling million  million and during  and  respectively 
milestone payments were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in march  the company participated in the formation of a research and development company  neuroscience pharma  inc npi  with a group of canadian investors 
at the same time  the company entered into a sponsored research agreement with npi 
the terms of the agreement called for npi to fund additional research efforts on technologies licensed to npi by the company 
during  the company recognized million in revenues associated with costs of research on the neurogenomics and dhea programs 
in may  the company purchased two adjacent parcels of land in san diego for approximately million in cash 
one parcel was sold to science park center  llc 
llc  of which the company owns a minority interest  in exchange for a note receivable of million plus interest 
however  for accounting purposes  this transaction does not qualify as a sale under sfas no 
and therefore  the entire amount of the note receivable is included in land 
the amount included in land at december  and was million and million  respectively 
during  the llc constructed an expanded laboratory and office complex on the property and leased the facility to the company under a year operating lease 
the company has the option to purchase the facility at any time during the lease at a predetermined price 
the company will hold the remaining parcel until such time as the company s growth requires additional expansion 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with interest income and future payments due under the strategic alliances  will be sufficient to satisfy its current and projected funding requirements at least through the year however  no assurance can be given that such capital resources and payments will be sufficient to conduct its research and development programs as planned 
the amount and timing of expenditures will vary depending upon a number of factors  including progress of the company s research and development programs 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its investments in certain available for sale securities and secondarily from its long term debt 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the company s investments are primarily in fixed income  investment grade securities and are not restricted 
the investment policy emphasizes return on principal and liquidity and is focused on fixed returns  which limit volatility and risk of principal 
at december   the company had available for sale securities of million 
interest risk exposure on long term debt relates to the company s note payable which bears of floating interest rate of prime plus one quarter percent at december  
at december   the note balance was approximately  payable in equal monthly installments through january the company believes that a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially effect the fair value of interest sensitive financial instruments nor the costs associated with the long term debt 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on recent assessments  the company determined that it will not be required to modify or replace significant portions of hardware and software so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications and replacement of existing hardware and software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date the company has fully completed its assessment of all systems that could be significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems are year compliant 
that assessment did  however  indicated that software and hardware embedded chips used in some scientific equipment were at risk 
affected systems include several robotics systems used for high through put screening 
the company is currently assessing cost comparisons on whether to remediate or replace this equipment and expects to have the equipment corrected and re tested by may  the company has gathered information about the year compliance status of its significant suppliers and contractors and continues to monitor their compliance 
for its information technology exposures  to date the company is complete on the remediation phase and expects to complete software reprogramming and replacement no later than april  to date  the company has completed of its testing and has implemented of its remediated systems for its scientific equipment 
the remediation phase for all significant systems is expected to be complete by may   with all remediated systems fully tested by june  the company has queried its important suppliers and contractors that do not share information systems with the company external agents 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test and implement the software and scientific equipment for year modifications 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at approximately  and is being funded through operating cash flows and capital equipment financing 
to date  the company has incurred approximately  related to all phases of the year project 
of the total remaining project costs  approximately  is attributable to the purchase of new software   for new scientific equipment  which will be capitalized  and  for the repair of hardware and software 
the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including continued availability of certain resources  and other factors 
estimates on the status of completion and the expected completion dates are based on costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
the company has not completed a formal contingency plan for non compliance  but it is developing a plan based on the information obtained from third parties and an on going evaluation of the company s own systems 
the company anticipates having a contingency plan in place by mid  which will include development of backup procedures  identification of alternate suppliers and possible increases in supplies inventory levels 
the company has not identified its most reasonably likely worst case scenario with respect to possible losses in connection with year related problems 
the company plans on completing this analysis in mid the information above contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements relating to the company s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions  and adequate resources that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of readers are cautioned that forward looking statements about the year should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading caution on forward looking statements 
caution on forward looking statements the company s business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to  the risks inherent in its research and development activities  including the successful continuation of the company s strategic collaborations  the successful completion of clinical trials  the lengthy  expensive and uncertain process of seeking regulatory approvals  uncertainties associated both with the potential infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties  and with obtaining and enforcing its own patents and patent rights  uncertainties regarding government reforms and of product pricing and reimbursement levels  technological change and competition  manufacturing uncertainties and dependence on third parties 
even if the company s product candidates appear promising at an early stage of development  they may not reach the market for numerous reasons 
such reasons include the possibilities that the product will be ineffective or unsafe during clinical trials  will fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale  will be uneconomical to market or will be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties 
neurocrine will require additional funding for the continuation of its research and product development programs  for progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  for operating expenses  for the pursuit of regulatory approvals for its product candidates  for the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  if any  the cost of product in licensing and any possible acquisitions  and may require additional funding for establishing manufacturing and marketing capabilities in the future 
the company may seek to access the public or private equity markets whenever conditions are favorable 
the company may also seek additional funding through strategic alliances and other financing mechanisms  potentially including off balance sheet financing 
there can be no assurance that adequate funding will be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to curtail significantly one or more of its research or development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others 
this may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or product candidates 
continued profitability is not expected as the company s operating expenses are anticipated to rise significantly in future periods as products are advanced through the various development and clinical stages 
neurocrine expects to incur additional operating expenses over the next several years as its research  development  preclinical testing and clinical trial activities increase 
to the extent that the company is unable to obtain third party funding for such expenses  the company expects that increased expenses will result in increased losses from operations 
there can be no assurance that the company s products under development will be successfully developed or that its products  if successfully developed  will generate revenues sufficient to enable the company to earn a profit
