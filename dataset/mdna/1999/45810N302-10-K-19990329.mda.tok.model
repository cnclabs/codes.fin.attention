in october  the company paid approximately  of convertible preferred stock dividend payments which had been in arrears 
as of december   there were no payments in arrears 
year issue the company s management has recognized the need to ensure that its operations and relationships with its vendors and other third parties will not be adversely impacted by software processing errors arising from calculations using the year and beyond yk 
as such  the company has appointed a yk task force to identify and assess the risks associated with its information systems and operations  and its interactions with vendors and third party insurance payors the yk project 
the yk project is comprised of five phases as follows identification of risks  assessment of risks  development of remediation and contingency plans  implementation and testing 
the company has identified the yk risks and is approximately complete in assessing these risks 
the last three phases are being done in parallel as opposed to sequential order 
the company believes that the yk risks associated with its information systems and certain medical equipment may be potentially significant 
in nearly all cases  the company is relying on assurances from third party vendors that certain information systems and medical equipment will be yk compliant 
in addition  in the normal course of business  the company has made capital investments in certain vendor supplied software applications and hardware systems to address the financial and operational needs of the business 
these systems  which will improve the efficiencies and productivity of the replaced systems  have been represented to be yk compliant by the vendors and have been or will be installed by november the company has tested  is currently testing or will have tested such vendor supplied systems and equipment  but cannot be sure that its tests will be adequate or that  if problems are identified  they will be addressed in a timely and satisfactory way 
the company is also highly dependent upon receiving payments from third party payors for insurance reimbursement for claims submitted by the managed medical practices  and as such  the ability of such payors to process claims submitted by medical practices accurately and timely  constitutes a significant risk to the company s cash flow 
individual network sites have been or will be in communication with these payors throughout the country to insure that these payors will be yk compliant and will be able to process the medical practices claims uninterrupted 
in addition  the company deals with numerous financial institutions  all of whom have indicated that the yk compliance issue is being addressed proactively and should not present a problem on or after january  as the company and its managed medical practices are primarily reliant on third party vendors and payors to be yk compliant  the company does not anticipate that it will incur a material incremental cost associated with addressing yk problems 
to date  all of the company s capital projects regarding information systems were part of its long term capital strategic plan 
the timing of implementation of these capital projects was not accelerated as a result of the yk issue  with the exception of the timing of the installation of a new financial system at the fci network site which was accelerated from the year to the company estimates that it will incur an aggregate cost of  related to the yk project as follows i approximately  related to computer hardware and software and medical equipment replacements and upgrades  of which approximately will be capitalizable due to the added value of such replacements and upgrades  ii approximately  of non incremental employee opportunity costs for time spent by information systems and yk task force employees which would have ordinarily been spent elsewhere  and iii approximately  in incremental staffing costs 
by accelerating the implementation of the new financial system at the fci network site  approximately  of capitalizable equipment and software costs and approximately  of training costs will be incurred in instead of the year in the event any third parties cannot timely provide the company with information systems  equipment or services that meet the yk requirements  the company s ability and that of its managed medical practices to offer services and to process sales  and the company s cash flows  could be disrupted 
in addition  if the company fails to satisfactorily resolve yk issues related to its operations in a timely manner  it could be exposed to liability  particularly to the managed medical practices and their patients 
as developed to date  the company s contingency plan provides for the following i stockpiling higher than normal inventories of critical supplies  ii ensuring an adequate line of bank credit if third party payor payments are disrupted  and iii ensuring all critical staff are available or scheduled for work prior to  during and immediately after december  management believes that the company is taking reasonable and adequate measures to address yk issues 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s information systems  medical equipment and other non information technology systems will be yk compliant on or before december   or that vendors and third party insurance payors are  or will be  yk compliant  or that the costs required to address the yk issue will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
like virtually every company  and indeed every aspect of contemporary society  the company is at risk for the failure of major infrastructure providers to adequately address potential yk problems 
the company is highly dependent on a variety of public and private infrastructure providers to conduct its business in numerous jurisdictions throughout the country 
failures of the banking system  basic utility providers  telecommunication providers and other services  as a result of yk problems  could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to conduct its business 
while the company is cognizant of these risks  a complete assessment of all such risks is beyond the scope of the company s yk project or ability of the company to address 
the company has focused its resources and attention on the most immediate and controllable yk risks
