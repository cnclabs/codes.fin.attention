the company may seek to obtain additional capital through debt or equity offerings  encumbering properties  entering into arrangements whereby certain costs of development will be paid by others to earn an interest in the properties  or sale of a portion of the company s interest in the karakuduk field 
the present environment for financing the acquisition of oil and gas properties or the ongoing obligations of the oil and gas business is uncertain due  in part  to instability in oil and gas pricing in recent years 
the company s small size and the early stage of development of the karakuduk field may also increase the difficulty in raising any financing that may be needed in the future 
there can be no assurance that the debt or equity financing that might be required to fund the company s operations and obligations in the future will be available to the company on economically acceptable terms if at all 
during the first quarter of  the company borrowed an additional  from related party investors 
the notes are repayable in full on august  and accrue interest at an rate 
the financing was primarily utilized to fund kkm s operations during the first quarter of the company s financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the company has incurred recurring operating losses and has no operating assets presently generating cash to fund its operating and capital requirements 
the company does not anticipate that its current cash reserves and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements through fiscal as of december   substantially all of the company s assets are invested in the development of the karakuduk field 
the karakuduk field has not produced any revenues as of december  and is not expected to produce revenues sufficient to meet kkm s cash needs during the development of the karakuduk field  through kkm  will require substantial amounts of additional capital 
kkm s revised license with the government required kkm to expend million as of december  and another million as of december  total expenditure commitments  from the commencement of operations through december   of  have been satisfied by kkm 
kkm has an additional expenditure commitment of million for the year ending december   of which kkm has spent approximately million as of april  the expenditure commitment is expected to be spent primarily for kkm s drilling operations and completion of the field facilities capable of sustaining expected future production from the karakuduk field  along with general overhead expenses 
without additional funding and significant revenues from oil sales  of which there are no assurances  the company will not be able to provide necessary funds to kkm in order to satisfy these requirements 
as a result  the company s interest in the karakuduk field may be lost 
the company received an extension to june   from the overseas private investment corp 
opic for political risk insurance 
opic granted the company a binding executed letter of commitment on september  the company has a standby facility for which it has made eight payments of  and another two payments of  the company expects to execute the contract on or before june  year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has addressed the availability and integrity of financial systems and the reliability of operational systems 
the company has specifically reviewed the status of readiness for the year for it s management and financial reporting systems in the us and in kazakhstan  and believes the systems are year compliant 
the company does not expect to incur any material operating expenses or be required to make significant investment in computer system improvements to become year compliant 
third party systems that expose the company to risk are primarily those surrounding the company s equity investee  kkm 
management has begun communications with kkm regarding their readiness for the year and is currently assisting kkm to formalize an evaluation and assessment process 
kkm has completed a partial assessment and currently believes that the computer systems it has in place are year compliant 
kkm has initiated formal communication with all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
in particular  it is unclear as to the extent the kazakh government and other organizations who provide significant infrastructure services within the kazakh republic have addressed the year issue 
furthermore  the current crisis in russia and the cis could adversely affect the ability of the government and such organizations to fund adequate year compliance programs 
there is no guarantee that the systems of the government or of other organizations on which the company and kkm rely will be timely converted and will not have an adverse effect on the company and its systems 
the most likely worst case scenario the company can foresee from a failure of internal or third party systems would include an inability of vendors to timely deliver required materials  supplies  or services to the karakuduk field necessary to conduct drilling or other field operations 
in order to mitigate the possibility of timely delivery of critical materials and supplies  kkm can fully stock materials to sustain drilling operations over the transition period from december through the first quarter of the at this time  kkm will assess if any critical vendors are having difficulties due to year issues 
kkm has an extensive selection of vendors for all types of materials and service needs 
if certain vendors cannot perform on a timely basis  kkm will simply utilize a different service provider 
furthermore  a breakdown of the existing kaztransoil pipeline required by kkm to export oil outside of kazakhstan would seriously delay or even halt kkm s ability to sell oil 
kkm management has performed physical inspections of the kaztransoil pipeline and do not foresee any problems with placing production into the pipeline and properly recording the volumes attributable to kkm 
there are no assurances  however  that problems will not occur at different points along the pipeline  inside or outside of kazakhstan  including points of destination for the throughput 
due to the limited transportation options for marketing crude oil within kazakhstan and the cis  kkm will not be able to avoid the negative consequences associated with a breakdown in the export pipeline if it should occur 
the management of kkm  however  considers this likelihood to be remote

as of december   the company held a equity interest in kkm 
general and administrative costs increased by  from the year ended december  due mainly to the company s increase in compensation expense and legal fees
