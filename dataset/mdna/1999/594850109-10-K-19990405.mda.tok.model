item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk related factors set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
results of operations overview micro linear corporation was founded in micro linear currently serves the communications  industrial and computer markets with a broad range of standard products for a variety of applications  including local area networks  mass storage  video  telecommunications  power management  battery management  motor control and data conversion 
the company utilizes three principal manufacturing process technologies  bipolar  cmos and bicmos 
in recent years  sales of communications products have constituted a majority of the company s revenues 
specifically  such products represented approximately  and of net revenues for   and  respectively 
the communications market is characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and rapid technological change 
in addition  the communications market has undergone rapid growth and consolidation in the last few years 
the company s net revenues and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in the event of a slowdown in this market 
the company is attempting to reduce its dependency on the communications industry through various means  such as expanding its product mix and customer base 
the company s communications market includes networking applications 
a substantial portion of the company s net revenues are derived from sales of products for computer networking applications 
sales of the company s products to network equipment manufacturers accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues in and accounted for of the company s top selling products for these products constituted approximately of the company s revenues for the same period 
the computer networking equipment market is characterized by intense competition relatively short product life cycles and rapid technological change 
in addition  the computer network equipment market has undergone a period of rapid growth and experienced consolidation among the competitors in the market place in recent years 
although the company has expanded its product mix and customer base  the company expects its dependency on sales to network equipment manufacturers to continue into the company s business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant slowdown in the computer networking equipment market 
in addition  as a result of competitive pricing pressures  the company has experienced lower margins in certain of its existing and recently introduced products for computer networking applications 
there can be no assurance as to when or if such pricing pressure will lessen 
such pricing pressures will have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations unless they can be offset by higher margins on other products or reduced operating expenses 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and other fluctuations which may result from the timing and extent of process development costs  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  the availability and cost of wafers from outside foundries  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  and competitive pricing pressures 
other factors which may result in operating fluctuations are the company s ability to access advanced process technologies  the ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the timing of new product announcements and cyclical semiconductor industry conditions 
moreover  the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  the company expects to continue to experience material fluctuations in its future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
annual results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest income expense  net income before provision for taxes provision for taxes on income net income net revenues net revenues were million for  million for and million for net revenues in decreased over net revenues in and net revenues increased over the company serves three principal markets  computer  communications and industrial 
net revenues for compared to increased in the industrial market and decreased in the communications market and in the computer market 
net revenues for compared to increased in the communications market  in the industrial market and decreased in the computer market 
the communications market includes the computer networking equipment networking sub market 
sales of products to the networking market constitute a majority of the companys net revenues 
revenues in the networking sub market for were million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  for and million  or of net revenues  for the networking sub market is characterized by intense competition  relatively short product life cycles and rapid technological change 
in addition  the networking sub market has undergone a period of rapid growth  price erosion and consolidation in recent years 
although the company has expanded its product mix and customer base  the company expects its dependency on sales to network equipment manufacturers to continue for the immediate future 
the company s business and results of operations have in the past and will in the future be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant slowdown in the computer networking equipment market 
international revenues for totaled million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  for and million  or of net revenues  for the decrease in international revenues in absolute dollars in compared to was due to the combination of lower direct product demand for the company s products in asia and decreased asia pacific subcontract work for domestic customers 
the increase in international revenues in absolute dollars in compared to was due to stronger demand for the company s products in asia and europe 
despite the lower product demand in asia through the end of  the company does not expect any disproportionate direct negative impact as a result of future financial and stock market dislocations that have occurred in the asian financial markets  as the majority of the company s asia pacific business is subcontract work for domestic customers 
domestic distributor revenues were approximately of net revenues for  compared to for each of and in july  the company added a third national domestic distributor 
the company defers recognition of revenue derived from sales to domestic distributors until such distributors resell the products to their customers 
revenue is recognized by the company upon shipment to international representatives  but the gross margin on these shipments is deferred until international distributors notify the company of product sales to end users 
gross margin the company s gross margin is affected by the volume of product sales  price  product mix  manufacturing utilization  product yields and the mix of sales to oem s and to distributors 
gross margin has been and will continue to be periodically affected by expenses incurred in connection with start up and installation of new process technologies at outside manufacturing foundries 
the company s gross margin declined to in from in and in  primarily due to a shift of product mix to lower margin products  lower levels of production and lower average selling prices related to competitive pricing pressures  especially in the communications market 
the company s gross margin is adversely impacted by the costs associated with installing new processes at its foundries 
although the company has recently been able to mitigate the adverse impact on gross margin associated with new wafer manufacturing process costs by relying upon process technologies existing at its outside wafer foundries  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to incur significant expenses in the future to develop  or obtain access to  advanced process technologies and to transfer and install such technologies at one or more of its foundries  which could have a material adverse effect on gross margin in the future 
the company currently purchases its wafers from six wafer suppliers 
a substantial majority of the company s wafer supply is obtained from three wafer suppliers 
the company s products are assembled and packaged by four vendors 
any delays or interruptions due to such factors as inadequate capacity or unavailable raw materials in the company s wafer suppliers or assembly vendors could materially and adversely affect product shipments 
the company purchases nearly all of its bicmos wafers from two wafer foundries  the majority of which are supplied by one wafer foundry in taiwan 
although both wafer foundries are qualified to supply the company with bicmos wafers  the company s short term bicmos wafer supply could be materially and adversely affected if the wafer foundry in taiwan is unable to meet the company s wafer supply requirements 
the company closed its internal bipolar fabrication facility in the fourth quarter of production related to this fabrication facility has been moved to an outside foundry and will result in lower wafer costs 
the total cost of the closing on the company s internal bipolar fabrication facility  including clean up and qualification of the new fabrication facility was approximately million and was expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs associated with the definition  design and development of standard and semi standard products  tile arrays and standard cells 
in addition  research and development expenses include test development and prototype assembly costs associated with new product development 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success 
research and development expenses such as mask and silicon costs that are related to the development of new products can fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the product design process 
research and development expenses were million for  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in were flat with the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in compared to is primarily attributable to the addition of personnel associated with the company s development center in cambridge  england 
in the first quarter of  the company announced its intention to establish a development center in livingston  scotland 
the first managing director for the livingston location was hired in january and the company expects to add additional development engineers in cambridge and livingston throughout the remainder of the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects that research and development expenses will increase in the future in absolute dollars 
such expenses fluctuated as a percentage of net revenues primarily due to changes in revenue 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in absolute dollars in compared to is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales commissions due to lower net revenues and decreased business conference costs 
the increase in absolute dollars in compared to is primarily attributable to higher staffing levels  an increase in sales commissions due to higher net revenues  increased business conference costs  and increased professional fees 
the company expects additional spending increases in absolute dollars in selling  general and administrative expenses in the future 
such expenses fluctuated as a percentage of net revenues primarily due to changes in revenue 
in fiscal  the company recorded an approximately  severance charge for the former chief executive officer   of this amount was related to modifications of option terms 
interest and other income and interest expense interest and other income was million for  million for and million for interest income is affected by changes in the company s cash balances as well as prevailing interest rates 
interest expense was million for each of  and provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rates for  and were which differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes  net of federal research credits 
liquidity and capital resources since  the company has financed its operations and capital requirements principally through cash flow from operations and the proceeds from its initial public offering in october operations provided million of net cash during  a decrease of million over the decrease in cash from operations is primarily attributable to lower net income  increased deferred tax assets and decreased accounts payable partially offset by lower accounts receivable  inventory and accrued liabilities balances at the end of cash used in investing activities for is attributable to capital expenditures of million and the net purchase of short term investments of million 
the company currently expects capital expenditures to be approximately million in and as of december  had capital commitments for of approximately million 
financing activities for consist primarily of the repurchase of the company s common stock for million 
from january through the end of  the board of directors approved the repurchase of an aggregate of million of the company s common stock in stock repurchase programs 
through january   the company has repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
subsequent to year end  the company had repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock for million as of january  the company also generated million of proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock option and purchase plans 
working capital amounted to million as of december  and includes cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
the company anticipates that its existing cash resources and cash generated from operations will fund necessary purchases of capital equipment and provide adequate working capital for at least the next twelve months 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  including  among others  the extent to which the company pursues additional wafer fabrication capacity from existing foundry suppliers or new suppliers  capital expenditures  and the level of the company s product development efforts  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require the company to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
other factors affecting future operating results the company s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect revenues and profitability  including the company s access to advanced process technologies  the timing and extent of process development costs  the company s ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the volume and timing of orders received  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in the mix of products sold  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  the availability and cost of wafers from outside foundries  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  competitive pricing pressures and cyclical semiconductor industry conditions 
a majority of the company s net revenues are derived from sales of a limited number of products 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry have decreased over the life of any particular product 
competitive pricing pressures are expected to continue in the future  especially in the communications market  and may have a material adverse effect on the company s gross margin 
the company s business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
due to the absence of substantial noncancellable backlog  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
to remain competitive  the company must develop or obtain access to advanced semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce die size  increase die performance and functional complexity  and improve yields 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development 
if the company is unable to develop or obtain access to advanced wafer processing technologies as they become needed  or is unable to define  design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  its future operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if the company is unable to transfer and install such new process technologies to one or more of its foundries in a timely manner  its business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the company s market diversification and product development activities have placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on the company s limited personnel and other resources 
the company s ability to manage any future growth effectively will require it to integrate its new employees into its overall operations  to continue to improve its operational  financial and management systems and to attract  train  motivate and manage its employees successfully 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
the industry has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions 
the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors 
year readiness disclosure the year issue arises because most computer systems and programs were designed to handle only a two digit year  not a four digit year 
when the year begins  these computers may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
the company has commenced  for all of its information systems  a year date conversion project to address all necessary code changes  testing and implementation and accordingly does not anticipate any internal year issues from its own information systems  databases or programs 
the company has also commenced on a year date conversion project to address machinery  equipment and other items used in the operations of the company 
the company has a comprehensive year project designed to identify and assess the risks associated with its information systems  products  operations and infrastructure  and suppliers that are not year compliant  and to develop  implement  and test remediation and contingency plans to mitigate these risks 
the project comprises four phases identification of risks  assessment of risks  development of remediation and contingency plans  and implementation and testing 
in addition  the company provides its customers with information on the year project and the progress made towards year compliance 
information systems 
the company s current enterprise information system has been remediated and was fully tested in may and determined to be year compliant 
the required changes to the company s information systems and items used in the operations of the company are expected to be completed by the end of june based on the current status of the assessments and remediation plans made to date  the company expects total year related external costs pertaining to its information systems to be between  and  of such amount  approximately  has been spent to date 
none of the company s other information technology projects have been deferred as a result of the company s year compliance efforts 
products 
the company has assessed the capabilities of all of its products sold to customers 
based on the assessments made to date none of the company s products are affected by year issues 
operations and infrastructure 
machinery and equipment and other items used in the operations and facilities of the company have been inventoried and are currently being assessed for year compliance 
the assessment to date has not yielded any major areas of concern 
the assessment process was completed in september in june  the company started to develop remediation plans 
based on the assessments and remediation plans made to date  the company expects year related external costs pertaining to its operations and infrastructure to range between  and  suppliers 
the company continues to evaluate its supplier base to determine whether year issues affecting suppliers will adversely impact the company s operations 
the company has recently completed an assessment of its key suppliers 
although the company does not anticipate any business disruptions based on the assurances made by these suppliers  the company will continue to assess and monitor key suppliers through the year transition period 
customers 
the company established a global year desk at its headquarters in california to handle all customer requests for compliance and survey information  and for other general information related to the company s year programs 
general and risk factors 
although the company expects that the year project will be completed in a timely manner to prevent any significant disruptions of business  unforeseen risks and delays may cause disruption in manufacturing  order processing and distribution services or lead to additional costs 
the company believes that its greatest potential risks for year issues are associated with its information systems and systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure  for which the company is continuing to review and evaluate the need of contingency planning that may be required 
internal costs incurred for the year project are being tracked  they principally consist of payroll and related costs 
the company does not currently expect the total costs to be material  and it expects to be able to fund the total costs through operating cash flows 
however  the company has not yet completed all of its assessments  developed remediation or contingency plans for all problems  or completely implemented or tested its remediation plans 
as the year project continues  the company may discover additional year problems  may not be able to develop  implement  or test remediation or contingency plans  or may find that the costs of these activities exceed current expectations and become material 
in many cases  the company is relying on assurances from suppliers that new and upgraded information systems and other products will be year compliant 
the company plans to test certain third party products  but cannot be sure that its tests will be adequate or that  if problems are identified  they will be addressed by the supplier in a timely and satisfactory way 
because the company uses a variety of information systems and has additional systems embedded in its operations and infrastructure  the company cannot be sure that all of its systems will work together in a year compliant fashion 
furthermore  the company cannot be sure that it will not suffer business interruptions  either because of its own year problems or those of its customers or suppliers whose year problems may make it difficult or impossible for them to fulfill their commitments to the company 
if the company fails to satisfactorily resolve year issues in a timely manner  it could be exposed to claims by third parties 
the company is evaluating the various types of contingency plans such as procedures for dealing with disruptions of internal business systems  plans for factory shutdowns and identification of alternative material vendors in the event of year related disruption in supply 
contingency evaluation and planning will continue through  and will depend heavily on the results of the remediation and testing of critical systems 
the company cannot assure that any contingency plans in effect at the time of a system failure will adequately address the immediate or long term effects of a failure  or that such a failure would not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial results in spite of prudent planning 
the company could be adversely impacted by year issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
the company is continuing to evaluate year related risks and corrective actions 
at this time  the year compliance expense and related potential effect of the company s earnings are estimated to be insignificant 
however  the risks associated with the year problem are pervasive and complex  can be difficult to identify and to address  and can result in material adverse consequences to the company 
even if the company  in a timely manner  completes all of its assessments  identifies and tests remediation plans believed to be adequate  and develops contingency plans believed to be adequate  some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted of us government obligations and commercial paper of million  typically with maturities of less than months see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these securities  like all us government obligations and commercial paper  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material 
additionally  the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  the company would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in income or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk the company has international sales and research and development facilities and is  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
the company s foreign currency risks are mitigated principally by maintaining only minimal foreign currency balances 
to date  the exposure to the company related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
if the foreign currency rates fluctuate by from rates at december   the effect on the company s financial position and results of operations would not be material 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future
