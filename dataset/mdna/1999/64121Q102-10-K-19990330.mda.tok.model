overview network solutions currently acts as the exclusive registry and registrar of internet domain names within the 
com  
org  
net and 
edu top level domains pursuant to the cooperative agreement with the department of commerce 
domain names are used to identify a unique site or presence on the internet 
as registry and registrar for these top level domains  network solutions registers new domain names and is responsible for the maintenance of the master file of domain names through daily updates to the internet 
network solutions also provides internet technology services  focusing on network engineering  network and systems security and network management solutions 
cumulative net registrations gross registrations less management s estimate of uncollectible registrations and of non re registrations within the top level domains administered by network solutions increased by  from  domain names registered at december  to  domain names registered at december  net registrations in the

international registrations accounted for of net new registrations during and of net new registrations during net revenue from registration services accounted for of network solutions net revenue for the year ended december  network solutions delivers internet technology services to large companies that desire to establish or enhance their internet presence or re engineer legacy network infrastructures to accommodate the integration of both internet connectivity and internal enterprise network  or intranet  technology into their information technology base 
our internet technology services include network engineering  network and systems security and network management 
during the year ended december   network solutions provided internet technology services to more than companies 
net revenue from internet technology services accounted for of network solutions net revenue for the year ended december  registration services in december  network solutions entered into the cooperative agreement with the national science foundation under which network solutions was to provide internet domain name registration services for five top level domains 
com  
org  
net  
edu and 
gov 
these registration services include the initial two year domain name registration and annual re registration  and throughout the registration term  maintenance of and unlimited modifications to individual domain name records and updates to the master file of domain names 
the cooperative agreement became effective january  it included a three month phase in period  a five year operational period  commencing april  and ending march   and a six month flexibility period through september  effective september   the department of commerce took over the administration of the cooperative agreement from the national science foundation 
in october  the cooperative agreement was amended to extend the flexibility period until september  the original terms of the cooperative agreement provided for a cost reimbursement plus fixed fee contract with an initial fee of 
effective september   the national science foundation and network solutions amended the cooperative agreement to require network solutions to begin charging end users a services fee of per year for each domain name in the 
com  
org and 
net top level domains 
until april   registrants paid a services fee of for two years of domain name services upon each initial registration and an annual re registration fee of per year thereafter 
the national science foundation paid the registration fees for domain names within the 
edu and 
gov top level domains through march  commencing april   network solutions agreed with the national science foundation to provide domain name services within the 
edu and 
gov top level domains free of charge 
as of october   network solutions no longer registers or administers domain names in the 
gov top level domain 
under the terms of the september  amendment to the cooperative agreement  of the registration fees collected by network solutions was required to be set aside for the enhancement of the intellectual infrastructure of the internet set aside funds and  as such  was not recognized as revenue by the company 
network solutions has reflected these set aside funds  along with the appropriate percentage of net accounts receivable  as restricted assets and has recorded an equivalent  related current liability 
network solutions maintained the cash received relating to the set aside funds in a separate interest bearing account 
the set aside funds  plus any interest earned  were disbursed at the direction of the national science foundation 
as of december   the company had cumulatively disbursed all set aside funds collected and associated interest earned for a total of million to the national science foundation at their direction 
the restricted cash at december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
on march   the national science foundation and network solutions amended the cooperative agreement to eliminate the set aside requirement effective april  and to reduce the registration fees by a corresponding amount 
initial registrations on and after april  are charged for two years of registration services and an annual re registration fee of per year thereafter 
this amendment had no effect on the revenue currently recognized on each registration  for initial registrations and for re registrations  since network solutions previously did not recognize revenue on the set aside funds 
accordingly  while the revenue to network solutions on a per registration basis does not change  the amount charged to customers declined 
in order to provide prompt access to new domain names on the internet  network solutions generally invoices customers and permits them to pay their registration fees after their domain names are registered 
network solutions experience has been that  for the period from september through december  approximately of new registrations have ultimately been deactivated for non payment 
network solutions believes that this level of uncollectible receivables is due to  among other factors  the large number of individuals and corporations that have registered multiple domain names with the apparent intention of transferring registration for such names at a profit 
such resellers have a greater tendency than other customers to default on their registration fees 
as a consequence  network solutions has recorded a comparable provision for uncollectible accounts in determining net registration revenue 
this provision averaged in and and in and is considered adequate by network solutions 
registration fees charged to customers for registration services are recognized as revenue evenly over the registration term 
for example  network solutions recognizes on a straight line basis over the two year service period for each initial domain name registration  equivalent to per year 
annual re registrations of domain names are recorded as revenue based upon recognized on a straight line basis over the one year service period 
this subscription based model defers revenue recognition until network solutions provides the registration services  including maintenance of and unlimited modifications to individual domain name records  over the respective registration terms 
at december   network solutions had net deferred revenue of million 
expenses for network solutions increased each quarter during  and as a result of increased business activities  primarily attributable to subscriber growth for network solutions registration services business 
network solutions believes continued investments in its back office infrastructure as well as significant expansion of its sales and marketing and product development activities are critical to the achievement of its goals and anticipates that costs and expenses will continue to increase in each quarter for the foreseeable future 
internet technology services substantially all of network solutions internet technology services revenue is derived from professional services which are generally provided to clients on a time and expense basis and is recognized as services are performed 
the majority of network solutions internet technology services are provided to customers in the financial services industry

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship to net revenue of certain items in network solutions statements of operations 
year ended december  percentage of net revenue net revenue cost of revenue gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses interest and other expense income income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss comparison of years ended december  and net revenue net revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of domain name registrations  principally in the 
com top level domain 
net revenue from registration services increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net new registrations increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  growth in net registrations continues to be driven by the widespread use and adoption by businesses of the internet and intranets on a global basis 
cumulative net registrations as of december  were  as compared to  as of december  for a increase 
additionally  net new registrations increased from  for the three months ended december  to  for the three months ended december  this also represents a increase over the  net new registrations for the three months ended september  the growth in cumulative net registrations was a increase in network solutions entire customer base since september  net revenue from internet technology services increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  further  the fourth quarter reflected an increase of over the same quarter last year and a increase over the third quarter of nationsbanc accounted for million or of network solutions total net revenue for the year ended december  and million or for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the internet technology services division added new leadership in sales and operations and hired additional technical consultants 
in addition  the division continued to emphasize its efforts targeted at lead generation and regional sales and marketing programs by opening offices in new york city and atlanta  georgia 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits  fees paid to subcontractors for work performed in connection with revenue producing projects  depreciation and equipment costs  lease costs of the operations infrastructure and the associated operating overhead 
cost of revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by a million increase in labor  a million increase in outsourcing costs and million in additional depreciation charges and equipment expenditures primarily associated with supporting the growth of network solutions registration services business 
in the near term  the continued investment in the back office infrastructure and provision of customer service is expected to partially offset future margin improvements arising from economies of scale 
as a percentage of net revenue  cost of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  principally reflecting economies of scale and other operational efficiencies achieved in network solutions registration business 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and consultant expenses to support the creation  development and enhancement of network solutions products  services and technologies 
research and development expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  all significant research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
network solutions expects that the level of research and development expenses will continue to increase in the near future in terms of absolute dollars as network solutions invests in developing new service offerings 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of business development  general management  administrative and financial personnel  marketing expenses  corporate services from saic  legal and other professional costs and amortization of goodwill associated with network solutions acquisition by saic 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a million increase in marketing and business development expenses including television  internet banner advertising and targeted direct mail campaigns  increased staffing expenses of million and an increase in legal and other professional costs of million 
as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  network solutions expects that the level of selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase significantly in the near future in terms of absolute dollars as operations continue to expand 
in particular  sales  marketing and business development expenses will increase as network solutions continues to promote the value of a 
com web address and other new internet based value added services 
network solutions also plans to continue to develop its distribution channels  both domestically and internationally 
interest income network solutions had net interest income of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to the investment of the positive cash flow resulting primarily from increasing domain name registrations and the net proceeds of network solutions initial public offering 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was of pretax earnings  or million for the year ended december   and  or million for the year ended december  the difference between the effective rates for both periods presented is principally attributable to the relative impact that non deductible goodwill had on pretax operating income 
goodwill is being amortized by network solutions over five years and is associated with the acquisition of network solutions by saic in comparison of years ended december  and net revenue net revenue increased from million in to million in this increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of domain name registrations  principally in the 
com top level domain 
net revenue from registration services increased from million in to million in net new registrations increased from  during to  during growth in registrations was driven by the widespread use and adoption by businesses of the internet and intranets on a global basis 
cumulative net registrations as of december  were  as compared to  as of december   for a increase 
net revenue from internet technology services decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in business from nationsbanc 
nationsbanc  network solutions largest internet technology services client  accounted for million or of network solutions total net revenue in and million or of network solutions total net revenue in cost of revenue cost of revenue increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily driven by the growth of network solutions registration business which experienced additional labor costs of million and additional outsourcing costs of million in support of network solutions invoicing  collection and processing activities 
in june  network solutions opened a  square foot facility to support its internet business operations and in january  network solutions signed an agreement to lease an additional  square feet at the same location 
as a percentage of net revenue  cost of revenue decreased from in to in this decrease primarily reflects economies of scale that network solutions achieved due to the growth of its subscription based domain name registration business 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from  in to million in all of network solutions research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses were for both and selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily attributable to increased management and administrative labor expenses of million  business development expenses of million and an increase in legal costs of million 
as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in the decrease in percentage of net revenue reflects economies of scale network solutions achieved due primarily to the growth of its domain name registration business 
interest income network solutions had net interest income of  in as compared to million in the increase is attributable to the investment of the net proceeds of network solutions stock offering as well as improved cash flow resulting from the increase in domain name registrations 
income taxes benefit the income tax benefit was  in as compared to an income tax expense of million in the effective tax rate changed from in to in the difference between the effective rates is principally attributable to the relative impact that non deductible goodwill had on pretax operating income or loss for the year 
goodwill is being amortized by network solutions over five years and is associated with the acquisition of network solutions by saic in factors affecting operating results the department of commerce has adopted a plan  referred to as the statement of policy or white paper  calling for a phased transition of the department s responsibilities for the domain name system to a not for profit corporation by september  the domain name system is the system by which internet names and addresses are registered  allocated and used 
we face risks from this transition 
as the us government transitions certain responsibilities for domain name system administration to the not for profit corporation  corresponding obligations under our cooperative agreement with the department of commerce may be terminated and  as appropriate  covered in a contract between the not for profit corporation and us 
we might not reach an acceptable contractual agreement with the not for profit corporation for our continuing role in the registration of domain names 
the us government has sent us a letter directing us to treat icann as the not for profit corporation identified in the october amendment to the cooperative agreement described above  in the performance of its obligations under the mou and until such time as the mou is terminated 
we have not yet responded to that letter 
we are currently in discussions with icann and the us government regarding implementation of the shared registration system and a wide range of contractual issues 
we cannot be sure that these discussions will result in agreements favorable to us 
despite the significant efforts undertaken to date  it is impossible to predict at this time whether or when the process initiated by the statement of policy will result in the full transition to the not for profit corporation of domain name system responsibilities as and to the extent contemplated in the white paper and  if it does  the effect on us of such transition 
see business ongoing privatization of internet administration 
termination  or a change in the terms  of the cooperative agreement could harm our business 
while the cooperative agreement by its terms expires in september  it may be terminated earlier 
the department of commerce s interpretation of certain provisions of the cooperative agreement could differ from ours 
for example  the department of commerce has publicly expressed concerns about our consolidation into a single web site the web sites through which our internic registration services and our registrationplus services were offered 
these differences in interpretation could lead to disputes between us and the department of commerce or the not for profit corporation  which may or may not be resolved in our favor 
certain aspects of implementation of the cooperative agreement also remain to be fully negotiated  including the maximum price we will charge for registry services in the top level domains for which we now act as registry 
if we are unsuccessful in negotiating acceptable terms of implementation  the costs of implementation of the cooperative agreement  our relationship with the not for profit corporation and other matters affecting our position in a more competitive domain name system environment could be harmed 
see business status of cooperative agreement 
withdrawal of or challenges to the us government s sponsorship or authorization of certain functions that we perform could create a public perception or result in a legal finding that we lack authority to continue in our current role as registry or registrar within the 
com  
org  
net and 
edu top level domains 
the legal authority underlying the roles of the department of commerce and the not for profit corporation with regard to the domain name system also could be challenged 
the impact  if any  of any such public perception or finding is unknown  but it could be harmful to our business 
the introduction of additional competition into the domain name registration business could be harmful to our business 
this includes  in particular  competition among registrars within a single top level domain  like 
com  and competition among registrars and registries of existing and potential new top level domains 
in addition  we currently face competition in the domain name registration business from registries for country code top level domains  third level domain name providers such as internet access providers and registrars and registries of top level domains other than those top level domains which we currently register 
a number of entities have already begun to offer competing registration services using other top level domains and when the shared registration system takes effect we will no longer be the exclusive registrar in the 
com  
org and 
net top level domains 
our revenue could be reduced due to increased competition  pricing pressures or a modification of billing practices 
for example  other entities may bundle domain name registrations with other products or services 
see business competition in the registration business 
our future success substantially depends on the continued growth in the use of the internet 
if the use of and interest in the internet does not continue to grow  our business would be harmed 
any significant problem with our systems or operations could result in lost revenue  customer dissatisfaction or lawsuits against us 
a failure in the operation of our registration system could result in deletion of one or more domain names from the internet for a period of time 
a failure in the operation or update of the master database that we maintain could result in deletion of one or more top level domains from the internet and the discontinuation of second level domain names in those top level domains for a period of time 
the inability of our registration system and telecommunications systems to meet the demands of the increasing number of domain name registration requests and corresponding customer e mails and telephone calls could result in substantial degradation in our customer support service and our ability to process registration requests in a timely manner 
our operations depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption 
the root zone servers and top level domain zone servers that we operate are critical hardware to our operations 
our failure  or the failure of third parties on which we rely  to adequately address year compliance issues may cause us to lose revenue or to incur significant costs 
the primary risks that we face with regard to year failures are those which impact our domain name registration business 
if we fail to solve a year compliance problem with our mission critical business systems and processes  including the domain name servers under our control  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by our employees  the result could be a failure of or interruption to normal business operations 
on november   we announced the resignation of gabriel a 
battista from his positions as chief executive officer and director 
we cannot reasonably estimate at this time the potential impact on us of the hiring of a new chief executive officer 
we cannot be certain of the timing of our hiring of a new chief executive officer or the effect of any delays in our hiring of a new chief executive officer on the development or implementation of our strategic plan 
given the relative newness and rapid growth of the internet  there is intense competition for the limited supply of people qualified to work for us 
our future success depends on the continued service of key engineering  sales  marketing  executive and administrative personnel  and our ability to attract  hire  integrate  train and retain such personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or our failure to attract  integrate  train and retain additional key employees could harm our business 
we may not be able to sustain the revenue growth we have experienced in recent periods 
in addition  past revenue growth may not be indicative of future operating results 
if we do not successfully maintain our current position as a leading provider of domain name registration services or develop or market additional services  our business could be harmed 
our domain name registration services business generates over of our revenue and is expected to continue to account for a very significant portion of our revenue in at least the near term 
our ability to achieve future revenue growth will also depend on our ability to continue to establish direct sales channels and to develop multiple distribution channels 
to do this we must maintain relationships with internet access providers and other third parties 
because of our high level of uncollectible receivables  we continually review our billing practices 
any modifications that we implement as a result of these reviews could have unanticipated harmful consequences to our business 
we have established a provision for uncollectible accounts which we believe to be adequate to cover anticipated uncollectible receivables  however  actual results could differ from our estimates 
we are involved in several legal proceedings 
we cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact of any of these proceedings 
an adverse determination in any of these proceedings  however  could harm our business 
legal proceedings in which we are involved are expensive and divert our personnel 
see item legal proceedings 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in addition  we expect a significant increase in our operating expenses 
if the increase in our expenses is not followed by an increase in our revenue  our operating results will be harmed 
the fact that in the past our revenues have increased and we have been profitable on a quarterly and annual basis is not indicative of whether our revenues will increase or whether we will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in the future

 as a percentage of net revenue net revenue cost of revenue gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses interest income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income network solutions has experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue 
these fluctuations may be caused by  among other things  increases in legal and marketing expenses  market acceptance of new products  competitive pricing pressures and general economic conditions 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  network solutions believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indications of future performance 
see factors affecting operating results and item business risk factors our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  our future revenue and profitability are uncertain 
network solutions net revenue increased each quarter presented primarily due to an increase in the number of cumulative net registrations in each of those quarters 
network solutions currently expects registration services revenue for the first quarter of to show continued growth based upon its existing registration base and net new registrations during the quarter 
however  there can be no assurance that net registration revenue will continue to increase at historical rates  or at all  or not decrease in the future  especially when the cooperative agreement is terminated or if there is a change in network solutions status as the exclusive registry and registrar for domain names in the 
com  
net and 
org top level domains  particularly as a significant portion of network solutions net revenue is attributable to registrations in the 
com top level domains 
notwithstanding the million of deferred revenue at december   of which million will be recognized as revenue in  network solutions revenue is dependent in large part on the continued growth of the internet  network solutions ability to maintain its position as the leading internet domain name registration service provider worldwide and the evolving nature of network solutions services  products and other factors 
operating expenses have generally increased in absolute dollars in each quarter shown as network solutions has increased staffing and related infrastructure costs in its back office  selling and marketing  and administrative functions 
quarter to quarter growth in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to increased staffing levels and increased outsourcing costs which are a function of the number of registrants 
quarter to quarter growth in selling  general and administrative expenses are attributable to increased staffing at the management level  continuing legal expenses and marketing costs associated with the introduction of new services and products 
liquidity and capital resources from the time of its acquisition by saic in march until december  network solutions participated in saic s centralized cash management system whereby cash received from operations was transferred to saic s centralized cash accounts and cash disbursements were funded from such centralized cash accounts 
accordingly  cash requirements for operating purposes and for capital expenditures were met from this source 
beginning in  network solutions implemented its own cash management system 
at december   network solutions principal source of liquidity was its cash and cash equivalents of million and its short term investments of million  which when combined represent an increase of million from the december  balance in those accounts 
network solutions also has million of marketable securities held as long term investments as of december at december   network solutions cumulative net obligation to saic for intercompany activity was million  a net increase of million from december  intercompany activity is primarily comprised of salaries and benefits paid by saic on behalf of network solutions 
network solutions currently reimburses saic for intercompany activity on a monthly basis 
pursuant to a tax sharing agreement with saic dated september   network solutions now generally remits income tax payments directly to tax authorities as it no longer is part of saic s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  this amount is principally attributed to net income plus the increase in deferred revenue reflecting cash collected in advance of registration services revenue recognition which occurs ratably over the two and one year registration terms 
partially offsetting this amount is an increase in deferred tax assets resulting from accelerated revenue recognition for tax purposes and the associated tax liabilities 
investing activities totaled million for the year ended december   of which million was net purchases of short term investments and million of long term investments 
these investments are primarily comprised of commercial investment grade securities 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
these expenditures were primarily for computer equipment 
network solutions will continue to invest in the back office infrastructure in advance of continued growth in domain name registrations and as network solutions designs and builds the shared registration system in accordance with the cooperative agreement 
network solutions believes that its existing cash balance  investments and cash flows expected from future operations will be sufficient to meet network solutions capital requirements for at least the next months 
year compliance network solutions is continually assessing the potential effects of the year millennium change on network solutions business systems and processes  including the internet domain name servers under network solutions control  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by its employees and its outsourcing vendors 
network solutions year project is proceeding on schedule 
the project goal is to ensure that network solutions business is not impacted by the date transitions associated with the year network solutions year project plan is coordinated by a team that reports directly to senior management 
the project team is evaluating the year compliance of network solutions business systems and processes  including the internet domain name servers under network solutions control  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by its employees and its outsourcing vendors whom provide services relating to network solutions domain name registration business 
network solutions year project is comprised of the following parallel phases phase inventory all of network solutions business systems and processes  including the internet domain name servers under network solutions control  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by its employees in order to assign priorities to potentially impacted systems and services 
this phase has been completed  phase assess the year compliance of all inventoried business systems and processes  including the internet domain name servers under network solutions control  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by its employees and determine whether to renovate or replace any non year compliant systems and services 
the assessment of mission critical systems has been completed however  assessment continues as a life cycle development activity  phase complete remediation of any non year compliant business systems and processes  including the internet domain name servers under network solutions control  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by its employees 
conduct procurements to replace any other non year compliant business systems and processes  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by its employees that won t be remediated 
all remediation efforts are expected to be completed by june   phase test and validate remediated and replacement systems  if any such remediation or replacement is required  to ensure inter system compliance and mission critical system functionality 
the testing and validation efforts  if any are required  are expected to be completed by august   phase deploy and implement remediated and replacement systems after the completion of successful testing and validation 
the deployment and implementation of the remediated or replacement systems are expected to be completed by october   and phase design contingency and business continuation plans in the event of the failure of business systems and processes  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by network solutions employees due to the year millennium change 
the initial contingency and business continuation plan has been developed 
the final contingency plan will be completed during the second quarter of and it will be updated throughout the year as appropriate 
based on its inventory and assessment  network solutions has found that less than one half of one percent of the software code of its mission critical systems needs to be remediated to be made year compliant 
however  network solutions  in its normal course of business  anticipates replacing or upgrading  prior to the millennium change  portions of these systems with new systems which will also be year compliant 
currently  network solutions is enhancing its back office and registration related systems and the software relating to its core domain name registration services business 
when complete in  this enhancement effort will result in replacing portions of the existing registration related systems which will be procured from vendors as year compliant and will be subjected to both component and end to end testing and validation to determine the year compliance of such systems prior to acceptance and deployment in network solutions business 
this enhancement effort is a function of network solutions business growth and not a year remediation effort 
based on its inventory and assessment  network solutions has found no material year problems with its facilities and telecommunications systems 
network solutions has conducted detailed assessments of the components of its telecommunications infrastructure and is working to identify appropriate system testing guidelines 
in addition  network solutions is seeking assurances from its facilities landlords and telecommunications equipment vendors and data circuit providers regarding the year compliance of their facilities and equipment 
in the event of electrical power interruption outside of network solutions control  network solutions has deployed back up power systems capable of operating its core business indefinitely 
network solutions is now in the remediation and testing phases of its project cycle 
at this time  network solutions believes that its incremental remediation costs needed to make its current business systems and processes  including the internet domain name servers under network solutions control  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by its employees year compliant are not material 
while network solutions is incurring some incremental costs directly relating to staff augmentation for the year program management and technical assessment  the costs expended by network solutions through december  are less than  network solutions expected total costs  including remediation and replacement costs  are estimated to be between  and  over the life of the year project 
since portions of the mission critical back office and domain name registration related systems will generally be replaced as a function of business growth  the labor and capital costs associated with such replacement systems are not directly attributed to achieving year compliance 
network solutions will also incur costs for extending its software testing architecture which  in addition to testing remediated systems  will be used as a normal component of network solutions quality assurance infrastructure 
as such these costs are not directly categorized as year project costs but as normal business development and engineering costs 
network solutions is contacting its hardware and software vendors  significant suppliers  outsourcing service providers and contracting parties to determine the extent to which network solutions is vulnerable to any such third party s failure to achieve year compliance for their own systems 
at the present time  network solutions does not expect year issues of any such third parties to materially affect network solutions business 
furthermore  network solutions business depends on the continued operation of  and widespread access to  the internet 
this  in turn  depends to a large extent on the software and systems of third parties on which network solutions systems rely or to which they are connected 
these third parties include  among others  internet related companies  including internet web hosting companies  internet access providers and internet domain name server operators 
network solutions can give no assurances that the software or systems of such third parties will be year compliant or that the failure of such third parties to achieve year compliance will not have a material adverse effect on network solutions 
to the extent that the normal operation of the internet is disrupted by the year millennium change  network solutions business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
should network solutions fail to solve a year compliance problem to its mission critical business systems and processes  including the internet domain name servers under network solutions control  telecommunications systems  facilities  data networking infrastructure  commercial off the shelf hardware  software and components used by its employees  the result could be a failure or interruption to normal business operations 
network solutions believes that  with the deployment of the new back office and domain name registration related systems in  the potential for significant interruptions to normal operations should be minimized 
network solutions primary risks with regard to year failures are those which impact its domain name registration business 
the reasonably likely worst case risks inherent in network solutions business are as follows significant and protracted interruption of electrical power to data and call center operations in network solutions engineering facility could materially and negatively impact network solutions ability to provide data and call center operations 
to mitigate this risk  network solutions has deployed back up power systems capable of operating indefinitely 
however  electrical power interruptions that impact internet connectivity providers could adversely impact network solutions because of network solutions reliance upon internet based operations for its day to day business 
significant and protracted interruption of telecommunications and data network services in either of network solutions headquarters or engineering facilities could materially and negatively impact network solutions ability to provide data and call center operations 
network solutions has conducted detailed assessments of the components of its telecommunications infrastructure and is working to identify appropriate system testing guidelines 
as part of its technical assessment  network solutions identified the compliance status of its data networking infrastructure and developed plans for remediation 
finally  network solutions has plans to seek additional assurances and a better understanding of the compliance programs of its telecommunications and data circuit providers 
the failure of components of network solutions current back office and domain name registration related systems could materially and negatively impact network solutions business 
however  as a function of business growth  these systems are planned to be retired before the end of as a contingency planning measure  network solutions has conducted a technical assessment of the current systems and their software applications in the event that the deployment of the new systems is delayed beyond december despite the assurances of network solutions third party suppliers  hardware and software vendors  and outsourcing service providers regarding the year compliance of their products and services  the potential exists that a year problem relating to such third party suppliers  vendors and outsourcing service providers products and services could have a material impact on network solutions business 
network solutions is conducting monthly discussions with its mission critical outsourcing service providers to determine the progress of their year compliance programs 
although network solutions has found that it only has to remediate a small portion of its software code in its internal mission critical systems and despite network solutions expectation that its enhancement effort will result in year compliant back office and registration related systems and software relating to its core domain name registration services business  network solutions is currently developing a business continuation contingency plan and is performing a test on the existing core registration related systems that are being replaced 
network solutions finalized its initial contingency plan and completed testing of all existing systems 
the final business continuation plan will be completed during the second quarter of and will be updated as appropriate throughout the year 
although network solutions is taking appropriate steps so that network solutions business is not impacted by the date transitions associated with the year  network solutions has no responsibility for  nor control over other internet domain name server operators or tens of thousands of lower level domain name system server operators that are critical to the efficient operation of the internet 
network solutions has not determined whether such domain name server operators or other server operators have hardware  software or firmware that is year compliant
