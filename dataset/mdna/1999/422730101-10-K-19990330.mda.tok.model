results of operations general the company s telephone revenues are principally derived from the local service and access revenues received by its local exchange carrier lec subsidiaries 
local service revenues are earned by providing customers with local service to connecting points within the local exchange boundaries and  in certain cases  to nearby local exchanges under extended area service eas plans that eliminate long distance charges to the neighboring exchanges 
monthly rates for telephone service differ among the lecs depending upon the cost of providing service  the type and grade of service  the number of customers and calling patterns within the toll free calling area and other factors 
access revenues are received by lecs for intrastate and interstate exchange services provided to long distance carriers generally referred to as interexchange carriers or ixcs which enable ixcs to provide long distance service to end users in the local exchange network 
access revenues are determined  in the case of interstate calls  according to rules promulgated by the federal communications commission fcc and administered by the national exchange carriers association neca and  in the case of intrastate calls  by state regulatory agencies 
a relatively small portion of the company s access revenues are derived from subscriber line fees determined by the fcc and billed directly to end users for access to long distance carriers 
the balance of the company s interstate access revenues are received from neca  which collects payments from ixcs and distributes settlement payments to lecs based on a number of factors  including the cost of providing service and the amount of time the local network is utilized to provide long distance services 
a variety of factors  including increased subscriber counts  cultural and technological changes  and rate reductions by ixcs  have resulted in a consistent pattern of increasing use of the nation s telephone network since this growth has produced higher revenues for neca and increased settlements for its participating lecs 
the company s settlements from neca have increased every year since the pool was established in lecs also sell and lease customer premise telephone equipment  provide inside wiring services and custom calling features  provide internet access and sell and lease other facilities for private line  teletype  data transmission and other communications services 
lecs also provide billing and collection services for certain ixcs in lieu of such ixcs directly billing customers within the lecs service area 
the company s cable television revenues are derived almost exclusively from monthly fees for basic and premium services

effects of inflation the company s local exchange telephone companies are subject to the jurisdiction of minnesota  iowa  south dakota and wisconsin regulatory authorities with respect to a variety of matters  including rates for intrastate access services  the conditions and quality of service  issuance of debt  depreciation rates and accounting methods 
rates for local telephone service are not established directly by regulatory authorities  but their authority over other matters limits the company s ability to implement rate increases 
in addition  the regulatory process inherently restricts the company s ability to immediately pass cost increases along to customers unless the cost increases are anticipated and the rate increases implemented prospectively 
year issues the software used by the company s data processing and central office equipment was originally designed to use references to calendar dates on an abbreviated basis 
under this system  references to the calendar year are abbreviated to the last two digits of the year  ie is abbreviated as 
most software using this system does not recognize that the year  abbreviated as  follows this causes computing errors in date sensitive processes 
the company has surveyed its central office and data processing systems to locate computer systems that may be subject to this error 
the company has determined that the central office switching equipment used in its local telephone exchanges to connect customer calls and record telephone usage is not year compliant 
if not corrected  this could interrupt telephone services for customers  interrupt connections between the company s telephone system and the national and worldwide telephone networks  and make the company unable to accurately bill customers for telephone usage 
the company s system may also be vulnerable to year problems in other telephone networks with which it interconnects 
the company cannot estimate what its liability to customers and regulators from such a loss of service might be 
the company relies on switching equipment and software provided by nortel  inc and does not itself have the technical expertise required to make all the necessary hardware and software corrections required to bring its system into year compliance 
it has contracted with nortel  inc to upgrade its equipment to year compliance 
it is the company s understanding that nortel  inc has completed testing of the new software and hardware and that no additional action related to this problem will be required when installation is complete 
estimated cost is  the company began upgrading its central office equipment and related software to year compliance in the third quarter of installation and testing of all the new hardware and software interconnections is expected to be completed in november the company s billing  accounting and management information systems utilize software provided by martin and associates 
the company believes this software to be year compliant 
at the present time  the company does not expect year problems to cause any interruption of service to customers or cause material disruptions to its own operations 
the company is in constant contact with its equipment supplier and with management and service personnel of other telephone service providers and affected customers as the upgrade and integration process moves forward 
the company also plans to have additional personnel available as required to address any new year problems that arise 
the company does not expect year problems to cause any loss of service to customers  but will continue to monitor the situation and modify its business plans and procedures as the situation warrants
