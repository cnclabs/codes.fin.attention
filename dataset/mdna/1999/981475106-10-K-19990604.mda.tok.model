an event of default  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of the indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 
market risks 
the company s oil recycling segment was adversely affected by the significant decline in oil prices during fiscal lower fuel prices coupled with the company s fixed operating costs in its oil recycling operations resulted in a decline in income from operations in this segment during fiscal  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing elsewhere in this report 
the company is a provider of aviation fuel services primarily to the secondary passenger and cargo airlines  and a provider of marine fuel services to the cargo container shipping lines 
the company s fuel services are provided through relationships with the large independent oil suppliers  as well as the government owned oil companies 
the company could be adversely affected by industry consolidation  on the customer side  because of increased merger activity in the airline and shipping industries and  on the supply side  because of increased competition from the larger oil companies who could choose to directly market to smaller airlines and shipping companies or by providing less advantageous credit and price terms 
pollution and third party liability 
the company  through the use of subcontractors and its own operations  transports  stores or processes flammable aviation  marine and residual fuel subjecting it to possible claims by employees  customers  regulators and others who may be injured by a spill or other accident 
in addition  the company may be held liable for the clean up costs of spills or releases of materials from its facilities or vehicles  or for damages to natural resources arising out of such events 
the company follows what it believes to be prudent procedures to protect its employees and customers and to prevent spills or releases of these materials 
the company s domestic and international fueling activities also subject it to the risks of significant potential liability under federal  foreign and state statutes  common law and indemnification agreements 
the company has general and automobile liability insurance coverage  including the statutory motor carrier act mcs endorsement for sudden and accidental pollution 
in the aviation and marine fuel segments  the company utilizes subcontractors which provide various services to customers  including into plane fueling at airports  fueling of vessels in port and at sea  and transportation and storage of fuel and fuel products 
although the company generally requires its subcontractors to carry liability insurance  not all subcontractors carry adequate insurance 
the company s liability insurance policy does not cover the acts or omissions of its subcontractors 
if the company is held responsible for any liability caused by its subcontractors  and such liability is not page adequately covered by the subcontractor s insurance and is of sufficient magnitude  the company s financial position and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the company has exited several environmental businesses which handled hazardous waste 
this waste was transported to various disposal facilities and or treated by the company 
the company may be held liable as a potentially responsible party for the clean up of such disposal facilities in certain cases pursuant to current federal and state laws and regulations 
the company continuously reviews the adequacy of its insurance coverage 
however  the company lacks coverage for various risks 
a claim arising out of the company s activities  if successful and of sufficient magnitude  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
regulation the company s operations are subject to substantial regulation by federal  foreign  state and local government agencies  which enforce laws and regulations which restrict the transportation  storage and disposal of hazardous waste and the collection  transportation  processing  storage  use and disposal of waste oil 
the principal laws and regulations affecting the business of the company and the markets it serves are as follows the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of superfund or cercla establishes a program for federally directed response or remedial actions with respect to the uncontrolled discharge of hazardous substances  pollutants or contaminants  including waste oil  into the environment 
the law authorizes the federal government either to seek a binding order directing responsible parties to undertake such actions or authorizes the federal government to undertake such actions and then to seek compensation for the cost of clean up and other damages from potentially responsible parties 
congress established a federally managed trust fund  commonly known as the superfund  to fund response and remedial actions undertaken by the federal government 
the trust fund is used to fund federally conducted actions when no financially able or willing responsible party has been found 
the superfund amendments and re authorization act of sara adopted more detailed and stringent standards for remedial action at superfund sites  and clarified provisions requiring damage assessments to determine the extent and monetary value of injury to natural resources 
sara also provides a separate funding mechanism for the clean up of underground storage tanks 
the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra established a comprehensive regulatory framework for the management of hazardous waste at active facilities 
rcra sets up a cradle to grave system for the management of hazardous waste  imposing upon all parties who generate  transport  treat  store or dispose of waste  above certain minimum quantities  requirements for performance  testing and record keeping 
rcra also requires permits for construction  operation and closure of facilities and requires years of post closure care and monitoring 
rcra was amended in to increase the scope of rcra regulation of small quantity waste generators and waste oil handlers and recyclers  require corrective action at hazardous waste facilities including remediation at page certain previously closed solid waste management units  phase in restrictions on disposal of hazardous waste  and require the identification and regulation of underground storage tanks containing petroleum and certain chemicals 
on november   the environmental protection agency epa issued final regulations under rcra which restrict the burning of waste oil 
these regulations prohibit burning waste oil in non industrial boilers unless the oil meets certain standards of lead  arsenic  chromium  chlorine  cadmium  and flashpoint levels 
the regulations do not restrict the burning of waste oil in industrial boilers and furnaces 
these regulations have not had a significant impact on the company s business because the company does not presently sell recycled fuel to non industrial burners 
industrial burners of recycled oil  however  must comply with certain notification and administrative procedures 
the clean air act of  as amended in  was the first major federal environmental law to establish national ambient air quality standards for certain air pollutants  which are to be achieved by the individual states through state implementation plans sips 
sips typically attempt to meet ambient standards by regulating the quantity and quality of emissions from specific industrial sources 
for toxic emissions  the act authorizes the epa to regulate emissions from industrial facilities directly 
the epa also directly establishes emissions limits for new sources of pollution  and is responsible for ensuring compliance with air quality standards 
the clean air act amendments of place the primary responsibility for the prevention and control of air pollution upon state and local governments 
the amendments require regulated emission sources to obtain operating permits  which could impose emission limitations  standards  and compliance schedules 
the clean water act of  as amended in  establishes water pollutant discharge standards applicable to many basic types of manufacturing plants and imposes standards on municipal sewage treatment plants 
the act requires states to set water quality standards for significant bodies of water within their boundaries and to ensure attainment and or maintenance of those standards 
most industrial and government facilities must apply for and obtain discharge permits  monitor pollutant discharges  and under certain conditions reduce certain discharges 
the safe drinking water act  as amended in  regulates public water supplies by requiring the epa to establish primary drinking water standards 
these standards are likely to be further expanded under the epa s evolving groundwater protection strategy which is intended to set levels of protection or clean up of the nation s groundwater resources 
these groundwater quality requirements will then be applied to rcra facilities and cercla sites  and remedial action will be required for releases of contaminants into groundwater 
the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol places strict limitations on the discharge of oil at sea and in port and requires ships to transfer oily waste to certified reception facilities 
the us coast guard has issued regulations effective march  which implement the requirements of marpol 
under these regulations  each terminal and port of the united states that services oceangoing tankers or cargo ships over gross tons must be capable of receiving an average amount of oily waste based on the type and number of ships it serves 
the reception facilities may be fixed or mobile  and may include tank trucks and tank barges 
the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  a program promulgated under the clean water act  permits states to issue permits for the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the page united states in lieu of federal epa regulation 
state programs must be consistent with minimum federal requirements  although they may be more stringent 
npdes permits are required for  among other things  certain industrial discharges of storm water 
the oil pollution act of imposes liability for oil discharges  or threats of discharge  into the navigable waters of the united states on the owner or operator of the responsible vessel or facility 
oil is defined to include oil refuse and oil mixed with wastes other than dredged spoil  but does not include oil designated as a hazardous substance under cercla 
the act requires the responsible party to pay all removal costs  including the costs to prevent  minimize or mitigate oil pollution in any case in which there is a discharge or a substantial threat of an actual discharge of oil 
in addition  the responsible party may be held liable for damages for injury to natural resources  loss of use of natural resources and loss of revenues from the use of such resources 
state and local government regulations 
many states have been authorized by the epa to enforce regulations promulgated under rcra and other federal programs 
in addition  there are numerous state and local authorities that regulate the environment  some of which impose stricter environmental standards than federal laws and regulations 
some states  including florida  have enacted legislation which generally provides for registration  recordkeeping  permitting  inspection  and reporting requirements for transporters  collectors and recyclers of hazardous waste and waste oil 
the penalties for violations of state law include injunctive relief  recovery of damages for injury to air  water or property and fines for non compliance 
in addition  some local governments have established local pollution control programs  which include environmental permitting  monitoring and surveillance  data collection and local environmental studies 
foreign government regulations 
many foreign governments impose laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and the discharge of pollutants in the environment 
such laws and regulations could impose significant liability on the company for damages  clean up costs and penalties for discharges of pollutants in the environment  as well as injunctive relief 
in addition  some foreign government agencies have established pollution control programs  which include environmental permitting  monitoring and surveillance  data collection and environmental impact assessments 
excise tax on diesel fuel 
the company s aviation and marine fueling operations are affected by various federal and state taxes imposed on the purchase and sale of aviation and marine fuel products in the united states 
federal law imposes a manufacturer s excise tax on sales of aviation and marine fuel 
sales to aircraft and vessels engaged in foreign trade are exempt from this tax 
these exemptions may be realized either through tax free or tax reduced sales  if the seller qualifies as a producer under applicable regulations  or  if the seller does not so qualify  through a tax paid sale followed by a refund to the exempt user 
several states  where the company sells aviation and marine fuel  impose excise and sales taxes on fuel sales  certain sales of the company qualify for full or partial exemptions from these state taxes

page liquidity and capital resources in the company s aviation and marine fuel businesses  the primary use of capital is to finance receivables 
the company maintains aviation fuel inventories at certain locations in the united states for competitive reasons  but inventory levels are kept at an operating minimum 
the company also maintains inventory in its offshore fueling operations 
the company s aviation and marine fuel businesses historically have not required significant capital investment in fixed assets as the company subcontracts fueling services and maintains inventory at third party storage facilities 
in contrast to the company s aviation and marine fueling segments  the oil recycling segment s capital requirements are for the financing of property  plant and equipment  and accounts receivable 
the company generally utilizes internally generated cash to fund capital expenditures  and secondarily the company will utilize its available line of credit or enter into leasing or installment note arrangements to match fund the useful life of certain long term assets 
the company s oil recycling operations also require working capital to purchase and carry an inventory of used oil  as well as the costs of operating the plant until the proceeds from the re refined oil sales are received

euro currency on january   eleven of fifteen members of the european union launched a common legal currency called the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for business transactions 
the conversion to the euro will eliminate currency exchange risk between the member countries 
beginning january   the participating countries will issue new euro denominated bills and coins for use in cash transactions  and the legal currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the company s functional currency for business throughout europe is the us dollar 
fuel suppliers invoice the company in us dollars and the company invoices its customers in us dollars 
the company is currently implementing a new financial accounting system  which is euro ready and should address the preparation of accounting and tax reports for filing with the uk authorities 
however  as a result of competitive pressures or regulatory requirements  there can be no assurance that in the coming years the euro will not replace the us dollar as the company s functional currency in europe 
if the euro were to replace the us dollar  the company will be required to address currency risk and strategies concerning continuity of existing arrangements with customers and suppliers 
based on its experience to date  the company does not believe that the implementation of the euro will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial position 
year readiness disclosure general 
because computers frequently use only two digits to recognize years  on january   many computer systems  as well as equipment that uses embedded computer chips  may be unable to distinguish between and if not remediated  this problem could create systems errors and failures resulting in the disruption of normal business operations 
since year is a leap year  there could also be business disruptions as a result of the inability of many computer systems to recognize february  page in the first quarter of  the company s information technology group began to address these issues  as they pertain to the internal information and telecommunications systems 
this group continues to work on solving problems related to the year  which include identification and analysis  and correction and testing of computer systems throughout the company 
this group has also taken inventory of equipment that uses embedded computer chips ie  non information technology systems and have scheduled remediation or replacement of this equipment  as necessary 
state of readiness 
the company s year efforts are generally divided into phases for identification  remediation  and testing 
in the identification phase  the company identifies systems that have year issues and determines the steps necessary to remediate these issues 
in the remediation phase  the company replaces  modifies or retires systems  as necessary 
during the testing phase  the company performs testing to determine whether the remediated systems accurately process and identify dates 
as of march   the company had identified all network software  end user computing programs and telephone systems at all of the company s office locations 
the main year non compliant systems and equipment identified were the company s centralized financial systems and the vast majority of personal computers 
during the remediation phase  the company committed  and is in the process of completing the implementation of a new financial system  which is year compliant 
in addition  the company is making the necessary investment to replace existing year non compliant hardware 
year compliant certificates were requested of vendors for products purchased by the company 
to the extent that vendors either fail to provide the required compliancy certificate  or have not made their products or systems year ready  the product is replaced to meet year requirements 
the company believes that approximately of the vendor programs are year compliant as of march  the company has implemented the financial accounting system in two of its three segments

risks 
although the company s remediation efforts are directed at reducing its year exposure  there can be no assurance that these efforts will fully mitigate the effect of year issues and it is likely that one or more events may disrupt the company s normal business operations 
in the event that the company fails to identify or correct a material year problem  there could be disruptions in normal business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that significant foreign or domestic vendors  customers and other third parties will adequately address their year issues 
further  there may be some parties  such as governmental agencies  utilities  telecommunication companies  financial services vendors  third parties contracted by the company to deliver fuel to its customers  and other providers  where alternative arrangements or resources may not be available 
also  risks associated with some foreign third parties may be greater since there is a general concern that some entities operating outside the united states are not addressing the year issues on a timely basis 
the company is also subject to additional credit and performance risks to the extent that customers and suppliers  respectively  fail to adequately address year issues 
although it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of these risks at this time  there may be increases in account receivable write offs  as well as the risk of litigation and potential losses from litigation related to the foregoing

quantitative and qualitative information about market risk the company conducts the vast majority of its business transactions in us dollars 
however  in certain markets  mainly in ecuador through its aviation joint venture and in mexico for payments to its aviation fuel supplier  the company conducts its business in local currency 
this subjects the company to foreign currency exchange risk  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize the risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations through its regular operating and financing activities 
page the company s borrowings pursuant to its revolving credit facility provides for various market driven variable interest rate options 
these interest rates are subject to interest rate changes in the united states and the eurodollar market 
the company does not currently use  nor has it historically used  derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce market risk 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for additional information 
recognizing favorable market conditions or for competitive reasons  the company may enter into short term fuel purchase commitments for the physical delivery of product in the united states 
the company simultaneously may hedge the physical delivery through a commodity based derivative instrument  to minimize the effects of commodity price fluctuations 
as of march   the company did not have any outstanding purchase commitments 
the company offers its customers swaps and caps as part of its fuel management services 
typically  the company simultaneously enters into the commodity based derivative instruments with its customer and a counterparty 
the counterparties are major oil companies and derivative trading firms 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate non performance by such conterparties 
pursuant to these transactions  the company is not affected by market price fluctuations since the contracts have the same terms and conditions except for the fee or spread earned by the company 
performance risk under these contracts is considered a credit risk 
this risk is minimized by dealing with customers meeting additional credit criteria 
as of march   the company had outstanding swap contracts for  metric tons expiring by december  and  in deferred cap fees 
gains on these contracts are recognized at the completion of each transaction 
the company s policy is to not use financial instruments for speculative purposes
