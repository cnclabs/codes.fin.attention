disposable urology products increased from the prior year 
growth continues to be strong in intermittent self catheters 
approximately half of the increase in disposable urology product sales resulted from the mid year acquisition of sierra laboratories  a privately held manufacturer of specialty urological disposables 
sales of surgical urology products were up 
adding to urology product sales were two new products iogold brachytherapy seeds for the treatment of prostate cancer  which was introduced in january  and the suspend sling for treating female urinary incontinence  introduced in may these products accounted for an additional million of sales for the year 
sales of penile implants declined from fiscal  due to competition from a new impotence drug  viagra  which was introduced by pfizer during the company s first quarter of fiscal the viagra introduction and concurrent advertising campaign generated an unprecedented amount of interest in impotence causes and treatments 
the company continues to believe that this interest in treating impotence bodes well for the long term prospects of penile implant sales  as viagra will not work on all patients 
sales of penile implants in the second half of fiscal increased over the first half of the year 
while the company hopes this upward trend will continue  we may continue to see weakness in sales in the near term 
plastic general surgery product sales increased compared to fiscal general surgery products  which include the company s contour genesis soft tissue aspiration system and a line of related disposable products  were up million in fiscal the remaining sales growth in fiscal came from higher sales of plastic surgery products  which had been adversely affected by a fire at the texas manufacturing facility during fiscal sales for fiscal increased from million in to million  an increase of

approximately of the change related to the effect in the sales mix of increased sales of non company manufactured products  such as the iogold brachytherapy seed and the suspend sling 
pursuant to the company s agreements with its manufacturing partners  the company generates approximately a gross margin on these types of products 
the remaining increase in fiscal was primarily related to costs incurred in re validating its manufacturing processes at its texas facility 
in  the food and drug administration fda issued the texas facility a warning letter  citing several inadequacies in the company s adherence to fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda was specifically concerned with the method by which the company had performed its initial validation of the manufacturing processes in the texas facility 
the company agreed to re validate the facility  as well as correct the other items in the warning letter 
the company has committed a variety of resources to the re validation and gmp compliance effort  including the hiring of additional staff  use of outside consultants and extensive testing  both destructive and otherwise  of work in process and finished goods 
in may  the company entered into a voluntary consent decree with the fda  which  among other things  required the company to complete the re validations in the timeframe set forth in the decree 
the consent decree required the company to hire outside expert consultants to assist in strengthening the company s compliance program and related processes 
in july the consultant conducted a comprehensive gmp audit of the texas facility and submitted a detailed written report to mentor management and the fda on its findings 
in that report  the consultant stated that  except for the outstanding re validations  there were no significant areas of gmp non compliance 
the company and fda agreed to time frames under which the company was to complete its re validations of its manufacturing processes  specifically by november  for saline filled devices and by december  for gel filled devices 
the company completed its validations of both devices in those timeframes 
the outside expert consultant reviewed the validations and reported to management and to the fda that all validation projects had been completed in accordance with established milestones and within the timeframes established by the consent decree 
additionally  under the terms of the consent decree  an expert consultant is required to conduct an inspection and to issue a report annually

the increase was primarily related to the fire at the company s texas manufacturing facility 
several production areas were affected by the fire and many of the production departments were shut down for the month of september  and  depending on the department  in october and november 
the higher level of cost of sales for the year was caused by unabsorbed overhead due to a lack of production  combined with inefficiencies upon production startup

higher sales were offset by the restructuring charge and the re validation costs at the texas facility 
inflation the company does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the company s operations over the three year period ended march  liquidity and capital resources during the three years ended march   liquidity needs have been satisfied principally by cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s line of credit

an annual commitment fee of

during fiscal  the company borrowed million under the agreement 
at march   the balance outstanding was million 
this amount was paid off during the first quarter of fiscal the company s board of directors has authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program 
the objectives of the program  among other items  are to offset the issuance of stock options  provide liquidity to the market and to reduce the overall number of shares outstanding 
repurchases are subject to market conditions and cash availability 
in july  the board increased the repurchase authorization by million shares  to a total of million  and instructed the company to increase its share repurchases 
as a result  during fiscal  the company repurchased million shares for consideration of million 
the company s principal source of liquidity at march  consisted of million in cash and short term marketable securities plus million available under the existing line of credit 
the company believes that funds generated from operations  its cash and marketable securities and funds available under its line of credit will be adequate to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal impact of year general description of the year issue and the nature and effects of the year on information technology it and non it systems the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs  hardware or embedded chips that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on recent assessments  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its distribution  finance and manufacturing software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications or replacements of certain existing software and hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following key phases inventory  assessment and remediation 
the company has categorized its systems into several areas core systems ie distribution  finance and manufacturing systems  ancillary support systems to those core systems  embedded systems  products  and third party vendors 
inventory and assessment the company has completed its inventory and assessment of both its domestic and international core systems  indicating most of the core systems would be adversely affected 
for the ancillary support systems and embedded systems  the company has completed its inventory and assessment 
this identified two items that need to be updated 
the company has completed its inventory and assessment of its product lines and has determined that most of the products it has sold and will continue to sell do not require remediation to be year compliant 
accordingly  the company does not believe that the year presents a material exposure as it relates to the company s products 
status of progress in becoming year compliant for its domestic core system exposures related to its distribution  finance and manufacturing software  the company has completed all required remediation 
for other domestic core systems  such as desktop computers  networks and off the shelf application software  the company is complete on the remediation phase and expects to complete upgrades and or replacement no later than october  the remediation of the identified ancillary and embedded systems is expected to be complete no later than october  nature and level of importance of third parties and their exposure to the year other than payroll and its banking relationships  the company has no other significant direct interfaces with third party vendors 
the company is in the process of working with key third party vendors to ensure that the company s systems that interface directly with third party vendors are year compliant by december  the company understands that key vendors are in the process of making their systems year compliant 
each vendor queried by the company believed that its system would be year compliant by the end of the company is beginning to query its significant suppliers and subcontractors that do not share information systems with the company external agents 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the inability of external agents to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by external agents is not determinable at this time 
costs the total cost to the company of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
to date  the company has incurred costs of approximately million 
this amount includes upgrading its desktop systems and office software to the latest release  which the company would do in the normal course of business 
the majority of these costs relate to new hardware and software and are being capitalized 
risks management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases  the company would be constrained in taking customer orders  and might be unable to manufacture and ship certain products  or invoice customers 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
contingency plans the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of the year program 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion in june and determine whether such a plan is necessary 
factors that may affect future results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this management s discussion are forward looking statements  the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the discussion of such matters in the forward looking statements 
due to the nature of the company s products and business  the company has been and will be involved in various legal actions arising in the course of business  some of which involve product liability and intellectual property claims 
with respect to product liability issues  the litigation and regulatory risks will continue to exist even with respect to those products that have received or in the future may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
it is possible that adverse results arising from product liability or intellectual property actions  as well as adverse results arising from regulatory or administrative proceedings could negatively affect the company s future results of operations 
the company has been and may be in the future the subject of negative publicity  which can arise from various sources  ranging from the news media to legislative and regulatory investigations 
there can be no assurance that such negative publicity will not result in a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position  its results of operations or the market price of its stock 
in addition  significant negative publicity could result in an increase in product liability claims 
the company s products  development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
in the united states  the fda regulates the introduction  manufacturing  labeling and record keeping procedures for medical devices 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance from the fda for new products and existing products can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that such clearances will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize additional products or additional applications for existing products 
in addition  certain of the company s products that are in the research and development stage may be subject to a lengthy and expensive pre market approval pma process with the fda 
product approvals by the fda can also be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval 
the fda could also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products and has the power to require the recall of such products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation  and there can be no assurance that future interpretations made by the fda or other regulatory bodies will not adversely affect the company 
the fda  various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with various regulations relating to manufacturing practices  validation  testing  quality control and product labeling 
a determination that the company is in violation of such regulations could lead to imposition of penalties  product recalls  consent decrees or product seizures 
each of the company s major business segments operates its manufacturing  warehousing and research and development activities in a single facility 
while the company has some limited protection in the form of basic insurance coverage  the company s operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected in the event of a fire or similar catastrophe 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company maintains a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents  with maturities of three months or less as of the date of purchase 
the company also has current marketable securities consisting primarily of municipal bonds that are of limited credit risk and have contractual maturities of less than two years 
given the short term nature of these investments  the company is not subject to significant interest rate risk 
a portion of the company s operations consists of sales activities in foreign markets 
the company manufactures its products primarily in the united states and sells them outside the us through a combination of international distributors and eight wholly owned sales offices 
sales to third party distributors and to the wholly owned sales offices are in us dollars 
the sales offices invoice their customers in their local currency 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in those foreign markets 
the principal exposure on sales to third party distributors stems from the potential for weak economic conditions in the foreign market  thus weakening the foreign currency  decreasing the customer s buying power and potentially decreasing the company s sales 
the company s exposure on sales to its subsidiaries consists of the exposure related to the weakening of local currency when payment of the trade payable is made  thus translating into more local currency needed to pay off the us denominated payable than when it was recorded  lowering the subsidiaries earnings and upon translation of the subsidiaries monthly financial statements  that a weakening local currency would cause lower market sales to be recorded in us dollars that what have occurred had the currency been stable as compared to the us dollar 
however  in the latter instance  operating expenses would also be translated at lower amounts and accordingly  the effect on net income would be mitigated 
the company does not currently hedge any of these exposures
