item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview natural gas and oil prices  the offshore mobile rig count and gulf of mexico lease activity are three of the primary indicators management uses to predict the level of the company s business 
cdi s construction services generally follow successful drilling activities by six to eighteen months on the continental shelf and twelve to twenty four in the deepwater arena 
the level of drilling activity is related to both short and long term trends in natural gas and oil prices 
recently commodity prices have declined significantly resulting in the utilization of offshore mobile rigs dropping to approximately in contrast to almost full utilization in and the first half of should this period of low oil and gas prices persist  demand for the company s services could be negatively impacted in product prices impact the company s natural gas and oil operations in several respects 
the company seeks to acquire producing natural gas and oil properties that are generally in the later stages of their economic life 
these properties typically have few  if any  unexplored drilling locations  so the potential abandonment liability is a significant consideration with respect to the offshore properties which the company has purchased to date 
although higher natural gas prices tend to reduce the number of mature properties available for sale  these higher prices contributed to improved operating results for the company in and in contrast  lower natural gas prices  as experienced in  contributed to lower operating results for ert in and has increased the number of mature properties available for sale such that the company has completed three transactions involving interests in offshore blocks early in salvage operations consist of platform decommissioning  removal and abandonment and p a services performed by the company s salvage assets  ie  a stiff leg derrick barge and well servicing equipment 
in addition  salvage related support  such as debris removal and preparation of platform legs for removal  is often provided by the company s surface diving vessels 
in  management targeted platform removal and salvage operations as a regulatory driven activity which offers a partial hedge against fluctuations in the commodity price of natural gas 
in particular  mms regulations require removal of platforms within twelve months after lease expiration and also require remediation of the seabed at the well site to its original state 
the company contracts and manages  on a turnkey basis  all aspects of the decommissioning and abandonment of fields of all sizes using third party heavy lift derrick barges if necessary 
the company has entered into an alliance with horizon offshore gaining access to expanded derrick barge and pipelay capacity 
in this regard cal dive has guaranteed a certain level of barge activity which it expects to use in conjunction with cdi salvage operations 
the following table sets forth for the periods presented i average us natural gas prices  ii the company s natural gas production  iii the average number of offshore rigs under contract in the gulf of mexico  iv the number of platforms installed and removed in the gulf of mexico and v the vessel utilization rates for each of the major categories of the company s fleet

average vessel utilization rate is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels in this category generated revenues by the total number of days in each quarter 
vessel utilization is historically lower during the first quarter due to winter weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  the company plans its drydock inspections and other routine and preventive maintenance programs during this period 
during the first quarter  a substantial number of the company s customers finalize capital budgets and solicit bids for construction projects 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
as a result  the company has historically generated more than up to of its consolidated revenues in the last six months of the year 
the company s operations can also be severely impacted by weather during the fourth quarter 
the company s salvage barge  which has a shallow draft  is particularly sensitive to adverse weather conditions  and its utilization rate will be lower during such periods 
to minimize the impact of weather conditions on the company s operations and financial condition  cdi began operating dp vessels and expanded into the acquisition of mature offshore properties 
the unique station keeping ability offered by dynamic positioning enables these vessels to operate throughout the winter months and in rough seas 
operation of natural gas and oil properties tends to offset the impact of weather since the first and fourth quarters are typically periods of high demand for natural gas and of strong natural gas prices 
due to this seasonality  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
consolidated revenues of million in were more than the million earned during with the subsea operations contributing all of the increase while natural gas and oil production revenues declined million 
all of the increase was due to increased demand for services provided by cdi s dp vessels  particularly the uncle john  witch queen and balmoral sea which together contributed of the increase 
in addition  new vessels sea sorceress and merlin contributed million of the increase 
the charter of two coflexip stena offshore vessels  the marianos during the first quarter and the constructor in the second  added million to the revenues 
natural gas and oil production was million in as compared to million in the decrease was due to a decline in production from bcfe billion of cubic feet equivalent during to bcfe in and a decline in average gas prices from mcf for to mcf during the decline in production is a result of five wells going off line in the second quarter and remedial work being delayed into the fourth quarter by a lack of equipment and then by weather 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  from million in to million in with the uncle john  witch queen and balmoral sea making up the majority of the increase 
the remaining increase was due to improved demand for the two saturation diving vessels and the vessels which work in the shallow gulf of mexico from the shore to feet of water 
subsea and salvage margins increased from in to during due mainly to outstanding offshore performance and demand for the dp vessels 
natural gas and oil production gross profit was million in as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease was due to the aforementioned declines in average natural gas prices and production during as compared to and to expensive efforts to re establish production in the second half of the year 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million to million in as compared to the million includes a million provision principally for incentive compensation compared to million provided in the remainder of the increase is due to the addition of new personnel to support the company s deepwater strategy  growth in it base business and to the cost of a supply chain management consulting project 
selling and administrative costs were of revenues in  a level identical to that in other income and expenses 
the company recorded million in reflecting its share of earnings of aquatica  inc net interest income and other of million for compares to  of net interest expense and other for this improvement was due to the company remaining debt free since completion of its initial public offering of common stock in july  income taxes 
income taxes were million in as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase was due to the company s increased profitability as the effective tax rate remained in both years 
roughly of the tax provision was deferred due mainly to increased depreciation in addition to the company s deepwater research and development efforts 
net income 
net income increased to million in as compared to million in as a result of factors described above 
diluted earnings per share increased percentage points less than the net income increase in  as compared to  due to the impact on weighted average common shares outstanding of the new shares issued in the july ipo 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
consolidated revenues of million in were more than the million reported during due primarily to the addition of dp vessels  improved demand for traditional subsea services and increased natural gas and oil production 
revenues from dp vessels increased to million in as compared to prior year due to the full year operations of the balmoral sea and uncle john vessels placed in service in april and october   respectively 
this increase  combined with stronger market conditions for surface diving and supply boats offset the impact of seven vessels being out of service for a combined weeks during the first two quarters of for regulatory inspections  preventative maintenance and or vessel upgrades 
in addition  six weeks of downtime were experienced during the third quarter of due to a lightning strike on the witch queen and an electrical fire on the cal diver ii 
during only two cdi vessels were out of service for any significant length of time 
revenue from natural gas and oil production was million for the year ended from properties as compared to million in from nine properties 
the revenue benefited from prior year well enhancement efforts 
average gas sales prices improved slightly in compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  from million in to million in the addition of the uncle john and balmoral sea to the company s fleet were responsible for over half of the increase 
the remaining increase was due to improved demand for traditional subsea services and increased natural gas and oil production 
subsea margins were unchanged between and despite the company encountering difficulties on a large construction project in the third quarter of and the unusually active regulatory inspection and maintenance program which resulted in subsea repair costs of million as compared to million in natural gas and oil production gross profit was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase was due mainly to the acquisition of five blocks during the second half of and the gain recorded on the sale of two properties during the second quarter of selling administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in as compared to the increase was due mainly to the addition of new personnel to support the company s deepwater strategy and growth in its base business and to higher levels of subsea bonuses 
the remainder of the increase was due to the ert incentive compensation program whereby key management personnel share in the improved earnings of the natural gas and oil production segment 
selling and administrative expenses were of revenues  an improvement from in net interest 
net interest expense decreased by  from  in to  in due mainly to the company retiring all debt in july with the proceeds received from the ipo 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement averaged million during as compared to million during income taxes 
income taxes were million for as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase was due to the company s increased profitability 
higher depreciation related to the newly acquired dp vessels resulted in a reduction of the amount of cash taxes paid as a percentage of pre tax income in compared to and also a corresponding increase in the deferred tax liability 
net income 
net income increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in as a result of factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically funded its operating activities principally from internally generated cash flow  even during industry depressed years such as and an initial public offering of common stock was completed on july   with the sale of  shares generating net proceeds to the company of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and issuance costs 
the proceeds were used to fund capital expenditures during  and to repay all outstanding long term indebtedness 
as of december   the company had million of working capital including million of cash on hand and no debt outstanding after funding the equity investment in aquatica and million of capital expenditures in  which includes ert s purchase of six blocks offshore 
subsequent to year end cdi s cash on hand increased to million at january  additionally  cdi has approximately million available under a revolving credit agreement 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to million provided in this increase is primarily the result of increased profitability of the company and a decline in the level of funding required to fund accounts receivable increases million required in compared to  returned in 
other current assets increased million at december  as compared to december  due mainly to the purchases of materials and supplies for the new full field development program 
the company experienced improved collections of its accounts receivable during as compared to the prior year 
total accounts receivable decreased  at december  as compared to december  while revenues grew in compared to the company s average number of days to bill and collect its trade receivables decreased by days in as compared to while losses from customer inability to pay bad debt expenses have historically been insignificant  the current downturn in commodity prices could result in bankruptcy or liquidation of certain of the smaller production companies that operate in the gulf 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to million provided in this increase was primarily the result of increased profitability and a decline in the level of funding required to fund accounts receivable increases million required in compared to million in 
in addition  depreciation and amortization increased as a result of vessel and natural gas and oil properties acquisitions 
investing activities 
capital expenditures have consisted principally of strategic asset acquisitions  the assembly of a fleet of dp vessels  including the witch queen  balmoral sea  uncle john  sea sorceress and merlin  improvements to existing vessels and the acquisition of offshore natural gas and oil properties 
the company incurred million of capital expenditures during in january  ert acquired interests in six blocks involving two separate fields from sonat exploration company for million and assumption of sonat s pro rata share of the related decommissioning liability 
the remaining balance includes costs associated with placing the merlin in service and additions to the sea sorceress in preparation for the terra nova project as well as the cost of new steel and equipment added to the witch queen  balmoral sea and cal diver v during drydock inspections 
in february  the company purchased a significant minority equity investment in aquatica  inc a surface diving company for million  in addition to a commitment to lend additional funds of million to allow aquatica to purchase vessels and fund other growth opportunities 
dependent upon various preconditions  as defined  the shareholders of aquatica have the right to convert their shares into cal dive shares at a ratio based on a formula which  among other things  values their interest in aquatica and must be accretive to cal dive shareholders 
the company incurred million of capital expenditures during during the third quarter  the company acquired a foot by foot ice strengthened vessel the sea sorceress as a dp conversion candidate 
during the fourth quarter  the company acquired a foot by foot dp vessel the merlin purpose built for long term rov  survey and coring support 
the remaining capital expenditures included the acquisition of two work class rovs from coflexip  the costs associated with installation of a derrick on the uncle john and the cash portion of the fourth quarter natural gas and oil properties acquisition discussed below 
during  the company had seven vessels out of service for either regulatory inspection or upgrade programs compared to only two during during the fourth quarter of  the company sold two offshore natural gas and oil properties for approximately  and during the second quarter of  the company sold two offshore natural gas and oil properties for approximately million 
these transactions were structured as section like kind exchanges for tax purposes 
accordingly  the cash received was restricted to use for subsequent acquisitions of additional natural gas and oil properties 
since  including the transactions closed subsequent to year end  the company has invested million to acquire offshore natural gas and oil leases 
the company records the amount of cash paid together with the abandonment liability assumed at the time such properties are acquired 
only the cash paid at closing is reflected in the company s statement of cash flows together with bond and escrow deposits required in connection with these purchases 
the minerals management service requires operators in the gulf of mexico to post an areawide bond of million 
beginning in the mms allowed the company to utilize an insurance carrier to provide such bonding 
in addition  certain of the purchase and sale agreements have required the company to fund portions of the estimated decommissioning liability 
accordingly  the company s balance sheet as of december  included million of cash deposits restricted for abandonment obligations 
in addition  the company had also issued letters of credit totaling  at december  in lieu of cash deposits in connection with property acquisitions 
in january and march  the company acquired  in three separate transactions  interests in blocks including wells and assumed the responsibility to decommission the properties in full compliance with all governmental regulations 
the decommissioning obligations assumed in these transactions were such that a cash outlay was not required 
the company has had  and anticipates having additional discussions with third parties regarding possible acquisitions including natural gas and oil properties and vessels 
however  the company can give no assurance that any such transaction can be completed 
financing activities 
the company has financed seasonal operating requirements and capital expenditures with internally generated funds  borrowings under credit facilities  and the sale of common stock described above 
the revolving credit agreement  as amended  currently provides for a million revolving line of credit 
the revolving credit agreement  which terminates in december  is secured by trade receivables and mortgages on the company s vessels 
the revolving credit agreement prohibits the payment of dividends on the company s capital stock and contains only one financial covenant a fixed charge coverage ratio and a limitation that debt not exceed million 
interest on borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is equal to prime with incentive pricing thereafter pursuant to a formula based upon ebitda as defined therein 
no borrowings were outstanding at december  letters of credit are also available under the revolving credit agreement which the company typically uses if performance bonds are required or  in certain cases  in lieu of purchasing us treasury bonds in conjunction with gas and oil property acquisitions 
the only financing activity in represents the exercise of stock options 
during the first two quarters of  the company repaid million  net of its borrowings under its revolving credit agreement with fleet capital corporation and in the third quarter repaid the remaining million outstanding with proceeds from the initial public offering of common stock 
also  during the second quarter the company completed a transaction with coflexip whereby coflexip agreed to accept treasury shares as payment for two rovs added in february 
capital commitments 
in connection with its business strategy  management expects the company to acquire or build additional vessels  acquire other assets such as rovs  as well as seek to buy additional natural gas and oil properties 
the company has purchased the thrusters and completed engineering for the conversion of the sea sorceress to full dp  however  this to million capital expenditure will not be undertaken until commodity prices and market conditions improve 
the company has also announced that it is considering building a new deepwater construction vessel  the q depending upon the size of any future acquisitions  the company may require additional debt financing  possibly in excess of the revolving credit agreement  as amended  or additional equity financing 
other than building  converting or buying dp vessels  management believes existing cash balances  the net cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will be adequate to meet funding requirements for the next year 
year readiness disclosure the company has assessed what computer software will require modification or replacement so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company has purchased  and has implemented  a new project management accounting system which is year compliant 
this system  which fully integrates all of its modules  provides project managers and accounting personnel with up to date information enabling them to better control jobs in addition to providing benefits in inventory control and planned vessel maintenance 
cdi s vessel computer dp systems are partially dependent on government satellites and the government has not yet confirmed that they have solved year data problems 
if necessary  the vessels could operate for sometime safely on redundant systems other than satellite information 
accordingly  the company believes that the year issue will be resolved in a timely manner and presently does not believe that the cost to become year compliant will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the foregoing statements are intended to be and are hereby designated year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information readiness and disclosure act 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosure about market risk not applicable because  at december   the company was not engaged in any transactions requiring disclosure under this item
