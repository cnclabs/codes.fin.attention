quarterly results and seasonality the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant quarterly variations in operating results  principally as a result of the timing of clients telemarketing campaigns  the commencement and expiration of contracts  the timing and amount of new business generated by the company  the company s revenue mix  the timing of additional selling  general and administrative expenses to support the growth and development of existing and new business units and the competitive conditions in the telemarketing industry 
the company s business tends to be strongest in the fourth quarter due to the high level of client telemarketing activity prior to the holiday season 
in the first quarter  business generally levels off or slows from the previous quarter as a result of reduced telemarketing activities and client transitions to new marketing programs during the first quarter of the calendar year 
in addition  the company typically expands it s operations in the first quarter to support anticipated business growth beginning in the second quarter 
as a result  selling  general and administrative costs typically increase in the first quarter without a commensurate increase in revenues which results in decreased profitability for the first quarter versus the previous fourth quarter 
also  demand for the company s services typically slows or decreases in the third quarter as the volume of telemarketing projects decreases during the summer months

the company s telemarketing activities will continue to require significant capital expenditures

the lease obligations are payable in varying installments through outstanding obligations under capitalized leases at december  were million 
in  the company signed a three year  million credit agreement with bankboston  na and summit bancorp 
at december   outstanding obligations under the credit agreement were million  leaving million available to the company 
the company believes that cash on hand  together with cash flow generated from operations and funds available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to finance its current operations and planned capital expenditures at least through year compliance the year problem describes the concern that certain computer applications  which use two digits rather than four to represent dates  will interpret the year as and malfunction on january  in this section  ict group summarizes the expected impact of the year problem on the company 
ict group s internal systems ict group has evaluated its information technology infrastructure and has developed a plan to ensure its year compliance 
this plan includes  among other things  retiring several systems to be replaced with new internally developed year compliant software systems  upgrading the remaining software systems to be year compliant and  if necessary  upgrading the company s hardware systems to be year compliant 
these efforts are planned for completion by september  and the company expects to meet this deadline 
ict group also is evaluating information regarding its non information technology infrastructure office building systems  copiers  etc 
for year readiness 
information received to date indicates that this infrastructure will be year compliant by the end of readiness of third parties ict group has requested information from all its third party vendors on their year readiness to determine the extent to which their failure to remedy their own year problems will affect the company 
the information ict group had received from its third party vendors to date indicates that they will be year compliant by the end of cost of year compliance as of december   the company incurred approximately  of costs in addressing the year issue 
the company also currently expects the total costs to become year will not exceed million 
approximately half of these costs have been or will be charged to expense and the balance will be for new equipment  which will be capitalized 
risk associated with the year the magnitude of the company s year problem  the costs of the company s year project and the dates on which the company believes it will complete its year compliance are based on management s knowledge to date and its best estimates 
the company is not aware  at this time  of any year non compliance issues related to the company that will not be fixed by the year which would materially affect the company 
however  these estimates were derived using numerous assumptions and some risks that the company faces include the failure of internal information systems  defects in its work environment  and an inability of telecommunications carriers to supply telecommunication services 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel  the ability to identify and correct all year impacted areas  and other similar uncertainties 
contingency plans the company is in the process of developing contingency plans to address a worst case year scenario 
this contingency plan is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its long term debt obligations 
the fixed rate of on the company s long term debt at december  approximates market rates  thus  the fair value of the debt approximates its reported value 
in the past the company has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rates swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  it may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and the company s ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
foreign currency risk the company does not use foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
the company has operations in canada  ireland  and the united kingdom which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of income statements of these operations from local currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
the company s foreign operations represent of the company s consolidated revenues for the year ended december  in addition  foreign operations produced of the call volume associated with domestic revenues 
management does not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations is not expected to be material
