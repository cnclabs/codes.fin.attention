item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations are significantly affected by the timing of the award of contracts  the timing of performance on contracts  and the extent to which the company s employees are performing billable tasks as opposed to engaging in preparing contract proposals  bids and other required non billable activities 
results of operations may also be affected to the extent that the company chooses not to reduce its professional staff during a period of reduced demand for its services 
due to these factors  quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for longer periods 
the company  in the course of providing its services  routinely subcontracts such services as drilling  laboratory analyses  and other specialized services 
in addition  as described in the general section of item  the use of teaming partners for the performance of services similar to those of the company  is included in subcontracts 
in accordance with industry practice and contract terms that generally provide for the recovery of overhead costs  these costs are passed directly through to clients and are included in total revenue 
because subcontractor costs and direct charges can change significantly from project to project  the change in total revenue is not necessarily a true indication of business trends 
accordingly  the company considers net revenue  which is total revenue less subcontractor costs  as its primary measure of revenue 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of selected items in the consolidated statement of continued operations to net revenue for the years indicated 
the table has been adjusted to show the relationship of continued operations for each year and does not include results of the discontinued analytical services segment

however  as a result of lower net revenue  direct salaries and other operating costs as a percentage of net revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales  general and administrative costs decreased to  or of net revenue  in fiscal from  or of net revenue  for the twelve months ended august  the decrease is due to lower sales and marketing related costs incurred as a result of strategic initiatives made in fiscal these initiatives included a restructuring in the second quarter reducing personnel and implementing a regional sales organization to support the decentralization of ea s marketing and business development program 
in the prior period ended august   the company recorded a gain of  reducing its operating expenses 
the gain was related to the increase in the cash surrender value of key employee life insurance policies included in the company s balance sheet 
to address the company s high overhead in relation to net revenue  in february  the company implemented several cost cutting measures to effect its long term profitability objectives by aligning expenses more directly with revenues 
in connection with the restructuring  the company incurred a one time charge of  related primarily to severance agreements of staff members including several senior sales and executive staff 
as a result of the above factors  the loss from continuing operations for the twelve months ended august  was  or of net revenue  compared to income from continuing operations in the prior fiscal period of  or of net revenue 
interest expense  net  increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a higher line of credit balance used to fund operating activity 
for the twelve months ended august   the company had a benefit from income taxes of  compared to a provision for income taxes of  in the prior fiscal year 
this represents an effective rate of in fiscal year and in fiscal the net loss from continued operations for the twelve months ended august  was  or of net revenue  compared to a net income from continued operations of  or in the prior fiscal period 
for the twelve months ended august   the company had a net loss from its discontinued analytical services segment of  included in this loss was a net gain of  on the sale of the segment 
the discontinued segment in the prior fiscal period had a net loss of  as a result of the above  the company had an overall loss of  or of net revenue for the twelve months ended august   compared to net income of  or  in the prior fiscal period 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue from continued operations during fiscal decreased to  from  the decrease in net revenue was due to lower than anticipated sales in the industrial sector 
although sales and marketing efforts targeted this market and won approximately new clients  larger volume projects were not achieved as of the end of the fiscal period 
lower industrial sector sales were offset by improved net sales in the federal  state and local government  and utility sectors 
direct salaries and other operating costs decreased to  in from  in  or and of net revenue  respectively 
the decreases were attributable to increased staff utilization and lower overall non labor operating costs 
the company maintained a utilization rate time charged to clients of more than for its technical staff and an overall company rate of 
significant savings were also achieved by lowering equipment and property lease costs by  in fiscal compared to fiscal these savings were achieved by subletting unused facilities  renegotiating existing leases  and changing to a different supplier for computer related items 
sales  general and administrative costs increased to  in from  in  or and of net revenue  respectively 
the increase in cost was primarily related to additional investment in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal compared to the prior year 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a gain of  which reduced its operating expenses 
the gain was related to the increase in the cash surrender value of key employee life insurance policies included on the company s balance sheet 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company implemented a major organizational realignment to reposition itself in the marketplace

this restructuring included a staff reduction of employees 
during fiscal  the company incurred  in operating related costs that were associated with the fy restructuring and charged against the reserve instead of income 
as a result of the above factors  the income from continued operations in fiscal was  compared to a loss from continued operations of  in the prior year

inflation because of its ability to generally pass through increased costs to its clients  as well as the generally low levels of inflation  the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents cash increased by  in  compared to a decrease of  in and an increase of  in the increase in principally resulted from the borrowings against the company s line of credit used for operating activities 
increased borrowings to fund operating activities became necessary during the year as revenue began to decline due to multi year federal contracts reaching completion without being replaced by new contracts 
as a result  the company s revenue was no longer capable of maintaining the current overhead structure of the company 
to address this problem  the company made several strategic initiatives to reduce annual operating expenses by approximately million 
the restructuring included a staff reduction of approximately employees including several officers of the company 
additionally  the company sold its ea laboratories division for cash during the quarter ended may  proceeds from the sale  as well as restructuring efforts  helped decrease the line of credit balance by  from  as of february  to  as of august  the company anticipates a further reduction in its line of credit balance during the next several quarters  as revenues exceed operating expenses and restructuring commitments end 
the company s capital expenditures consisting primarily of purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately   and  in  and  respectively  have been funded primarily from cash flows 
the company maintains a bank credit arrangement with a regional bank consisting of i an  revolving line of credit secured by receivables  ii a  term loan  and iii an equipment line of credit of  of the  revolving line of credit   is available for acquisitions  joint ventures and licensing agreements 
borrowings from the revolving line of credit are limited to certain percent ages of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings up to a maximum of 
the interest on all borrowings is libor at august   the company had outstanding long term debt  including the current portion  of  which represented an increase of  from the august  balance of  the increase is the result of a  increase in its revolving line of credit as described in the previous paragraph  partially offset by net repayment of  for equipment and computer loans 
the company had no short term borrowings under its line of credit at august  and the company s existing funds  cash from operations  and the available portion of its  bank line of credit and  equipment line are expected to be sufficient to meet the company s present cash needs 
the company also currently believes it has the ability to raise capital through placement of debt and may pursue such options if the need arises to expand facilities  make acquisitions or acquire equipment in conjunction with a review of the most cost effective means for the company and its stockholders 
while the company believes that there is sufficient demand for current operating levels  there can be no assurance that this demand will exist or continue 
although the company has the ability to reduce its professional staff in periods of reduced demand  it may choose not to make full reductions in such periods  with resulting adverse effects on operations 
year readiness disclosure ea recognizes the seriousness of the challenge businesses worldwide face as a result of the year problem 
ea has had a formal  thorough and aggressive year project since early as a result of these efforts  the company believes that all of its mission critical systems are year compliant 
ea also believes the measures taken will minimize any impact on its ability to deliver services to its clients or its financial performance 
based on the successful completion of the year compliance program  the company does not foresee significant risks associated with year at this time 
a 
assessment and remediation during fiscal  ea developed and implemented a three phase program for year compliance 
phase i identified those systems  hardware and software  that posed a potential compliance risk for ea 
ea completed all phase i assessment in mid phase ii assessed the business and financial impact of these at risk systems  established priorities to address these risk areas  and proscribed remediation schedules and details 
phase ii was completed during the fall of phase iii carried out the prescribed remediation schedules and performed final testing of the major systems to ensure compliance 
phase iii began in september of and concluded in november the company believes that all major systems  wide and local area networks  and desktop pcs are compliant at this time 
b 
testing ea has tested and will continue to test  the year worthiness of each system on an on going basis 
this compliance testing is comprised of three independent assessments first  a review all of the product manufacturer s year compliance testing certifications and results no product is selected unless it has been identified by the manufacturer to have passed a comprehensive battery of year tests  second  testing of these products prior to installation  third  independent audit and assessment  using third party auditing software and independent consultants dedicated to year compliance 
testing has been completed on every ea system  including networks and communications  major applications  desktop computers and applications  and non computer related systems 
c 
risks and contingency plans the company has developed thorough contingency plans to address events that may arise within or outside of the company 
the remainder of calendar year will be focused on ensuring the readiness of these contingency plans and addressing any remaining  presently unknown issue that may arise 
d 
third party vendors  utilities and customers the fact that ea provides environmental consulting services  which are primarily labor based  substantially minimizes its risk associated with potential year problems with its internal systems and its suppliers 
the company maintains a broad base of vendors and suppliers and believes there is little risk to its ongoing operations from year problems by its outside vendors 
ea has contacted each of its major vendors and clients to secure statements of year compliance 
the vendors and clients who have responded to date have assured ea of the adequacy and timeliness of their year preparations 
additionally ea has incorporated year compliance clauses into it and subcontractor agreements since early the company cannot fully assess the degree to which its customers  particularly the us government  will successfully complete a year upgrade on a timely basis 
because a significant portion of the company s business is from contracts with various federal government agencies  a failure by the us government to achieve year compliance could have a significant adverse effect on the company s future business  financial operations and results of operations 
e 
reasonably likely worst case scenarios due to the magnitude and complexity of the year problem  even the most conscientious and diligent efforts cannot guarantee that every problem has been found and remediated prior to january  ea believes that it has addressed every year problem known at this time 
ea is confident no significant year issues remain and that it can address any as yet undiscovered year problems quickly 
ea has gone to significant lengths to provide redundancy in each major system 
a failure in any single major system will not result in the cessation of normal work processes 
the failure of any single system will pose only a minimal risk 
for the reasons stated above  ea does not presently anticipate that the year phenomenon will cause any significant disruption to its business  financial operations or results of operations 
however  if the company s customers or subcontractors fail to prepare adequately for year  there could be numerous and significant effects on ea 
for example  subcontractors may not be able to obtain or deliver needed data  ea employees might be unable to perform work  resulting in a loss of revenue  and payments may fail to arrive on time 
any or all of these contingencies could  under certain circumstances  result in a substantial and material impact on ea s financial performance 
costs to address year issues the company has not incurred and presently believes that it will not likely incur  material costs in connection with effectuating year compliance 
this is because replacement of major applications was previously planned to improve performance and functionality requirements 
these replacements were not accelerated due to year issues  as such the costs of these systems are part of the company s capital budget 
the company currently estimates the cost of remediating its software and non it systems at approximately  of which  has already been spent 
the company does not separately track the internal costs for the yk project  such costs are principally the related payroll costs for its information systems group
