item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
certain of the statements contained below are forward looking statements rather than historical facts that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
general on december   the company and peoples telephone merged together in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as such  the results of both companies have been restated as if they had been combined for all periods presented 
during  the company derived its revenues from two principal sources coin calls and non coin calls 
coin calls represent calls paid for by callers with coins deposited in the payphone 
coin call revenues are recorded in the amount of coins collected from the payphones 
non coin calls made from the company s payphones generate revenues in an amount that depends upon whether the company or a long distance company handles the call 
if the non coin call is handled by the company through its switch or an unbundled services arrangement  the company recognizes non coin revenues equal to the total amount charged for the call 
if the non coin call is handled by a long distance company  the company generally recognizes revenues in an amount equal to the commission on that call paid to the company by the long distance company 
under an unbundled services arrangement  the company performs certain functions necessary to service non coin calls  uses the long distance company s switching equipment and its other services on an as needed basis  and pays the long distance company on an unbundled basis for the operator services actually used to complete these calls 
the company also recognizes non coin revenues from calls that are dialed from its payphones to gain access to a long distance company other than the one pre programmed into the telephone  this is commonly referred to as dial around access 
see business regulation 
the company also derives revenue from certain lecs for intralata non coin calls 
see business operations 
the principal costs related to the ongoing operation of the company s payphones include telephone charges  commissions  and service  maintenance and network costs 
telephone charges consist of payments made by the company to lecs and long distance carriers for access charges and use of their networks 
commission expense represents payments to location owners 
service  maintenance and network costs represent the cost of servicing and maintaining the payphones on an ongoing basis  costs related to the operation of the company s switch and  in connection with unbundled services arrangements  the fees paid for those services 
regulatory impact on revenue local coin rates in ensuring fair compensation for all calls  the fcc previously determined that local coin rates from payphones should be generally deregulated by october   but provided for possible modifications or exemptions from deregulation upon a detailed showing by an individual state that there are market failures within the state that would not allow market based rates to develop 
on july   a federal court issued an order which upheld the fcc s authority to deregulate local coin call rates 
in accordance with the fcc s ruling and the court order  certain lecs and independent payphone service providers  including the company  increased rates for local coin calls from 
to 
given the lack of direction on the part of the fcc on specific requirements for obtaining a state exemption  the company s inability to predict the responses of individual states or the market  and the company s inability to provide assurance that deregulation  if and where implemented  will lead to higher local coin call rates  the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact on its operations of local coin rate deregulation 
in  the company experienced lower coin call volumes on its payphones resulting from the increased rates  growth in wireless communication services and changes in call traffic and the geographic mix of the company s payphones 
dial around compensation on september   the federal communications commission fcc adopted rules which became effective november  the payphone order  initially mandating dial around compensation for both access code calls and subscriber calls at a flat rate of per payphone per month calls multiplied by per call 
commencing october  and ending october  the per payphone per month rate was to transition to a per call system at the rate of per call 
several parties challenged certain of the fcc regulations including the dial around compensation rate 
on july   a federal court vacated certain portions of the fcc s payphone order  including the dial around compensation rate 
in accordance with the court s mandate  on october   the fcc adopted a second order the payphone order  establishing a rate of per call for the first two years of per call compensation october  through october  
the ixcs were required to pay this per call amount to payphone service providers  including the company  beginning october  on may   the court again remanded the per call compensation rate to the fcc for further explanation without vacating the 
default rate 
in accordance with the court s second mandate  on february   the fcc released a third order the payphone order  in which the fcc abandoned its efforts to derive a market based default dial around compensation rate and instead adopted a cost based rate of 
per dial around call 
this rate will become effective on april   and will serve as a default rate through january  the new rate will also be applied retroactively to the period beginning on october   less a 
amount to account for flex ani payphone tracking costs  for a net compensation rate of 
applicable during this retroactive period 
it also appears from the payphone order that this new rate will be applied to the initial interim period  running from november  through october   however  the payphone order deferred a final ruling on the interim period treatment to a later  as yet unreleased  order 
upon establishment of the interim period  the fcc has further ruled that a true up will be made for all payments or credits with applicable interest at due and owing between the ixcs and the psps  including the company  for the payment period commencing on november  through the effective date of the new 
per call rate 
based on the fcc s conclusion in the payphone order  the company adjusted the amounts of dial around compensation previously recorded for the period november  to june  from the initial rate to per call multiplied by calls 
as a result of this adjustment  the provision recorded in the year ended december  for reduced dial around compensation is approximately million 
for periods beginning november   prior to the release of the payphone order  the company has recorded dial around compensation at the rate of per payphone per month 
the company believes that it is legally entitled to fair compensation under the telecommunications act for dial around calls which the company delivered to any carrier during the period from november  to october  based on the information available  the company believes that the minimum amount it is entitled to as fair compensation under the telecommunications act for the period from november  to october  is per payphone per month calls multiplied by per call and the company  based on the information available to it  does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the amount will be materially less than per payphone per month 
while the amount of per call constitutes the company s assessment of the minimum level of fair compensation following the april  effective date  certain ixcs have asserted in the past  are asserting and are expected to assert in the future that the appropriate level of fair compensation should be lower than per call 
the payment levels for dial around calls prescribed in the and payphone orders significantly increase dial around compensation revenues to the company over the levels received prior to implementation of the telecommunications act although the payphone order has now moderated those increases 
however  market forces and factors outside the company s control could significantly affect these revenue increases 
these factors include the following i the final resolution of the 
rate recently ordered by the fcc and the possibility of subsequent appeals to the courts  ii the resolution by the fcc of the method of allocating the initial interim period flat rate assessment among the ixcs and the number of calls to be used in determining the amount of the assessment  iii the possibility of other litigation seeking to modify or overturn the payphone order or portions thereof  iv the ixcs reaction to the fcc s recognition that existing regulations do not prohibit an ixc from blocking subscriber numbers from payphones in order to avoid paying per call compensation on such calls  and v ongoing technical or other difficulties in the responsible carriers ability and willingness to properly track or pay for dial around calls actually delivered to them

credit agreement in connection with the merger with peoples telephone on december   the company entered into a senior credit facility senior credit facility with nationsbank  na the administrative agent and the other lenders named therein 
the senior credit facility provides for borrowings by davel from time to time of up to million for working capital and other corporate purposes 
indebtedness of the company under the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of its and its subsidiaries assets  including but not limited to their equipment  inventory  receivables and related contracts  investment property  computer hardware and software  bank accounts and all other goods and rights of every kind and description and is guaranteed by davel and all its subsidiaries 
the company s borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a floating rate and may be maintained as base rate loans as defined in the senior credit facility or  at the company s option  as eurodollar loans as defined in the senior credit facility 
base rate loans shall bear interest at the base rate defined as the higher of i the applicable prime lending rate of nationsbank  na or ii the federal reserve reported certificate of deposit rate plus 
eurodollar loans shall bear interest at the eurodollar rate as defined in the senior credit facility  plus a margin based on leverage 
the company is required to pay the lenders under the senior credit facility a commitment fee  payable in arrears on a quarterly basis  on the average unused portion of the senior credit facility during the term of the facility 
the company is also required to pay an annual agency fee to the agent 
in addition  the company was also required to pay an arrangement fee for the account of each bank in accordance with the banks respective pro rata share of the senior credit facility 
the agent and the lenders will receive such other fees as have been separately agreed upon with the agent 
the senior credit facility requires the company to meet certain financial tests  including  without limitation  maximum levels of senior secured debt as a ratio of ebitda as defined in the senior credit facility  minimum interest and fixed charge ratios and maximum amount of capital expenditures 
the senior credit facility also contains certain covenants which  among other things  will limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  prepayments of other indebtedness including the notes  liens and encumbrances and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
in the first quarter of  the company gave notice to the administrative agent that lower than expected performance in the first quarter of would result in the company s inability to meet certain financial covenants contained in the senior credit facility 
on april   the company and the lenders agreed to the first amendment to credit agreement and consent and waiver the first amendment which waived compliance  for the fiscal quarter ending march   with the financial covenants set forth in the senior credit facility 
in addition  the first amendment waived any event of default related to two acquisitions made by the company in the first quarter of  and waived the requirement that the company deliver annual financial statements to the lenders within days of december   provided that such financial statements shall be delivered no later than april  the first amendment contained amendments that provided for the following 
amendment of the applicable percentages for eurodollar loans for the period between april  and june  at each pricing level to higher than those in the previous pricing grid 
prepayment of debt from receipt of dial around compensation accounts receivable related to the period november through october 
further limitations on permitted acquisitions as defined in the credit agreement through june  
during the period april  to june   required lenders consent for the making of loans or the issuance of letters of credit if the sum of revolving loans outstanding plus letter of credit obligations outstanding exceeds million 
the introduction of a new covenant to provide certain operating data to the lenders on a monthly basis 
increases in the maximum allowable ratio of funded debt to ebitda through the quarter ended june  
decreases in the minimum allowable interest coverage ratio through the quarter ended june  
decreases in the minimum allowable fixed charge coverage ratio through the quarter ended june  the company believes that it is probable that it will comply with the loan covenants for the next twelve months and  as such  has not classified the obligations under the senior credit facility as current liabilities 
the first amendment also places limits on capital expenditures and required the payment of an amendment fee equal to the product of each lender s commitment multiplied by 
the senior credit facility contains customary events of default  including without limitation  payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  cross defaults to certain other indebtedness  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  judgment defaults  failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the senior credit facility to be in full force and effect  and a change of control of the company 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and available borrowings under the senior credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s forseeable cash requirements  including capital expenditures through december  the company also believes that it will be able to fund any future acquisitions through a combination of cash generated from operations  additional borrowing and the issuance of shares of the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will continue to expand at its current rate or that additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
impact of inflation inflation is not a material factor affecting the company s business 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
seasonality the company s revenues from its payphone operating regions are affected by seasonal variations  geographic distribution of payphones and type of location 
because many of the company s payphones are located outdoors  weather patterns have differing effects on the company s results depending on the region of the country where the payphones are located 
most of the company s payphones in florida produce substantially higher call volume in the first and second quarters than at other times during the year  while the company s payphones throughout the midwestern and eastern united states produce their highest call volumes during the second and third quarters 
while the aggregate effect of the variations in different geographical regions tend to counteract the effect of one another  the company has historically experienced higher revenue and income in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
changes in the geographical distribution of its payphones may in the future result in different seasonal variations in the company s results 
year issue the company is working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the ability of the company s computerized information systems to accurately process information that may be date sensitive 
any of the company s programs that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year could result in errors or system failures 
the company utilizes a number of computer programs across its entire operation 
the company has assessed the impact of the year on both its computer programs and its computer systems 
as the company acquires other payphone assets  it will continue to assess the impact of the year on such acquired assets 
to date  the company has spent approximately million in assessing and addressing year issues and estimates that its total costs will not exceed million  which is approximately of the company s budgeted expenditures for information technology 
the company does not believe that these costs will have a material effect on its financial position 
the company is also in the process of addressing the potential impact of the year on its suppliers and other parties on whom it relies in providing payphone and operator services 
the company intends to complete this assessment by june  the failure of third parties on which the company relies to address their year issues in a timely manner could result in a material financial risk to the company 
through its assessment of the impact of year on both its computer programs and systems  the company believes that it has sufficient resources available to implement new and modified computer systems to address the impact of the year  and accordingly  has not to date identified any need for other contingency planning 
however  the company s continuing assessment of its assets and of third parties external to the company may reveal the need for contingency planning in the future 
the company plans to devote all resources required to resolve any significant year issues in a timely manner 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board recently issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position at fair value unless specific hedge criteria are met 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in adoption of this statement is not expected to significantly impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates 
the company s objective is to minimize the volatility in earnings and cash flow from these risks 
in connection with the provisions of its long term debt agreement and the company s overall interest rate objectives  the company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce its interest rate exposure to market risks from significant increases in interest rates 
the company s strategy is to purchase interest rate swaps  collars and caps from large financial institutions that in the aggregate maintain notional amounts exceeding of the company s outstanding long term debt balance to limit the impact of increases in interest rates on the company s variable rate long term debt 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   a ten percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
these effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates  however  ignore other effects the same movement may have arising from other variables  and actual results could differ from the sensitivity calculations of the company 
the company regularly assesses these variables  establishes policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations and does not anticipate any material losses generated by these risks
