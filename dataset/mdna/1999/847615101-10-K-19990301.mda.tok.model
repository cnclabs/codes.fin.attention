us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on the company includes the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean water act  and the safe drinking water act 
the company is also subject to the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on the company s operations 
in addition to these federal activities  various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations 
as part of its continuing environmental program  the company has been able to comply with such environmental regulations without any materially adverse effect on its business 
the company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
however  the company continuously monitors operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in the company s manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  the company passes increased costs on to its customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales increases reported in the accompanying financial statements  however  have substantially arisen from increased sales volume  not increases in selling prices 
impact of year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  prepare invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment and determined that it will have to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the company presently believes that with modifications and replacement of existing software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date  the company has fully completed its assessment of all material systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the completed assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems could be affected 
the assessment also indicated that software used in certain manufacturing equipment hereafter also referred to as operating equipment is also at risk 
if not resolved on a timely basis  these systems could hamper the company s ability to manufacture and ship product from which the company derives a significant portion of its revenues 
for its information technology exposures  to date  the company is complete on the remediation phase for all material systems and expects to complete software reprogramming and replacement no later than january after completing the reprogramming and replacement of software  the company s plans call for testing and implementing its information technology systems 
to date  the company has completed of its testing and has implemented of its remediated systems 
completion of the testing phase is expected by february  with all remediated systems fully implemented by march with respect to operating equipment  the company is complete in the remediation phase of the resolution process 
testing of this equipment is currently complete 
once testing is complete  the operating equipment will be ready for immediate use 
the company expects to complete its remediation efforts by january testing and implementation of affected equipment is expected to be completed by march the company has queried its important suppliers and vendors to assess their year readiness 
to date  the company is not aware of any problems that would materially impact results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that these suppliers and vendors will be year ready 
the inability of those parties to complete their year resolution process could materially impact the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test  and implement the software and operating equipment for year modifications 
management anticipates that its total year project costs will not be material 
the company s plans to complete year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
estimates on the status of completion and the expected completion dates are based on hours expended to date compared to total expected hours 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel training in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
other matters in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

or the introduction of the euro to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on february   the company announced the signing of a letter of intent to acquire substantially all of the assets of the signal conditioning products division of amp incorporated scpd 
under the proposed agreement  the company would purchase scpd s ceramic filter manufacturing technology and related product lines  as well as certain product lines related to capacitive film and emi gaskets 
scpd sales of these product offerings amounted to approximately million in the company has secured a commitment letter from its principal lending institution to substantially finance the transaction
