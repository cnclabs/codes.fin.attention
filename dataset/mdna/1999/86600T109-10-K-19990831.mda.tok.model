approximately of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of products on the television network 
the company s products include sports collectibles and sports related products  plush toys  movie memorabilia and other signed and autographed merchandise  electronic equipment  coins and currency  cutlery and knives  jewelry and gemstones

as of june   the company s programming was viewable during all or part of each day by approximately million individual cable households  of which approximately million cable households received the programming on essentially a full time basis or more hours per day and the remaining million cable households received it on a part time basis 
to measure performance in a manner that reflects both the growth of the company and the nature of its access to part time cable households  the company uses a cable household full time equivalent method to measure the reach of its programming which accounts for both the quantity and quality of time available to it 
to derive this full time equivalent cable household base fte cable household  the company has developed a methodology to assign a relative value of each hour of the day to its overall sales  which is based on sales in markets where the programming is carried on a full time basis 
each hour of the day has a value based on historical sales 
fte cable households have grown from  and million at june    and respectively  to million at june  the company believes that the change in the number of fte cable household provides a consistent measure of its growth and applies this methodology to all affiliates 
accordingly  the company uses the revenue per average fte cable household as a measure of pricing new affiliate contracts and estimating their anticipated revenue performance 
when the company enters a new market  it generally takes about three months to establish program awareness by the viewers

principal elements in the company s cost structure are a cost of goods sold  b transponder and cable costs and c salaries and wages 
the company s cost of goods sold is a direct result of both the product mix and its ability to negotiate favorable prices from its vendors 
transponder and cable costs include expenses related to carriage under affiliation and transponder agreements 
carriage costs have increased in recent periods and the company expects this trend will continue as it enters new markets and expands the number of households and viewable hours for its programming 
carriage costs have also increased because of general increases in the rates charged for carriage 
because it takes a period of time for a market s revenue potential to mature  the company expects to pay initial carriage cost in excess of its goal of approximately of revenues from the market 
if carriage cost does not decrease toward this goal as the market matures  management of the company will usually attempt to renegotiate the carriage contract  seek an opportunity to terminate the carriage contract or not renew it 
salaries and wages have increased with the company s increased revenues and the addition of staff to support its growth

on august   the federal communications commission fcc voted to make certain significant changes in the restrictions involving the multiple ownership of broadcast stations 
at that time  the fcc voted to liberalize the local ownership limits on television ownership and to relax the rules prohibiting cross ownership of radio and television stations in the same market 
under these new rules  a company can own two television stations in the same market so long as there are more than eight television stations in the market  and the two stations are not both among the top four stations in the market 
of the six television stations owned by the company  each is located in a market with more than eight television stations  and none of the company s stations are among the top four rated stations in their markets 
as a result  any owner of an existing television station in any of the company s markets  could acquire the company s station in that market 
the company believes that this rule change by the fcc makes the company s stations more valuable than when the stations were purchased 
on august   the company announced that it had retained yagemann advisors llc  banc of america securities llc and media venture partners to identify strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value  including the possible sale of some or all of the company s major market stations as well as the sale of a significant equity ownership interest to a strategic partner 
the company stated that no decision had been made as to whether or not to pursue any particular alternative  and there is a possibility that no transaction will result 
if the company were to sell one or more of its stations as a result of this opportunity  the company would seek to use a portion of the resulting proceeds to replace any lost carriage of the company s programming through the acquisition of other stations or by agreements with cable television operators 
a potential equity investment by a strategic partner could enhance or benefit the company s broadcast  internet and electronic retailing capabilities 
the indenture under which the notes are issued imposes restrictions on the ability of the company to sell its assets or to use the proceeds of such sales for general corporate purposes 
the company could use proceeds of such a sale to defease the notes in order to make the additional proceeds available for other purposes 
year computer systems  computer software  and equipment dependent on microprocessors may cease to function or work incorrectly when the year arrives 
the problem affects those systems and computer products which are programmed to use a two digit code for the year  and may read the code as rather than to prevent critical failures of important computers or products  this problem  sometimes referred to as the yk problem  must be identified and corrected 
systems and equipment that will not experience this problem are generally referred to as year compliant  or yk compliant 
shop at home intends to become year compliant through systems replacement and believes existing capital budgets are adequate for any remaining hardware and software replacements 
shop at home is supported by redundant ibm rs computers  each of which communicates directly with its year compliant backup disk system 
the aix operating system currently in use is yk compliant 
the relocation to nashville facilitated compliance efforts by requiring the replacement of key network equipment 
since the move  approximately of local area network application servers and computers have been upgraded to windows nt systems  and the company is currently testing the yk compliance patch to windows nt 
additionally  shop at home s telephone system  aspect software and computer server used in the company s call center have been upgraded and are compliant 
the company s telephone voice response system  the internet web server and a software program utilized by the human resources department are being remediated through the replacement of the telephone voice response system and the installation of the new oracle computer system 
a year committee has been established and part of its task is to review businesses outside of shop at home whose systems are electronically linked to the company 
shop at home has provided many of its vendors with yk compliant software  and management is not presently aware of any material problems in the year compliance plans of its major vendors and service providers 
shop at home is investigating material vendors and suppliers to identify any non compliance issues 
the company has incurred approximately million on new computer hardware and systems to date 
most of the primary computer systems are being replaced either as part of the yk compliance program or in order to build a system to support future growth 
the total cost of system replacements  including both hardware and software  is expected to be approximately million  in addition to prior expenditures 
to implement the computer conversion  shop at home entered into agreements with its vendors 
the computer system provided by the vendors will be yk compliant and will provide an integrated computer system for shop at home s business processes 
the enterprise wide system is expected to be installed and operational by the end of to date the company has substantially completed the review of its critical internal hardware and software systems  has identified those vendors which warrant further examination for potential problems and has mailed inquiries to those vendors as to their compliance 
the company has also identified and corrected internal problems and begun evaluation of the responses to questionnaires sent to suppliers  and has begun testing its internal systems and contingency planning 
the following is the timetable for shop at home s year compliance effort during the remainder of augustcomplete contingency planning 
begin contingency testing  continue the internal oracle implementation of new hardware and software 
septembercontinue contingency testing  complete software upgrades and testing on all network pc s 
octobercomplete all evaluation and testing  review all portions of yk documentation 
the worst case scenario for shop at home would be for critical vendors or service providers to have yk problems 
these critical vendors and suppliers include bank card processors  long distance telephone service providers and the full time satellite transponder provider 
although these vendors have advised the company that they are in compliance  contingency plans will include identifying alternative vendors and providers 
despite the concern among the general public with year problems  management does not anticipate major interruptions 
the development and testing of contingency plans should assure that no major interruptions occur 
management believes its yk program is adequate to detect compliance problems in advance  and that the necessary resources to remedy them are available 
the yk problem  however  has many aspects and potential consequences  some of which are not reasonably foreseeable 
therefore  there can be no assurance that unforeseen consequences will not occur
