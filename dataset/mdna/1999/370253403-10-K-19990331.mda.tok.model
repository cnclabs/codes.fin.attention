the company expects that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances of million as of december   together with additional financing received in the first quarter of  will be adequate to fund the company s operations through however  the company will continue to evaluate additional sources of capital

if adequate funds are not available to satisfy the company s short term or long term capital requirements  the company may be required to significantly limit its operations  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operation

year status 
like many companies and organizations  the company faces risks related to the inability of computer systems to accurately identify and process dates beyond the year the company is currently taking steps to ensure its year readiness by addressing these risks for all of its computer systems  including its internal systems and systems supplied to it by third parties 
these systems include those that are commonly thought of as information technology systems  such as billing  accounting and network systems 
in addition  these systems include those that are non information technology systems  such as building control systems  building safety systems and communications systems 
the company has assembled a year project team and engaged outside consultants to advise it on year issues 
the year project team has developed a plan to evaluate and to mitigate the risks related to year issues for i systems related to the company s portico virtual assistant service and ii all other systems 
the plan includes each of the following phases for both portico and other systems creation of an inventory of all potentially date sensitive systems  including third party systems  evaluation and or testing of all systems  remediation or replacement of systems which are not year ready  verification of corrected systems  development and implementation of configuration control procedures to assure that systems remain year ready once they have been determined to be year ready  and development and implementation of a contingency plan in the event that the company or its suppliers fail for any reason to attain year readiness 
the company s year plan has executive sponsorship  is regularly reviewed by senior management  and includes progress reports to the board of directors on a regular basis 
for all systems related to the portico service  the company has completed the inventory and has initiated evaluation and or testing of the systems identified 
the company believes that certain of these systems are year ready  and is now in the process of remediating or replacing systems which are not 
the company expects to begin verification of corrected portico systems during the second quarter of the company has completed the inventory for all other systems and is now in the process of evaluating and or testing such systems 
the company believes that certain of these systems are year ready 
the company expects to complete remediation or replacement of the systems which are not year ready during the second quarter and to begin verification of corrected systems by the end of the second quarter of the company expects to complete all phases of the year plan for systems related to portico and for all other of its systems by the end of the third quarter of  except that the contingency plan will be developed and implemented during the third and fourth quarters of in the process of evaluating its systems  the company has contacted certain of its key suppliers to determine whether their operations and the products and services they provide are year ready 
during the second quarter  the company will request written assurances of year readiness from all significant suppliers who have not otherwise provided sufficient written assurances 
based on its inquiries to date  the company believes that certain third party systems will require remediation or replacement 
if remediation or replacement is not practicable  the company will seek alternative suppliers whose products and services are year ready 
costs 
the company believes that the costs related to its year effort will not exceed  approximately of its actual and anticipated information technology operating budget for fiscal years and the company estimates that the total costs will include approximately  for external consultants and advisers  approximately  for replacement of systems which are not year ready and approximately  for the direct costs of internal employees working on the year project 
the company does not expect to incur any costs related to delay of its non year information technology efforts or to the acceleration of system upgrades or replacements 
the company has and will continue to fund its year effort from cash on hand 
as of december   the company had incurred approximately  in costs related to the execution of its year plan 
risks 
based on currently available information  the company does not believe that year issues will have a material adverse impact on its results of operations or financial condition 
however  the company may fail to identify all critical year problems  may not properly assess  remediate or test its systems  and may encounter unexpected delays or costs associated with its year effort 
in addition  the company has not completed its assessment of the year readiness of significant suppliers 
the company believes that products and services supplied by third parties present the greatest year risks to the company 
the company relies on third party suppliers for a significant number of systems related to its portico service  such as the calendar and contact software  the voice recognition software  the text to speech software  the billing system  and the network operations center equipment 
in addition  the company relies on third parties for key services  such as telecommunications  internet access and power 
in the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  one of the company s critical systems and or one of the critical systems supplied by a third party could prove to be noncompliant and fail 
such a failure could lead to interruptions in the company s operations and service offerings 
such interruptions could lead to lost sales  loss of relationships with partners and damage to the company s business reputation 
due to the large number of variables involved  the company cannot provide an estimate of the damages it may suffer if it or its suppliers are not year ready 
note the foregoing discussion of year issues shall be considered year readiness disclosure for purposes of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on debt obligations 
we do have a letter of credit denominated in japanese yen 
a subsequent fluctuation that strengthens the japanese yen would increase our commitment as of december   by approximately
