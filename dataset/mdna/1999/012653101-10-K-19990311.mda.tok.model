see note  operating segments and geographic area information of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item on page competition the company operates in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of other companies in each of its product lines 
some markets involve a significant number of competitors  while others involve only a few 
the competitors of the company are both larger and smaller in terms of resources and market share 
competition generally is based on product performance  reputation for quality  price and customer service and support 
the degree and nature of competition depends on the type of product involved 
in general  the company competes in all of its markets on the basis of the quality and price of its products as well as customer services by maintaining a broad range of products and by focusing resources on products in which the company has a competitive advantage 
the company endeavors to improve its reputation for quality products  competitive prices and excellent customer service and support 
competition in connection with all of the company s products requires continuing investments in research and development  product and process improvements and specialized customer services

the company also produces bromine in arkansas from its extensive brine reserves backed by an active leasing program 
the company has supply agreements with the dead sea bromine group of companies 
the contracts essentially cover the bromine requirements for the production of bromine fine chemicals in our thann  france facility and provide additional bromine if requested for the company s other bromine needs 
major customers due to the diversity of product lines in which the company competes  no major portion of the company s sales or earnings was generated by one customer nor is the company overly reliant on contracts with any one public  private or governmental entity 
several of the company s customers manufacture products for cyclical industries such as the agricultural  automotive  electronics and building and construction industries 
as a result  demand for the products of the company from customers in such industries also is cyclical 
in addition  the profitability of sales of certain of the company s products depends on the level of industry plant capacity utilization 
due to the diversity and size of the company s operations  there is little seasonal variation in revenues or earnings  except for certain agricultural products

polymer chemicals net sales were up million due to higher shipments in flame retardants and organometallics and catalysts  offset in part  by lower pricing and the effects of foreign exchange in europe and the asia pacific region 
net sales for amounted to million  down million from million in excluding the first two months net sales of the olefins business sold march   albemarle s net sales for would have shown an increase of million from due to higher shipments in polymer chemicals primarily organometallics  antioxidants and flame retardants  offset in part by the effects of a stronger us dollar on sales in europe and the asia pacific region 
fine chemicals net sales also were up over due primarily to higher shipments in agrichemicals and pharmachemicals 
operating costs and expenses cost of goods sold in decreased million from primarily due to improved plant utilizations  the impact of the company s cost reduction program  and lower shipments in certain products offset in part  by the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange transaction losses of million in versus foreign exchange transaction gains of million in  with the result that the gross profit margin increased to in from in overall  albemarle s raw material costs were lower in than reflecting softness in many of the commodity markets

outlook the performance of the company reflects high utilization of the company s plants  stock repurchases of more than million shares  diminished sales due to the impact of foreign exchange  the faltering asian economies and slow starts in the sales of new products 
cash flows from operations were up from going forward to  continuation of the high plant utilization depends upon demand for the company s products 
interest expense will be higher in  reflecting higher average debt outstanding  primarily related to the share repurchase program 
the company will continue to work on infrastructure costs through its cost control efforts 
we will continue to monitor the company s foreign exchange exposure  where possible  and  in some cases  utilize foreign exchange hedges when and where appropriate 
for the company s two operating segments  polymer chemicals and fine chemicals  we should see sales growth in  assuming pricing  currency and volume objectives can be achieved 
sales growth likely will be greater in fine chemicals than in polymer chemicals 
volume should grow if economic conditions remain relatively strong outside of asia and latin america 
new products accounted for about million in sales in the company s lower than expected sales from introduction of new products in was related to government regulations  market conditions and other issues 
new flame retardants  additional organometallics and catalysts and several new surface actives albemarle believes  could drive these programs forward in polymer chemicals as we enter  we are pleased with the growth of the customers we now supply in the company s flame retardant business area 
the strong increase in sales volume in took place in the face of pricing pressures that have more than reversed the price increases 
we have fought to maintain excellent relationships with customers and will continue to do so 
in third quarter  we expect to start up a new tetrabromobisphenol a plant in magnolia  resulting in some additional costs 
customers are receiving qualification quantities 
we expect to follow through on customer qualification of the company s new saytex hp flame retardant with significant sales forecasted in the company s sales growth forecast in flame retardants is in the high single digit  perhaps double digit sales increase in  assuming the economies in europe and the us continue to grow and we are successful in the company s sales and support efforts for existing products  while developing the company s new product opportunities 
in the company s organometallics and catalysts business  aluminum alkyls sales should be about even with in the metallocene single site catalysts business  albemarle serves the company s customers through production of the metallocene single site complexes  co catalysts  and supported catalyst systems 
the production of metallocene single site complexes and supported catalyst systems is conducted under strict secrecy agreements 
this business should grow strongly but from a small base  if polymer makers adopt these new catalysts in their processes 
polymer additives and intermediates sales are expected to be flat with the upside in ethacure curative  a polyurethane curative  offset by slack demand in some of the more established products being sold into a variety of polymer applications 
ethacure curative completed all the rigorous governmental requirements on november  fine chemicals we continue to pursue a pharmachemicals marketing strategy of building relationships with innovators in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company s research and development strategy is based on strong technical competencies in several important chemistries 
the company s manufacturing strategy is aimed at filling the company s multi purpose plant facility with other products  such as propofol and its intermediates 
we continue to be very active on the naproxen qualification front for international customers  but the market growth is not as great as we expected  and a significant amount of excess manufacturing capacity is available 
globalization of the pharmachemicals business is another opportunity we will continue to pursue 
each of these issues will have the potential to impact the company s business  and could affect the company s projections for in pharmachemicals  where we see single digit increases in sales 
for in agrichemicals  we expect to achieve high single digit increases in sales  however  research and development r d spending and other costs may bring operating profit to or a little below levels in this mature business 
the company s focus for r d continues to be on niche fine chemicals 
we continue to explore methods of increasing business outside north america 
methyl bromide sales will be restricted by government regulations to of production in  going to in and in  under current us and international regulations 
albemarle intends to continue sales of this product for soil fumigant purposes until sales are suspended january  bromine and derivatives growth in will be dependent upon the recovery of oil drilling  the continued substitution of bromine for chlorine in many applications and the integration of the teesport  united kingdom operation the company acquired on october  double digit sales and operating profit growth may be possible for this portion of the fine chemicals segment  dependent upon these market factors 
additional cost reductions in manufacturing and continuing favorable chlorine and other raw material prices are necessary to support this growth  however  several of these factors are not under the company s control 
as we begin  the surface actives biocides business is beginning to make intermediate shipments to new customers and has more than product registrations pending with government authorities 
currently  we believe we can grow sales in double digits  and could do the same in operating profits with positive contributions from the new teesport facility s products developed for this business area  and the approvals of product registrations in the united states 
other key issues in this business going into include competitive pressures in builders for detergents and the short term startup costs associated with bringing new products on line 
potassium and chlorine chemicals results will depend on the regaining of strength in the asian economy and a favorable caustic chlorine balance in europe 
in summary  the company s two business segments  polymer chemicals and fine chemicals  should deliver high single digit or low double digit sales growth in with the current plan  assuming pricing  currency and volume objectives can be achieved and the economic conditions remain relatively strong outside of asia and latin america 
some of the information presented in this annual report form k constitutes forward looking comments within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although the company believes its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from its expectations due to a number of factors including  without limitation  the timing of orders received from customers  the gain or loss of significant customers  competition from other manufacturers  changes in the demand for the company s products  increases in the cost of the product  changes in the markets in general  fluctuations in foreign currencies and significant changes in new product introduction resulting in increases in capital project requests and approvals leading to additional capital spending 
financial condition and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  which represents a decrease of million from million at year end cash provided from operating activities was million  which together with million of proceeds from borrowings and existing cash and cash equivalents of million were used to cover operating activities in  including a working capital increase mainly reflecting higher inventories  capital expenditures  payment of quarterly dividends to common shareholders  purchase of  shares of common stock for million  the acquisition of the teesport  united kingdom facility and repayment of a portion of long term debt 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  which represented an increase of million from million at year end cash provided from operating activities was million  which together with million of proceeds from borrowings were used to cover operating activities in  including a working capital increase mainly reflecting higher accounts receivable and inventories and a decrease in accounts payable  capital expenditures  payment of quarterly dividends to common shareholders  purchase of  shares of common stock for million and repayment of a portion of long term debt  with the balance added to cash and cash equivalents 
the company anticipates that cash provided from operating activities in the future will be sufficient to cover its operating expenses  debt service obligations  dividend payments to common shareholders and to fund its capital expenditures 
the noncurrent portion of the company s long term debt amounted to million at december   compared to million at the end of the company s total long term debt  including the current portion  as a percentage of total capitalization at december   was approximately 
see note  long term debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages and for details of the company s long term borrowings 
the company  at december   had the flexibility to borrow up to a total of million million outstanding at december  under its competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants typical for a credit agreement of its size and nature  including financial covenants requiring the company to maintain consolidated indebtedness as defined of not more than of the sum of the company s consolidated shareholders equity as defined and consolidated indebtedness 
the amount and timing of any borrowings will depend on the company s specific cash requirements 
the company s foreign currency translation adjustments  net of related deferred taxes  at december   increased from december   primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
capital expenditures in of million were lower than the level of million 
the company s capital spending program is expected to be in the million range over the next few years 
this increase is expected to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales 
capital spending for environmental and safety projects is expected to be about the same over the next few years 
future capital spending is expected to be financed primarily with cash provided from operating activities  with the balance  if necessary  provided by additional long term debt 
the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions of facilities and or businesses  particularly in areas where our know how adds value 
market risk management in the normal course of operations  the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of its business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and the company s ongoing manufacturing and funding activities 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
the company has established policies  procedures and internal processes governing its management of uncertain market conditions  and uses both operational and financial market actions in its risk management activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company only enters into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments 
the company does not hedge its exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the company covers certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 
the primary currencies for which the company has foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  the company has increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize their impact on earnings of future periods 
the company s financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represent a net liability position of 
million at december  the company conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of its foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of 
million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of 
million in the fair value of foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to the best of the company s knowledge  it is currently complying with and expects to continue to comply in all material respects with existing environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
such compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or the competitive position of albemarle 
among other environmental requirements  the company is subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which the company may be designated as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  the company s participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled by the company or its predecessor company 
in de minimis prp matters  the company s policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling the company to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  the company s records indicate that unresolved exposures should be immaterial 
the company accrues and expenses its proportionate share of prp costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 as clarified by american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  the company is able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 
the company s environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense  which are not considered to be normal operating costs were approximately million in versus approximately million in and million in  excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december   totaled approximately million 
there is a reasonable possibility that future remediation costs in excess of amounts already recorded could be up to million before income taxes 
however  the company believes that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or annual results of operations  but could have a material adverse impact in a particular quarterly reporting period 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects for the company  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for each of the next few years  capital expenditures for these types of projects are likely to be in the same range as the level 
management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary 
year update general albemarle s company wide year project project generally is proceeding on schedule 
the project is addressing the ability of computer programs and embedded computer chips to distinguish between the year and the year in  the company began significant re engineering of its business processes across the company including improved access to business information through common  integrated computing systems 
as a result  albemarle replaced its business systems with systems from sap america  inc  oracle corporation  peoplesoft and lotus which are designed to be year compliant 
the company became fully operational on these systems in project the company has a global project team  with certain location specific sub teams 
the project includes three major areas corporate systems  local hardware and software systems  and third party suppliers of goods and services 
the general phases of the project are inventorying date aware items  determining criticality and assigning priorities to identified items  assessing the year compliance of items determined to be material to the company  repairing  replacing or identifying workarounds for material items that are determined not to be year compliant  testing material items  identifying critical third parties  and designing contingency plans 
material items are those believed by the company to have a risk involving the safety of individuals  or that may cause damage to property or the environment  or substantially affect revenues 
at december   the inventory  priority assessment and compliance assessment phases of each area of the project were essentially complete 
corporate systems on schedule at december  include hardware and systems software  networks and telecommunications 
all corporate systems activities are expected to be completed by mid local hardware and software systems include process control and instrumentation systems  laboratory data systems and building systems 
operational improvements already underway address some of the year concerns 
some manufacturer replacements or upgrades are behind schedule 
the company  however  estimates necessary replacements  upgrades  or work arounds should be completed by mid the third party suppliers phase includes the process of identifying and prioritizing critical suppliers of goods and services and identifying their plans and progress 
the company recently has completed the identification phase and has begun evaluations of its most critical suppliers 
these evaluations will be followed by the development of contingency plans as necessary 
this project phase is scheduled for completion by mid  with monitoring planned through the remainder of and early costs the total cost associated with required modifications to become year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position or operations 
the estimated total cost of the project is approximately million of which approximately half is or will be expensed and half is or will be capital items 
the estimate includes allowances for some items for which a fix or work around is still being determined 
the estimate does not include albemarle s potential share of year costs that may be incurred by small joint ventures in which the company participates or entities in which the company holds a minority interest 
the total amount expended on the project through december   was approximately million 
internal direct costs compensation and benefits are estimated for the project and included above  but are not separately tracked 
risks since the company s products are not date aware  albemarle s year issues revolve around its suppliers ability to supply  its ability to produce  its business processes functioning properly  and its customers ability to purchase 
contingency plans will be developed for the most critical third party suppliers of goods and services 
for example  these plans may include inventory increases of raw materials and finished products and or changes in the mix of suppliers for certain goods or services 
contingency plans for manufacturing and other business processes will include increased sensitivity at the actual changeover from december  to january  and alternative methods  including manual processing  for business information processes 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of certain normal business activities or operations  which could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year problems will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the project is expected to reduce significantly the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its material third party suppliers 
the company believes with the previously accomplished implementation of global business systems and completion of the project as scheduled  the probability of material interruptions of normal operations should be reduced significantly 
readers are cautioned that to the extent legally permissible  this statement should be considered a year readiness disclosure pursuant to the year information and readiness disclosure act and that forward looking statements contained in the year update should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures regarding the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of included on page new accounting pronouncements the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  which is effective for financial statements for all fiscal quarters beginning after june  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company will adopt sfas no 
in at the time of adoption  this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company
