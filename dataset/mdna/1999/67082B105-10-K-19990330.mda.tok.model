for the years ended december    and  approximately   and of the company s revenues  respectively  were derived from fixed price contracts 
fixed price contracts as a percentage of total company revenue declined in primarily due to the acquisition in july of oao services  inc  which has primarily time and materials contracts 
the fixed price contracts range from three to ten years in length and are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
the company s fixed price contracts generally require the company to meet certain pre established levels of service  while achieving certain operating or managerial efficiencies during the course of the engagements 
profitability is generally lower during the early term of the these engagements as the company invests in assuring a smooth start up and in attaining certain service levels prior to the implementation of productivity improvements 
upon completion of the initial performance phase  the company initiates activities to increase profitability through improved management practices and the establishment of new technical and operational methodologies 
staff augmentation services are a part of the company s service offerings to its strategic customers 
these services  provided on a time and materials basis  are regularly utilized within engagements to meet short or indefinite term requirements  to deliver personnel who augment the client s staffing or to respond to requirements that cannot be sufficiently defined to permit fixed prices 
there are also instances where an engagement has started on a time and materials basis and evolved to a fixed price basis as the requirements became sufficiently defined 
erp services are generally provided on a time and materials contractual basis 
the company  through its erp service line  provides entire life cycle services for organizations 
these services range from initial business process modeling and development  through system installation and implementation 
the company also provides a full suite of continuous support services to help maintain and upgrade these complex  mission critical systems 
the erp service line is dedicated to implementing and supporting systems from sap ag one of the world s leaders in erp solutions 
the company focuses its efforts on public sector customers  as well as middle market commercial customers 
in support of these efforts  the company has established strategic relationships with both sap and microsoft 
as a microsoft certified solutions provider mcsp  the company has launched a program to train and deploy technical consultants who are technically certified by sap  as well as being microsoft certified system engineers mcse 
this will enable the company to provide a combination of highly technical skills 
the company provides healthcare it solutions services under software license agreements with end users 
the agreements include product development  customer service  installation services  training and ongoing support 
in addition  other services may be provided  such as total project management  hardware planning and implementation  and custom programming 
mc is currently installed at over managed care organizations across the nation 
the company has experienced substantial growth since its inception  with revenues increasing to million in  from million in engagements which involve new services to existing customers or services to new customers may result in lower margins during the early term of the engagement 
the company has historically experienced margin improvements over the course of its engagements 
in addition  operating results can be affected by the level of the company s investments in international and other business development activities 
the company believes that its business is not seasonal 
quarterly results can be affected by the company s level of investment in the expansion and development of new service lines  the commencement of new contracts and engagements  the loss of strategic or end user customers  the timing of personnel cost increases and the portion of revenues derived from new client engagements 
the company s relationship with its first strategic customer  ibm  has continued to expand in terms of revenues  the range of services provided  the number of engagements and the number of ibm business units which have engaged the company s services 
revenues from ibm have increased on a percentage basis of the company s total revenues  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  and declined on a percentage basis from for the year ended december  the percentage has increased for the year ended december  due primarily to the increase in ibm revenues resulting from the acquisition of oao services  inc ibm is oao services primary customer 
the declining revenue percentage trend between and is primarily attributable to the company s expanding relationship with compaq  which became a primary customer in the company is currently a major delivery partner of compaq for outsourcing engagements across canada  and its relationship with compaq has expanded into other geographic areas 
revenues from compaq accounted for   and of the company s total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss of ibm or compaq as a strategic customer or a decrease in the revenue derived from the company s relationships with either ibm or compaq could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that either strategic customer will continue to engage the company s services at historical levels  if at all 
the termination or non renewal of a strategic customer s contract by an end user customer could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
while the it services industry has generally experienced labor shortages and wage inflation in excess of most other industries  the company s engagements have not been materially affected  primarily due to the company s practice of retaining the majority of the outsourced personnel 
the company prices its services under these engagements on the basis of the historical cost of the outsourced function  managerial experience and its assessment of evolving technical factors 
the company also enters into staffing services engagements requiring high demand it specialists for terms ranging up to months  usually on a time and materials basis 
the company is subject to the same general labor pressures inherent in the it services industry when performing these engagements  which are primarily related to the company s dsm and systems integration services 
the company is dependent upon its ability to attract  hire and retain personnel who possess the technical skills and experience necessary to meet the service requirements of its clients 
in pricing its services under shorter term engagements  the company evaluates the existing labor market for it specialists and the expected duration of the engagement 
the company often places its employees in the workplace of both its strategic and end user customers 
the company is therefore exposed to potential liability with respect to actions taken by its employees  such as damages caused by employee errors  misuse of client proprietary information or theft of client property 
due to the nature of the company s potential liability with respect to any such actions  there can be no assurance that any insurance maintained by the company will be adequate to cover any such liability

as a percentage of revenue  direct costs increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this percentage increase is primarily due to the higher proportion of revenues from new engagements and new services in compared to in entering new engagements  the company may accept short term contracts that do not include the economies of scale  leverage or short term opportunities for productivity improvements that are available in more mature or longer term engagements 
the company believes that these initial contracts are important in penetrating new markets and in establishing the degree of customer confidence required to secure additional business 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  these expenses decreased to from  which the company generally attributes to increased economies of scale from higher revenues

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of december   and million as of december  cash flows used in operations were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the use of cash in operations for the year ended december   was primarily the result of the increase in income tax receivable  as well as decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable 
the cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the acquisitions of oao services and dhr technologies  inc the company s business is not capital intensive  and expenditures in any given year are ordinarily not significant 
the company primarily funded its uses of cash from operations and proceeds received from its initial public offering in capital expenditures in included capital expenditures associated with the development of an operational  administrative and financial information system 
the company currently has a million revolving credit agreement the agreement with a commercial bank 
advances under the agreement are limited to of certain eligible accounts receivable of the company

the company is required to maintain certain financial and other covenants under the agreement with which it was not in compliance as of december  however  the company has obtained waivers and the bank has agreed to new terms  including new covenants  subject to formal documentation between the bank and the company 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the agreement 
the company currently anticipates that its existing cash balances as well as cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its operating cash needs for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that additional bank credit would be available to fund such operating and capital requirements if the company s cash needs expand more rapidly than expected 
in addition  the company could consider seeking additional public or private debt or equity financing to fund future growth opportunities

impact of the year issue the company recognizes the need to ensure that its operations will not be adversely impacted by yk failures 
the company has recognized the need to ensure that its operations will not be adversely impacted by the risk of potential disruption from the year yk problem 
this problem is a result of computer programs having been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any it systems that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations and system failures 
the problem also extends to many non it systems  that is  operating and control systems that rely on embedded chip systems 
in addition  like every other business enterprise  the company is at risk from yk failures on the part of its major business counterparts  including third party vendors  as well as potential failures in public and private infrastructure services  including electricity  water  gas  transportation and communications 
system failures resulting from the yk problem could adversely affect operations and financial results in all of the company s business segments 
failures may affect important operations as billing and collection and payroll operations  as well as other routine business operations 
accordingly  in january of  the company initiated a program to determine its state of readiness for its it and non it systems and to identify and properly address issues associated with the yk issue 
the company has made substantial progress in assessing how it will be impacted by the issue 
in june of  a company wide initiative began to assess third party vendor state of readiness 
the company is in the process of obtaining compliance certificates from its third party vendors  however  the company is unable to definitively determine that all third party vendors will reach yk ready status 
as of december   the company has surveyed all of its business and critical systems  and plans for replacement of non compliant equipment and software have been put in place 
the cost of the replacement systems is estimated at approximately  scheduled to be incurred in the first quarter of in the normal course of business 
the company does not have a written contingency plan in place addressing the effect  if any  should any of its third party vendors fail to deliver yk compliance 
any additional need for contingency plans or back up systems will be addressed and determined during the first half of the activities involved in the company s yk program necessarily involve estimates and projections  as described above  of activities and resources that will be required in the future 
these estimates and projections may be revised as work progresses on this program 
if any of the significant third party vendors are not yk compliant and or the company fails to identify or replace non compliant equipment or software and noncompliance causes a material disruption to the business of the company  the company s revenues and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that yk will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
based upon its efforts to date  the company believes that the vast majority of both its it and its non it systems  including all critical and important systems  will remain up and running after january  accordingly  the company does not currently anticipate that internal systems failures will result in any material adverse effect to its operations or financial condition 
during  the company will continue and expand its efforts to ensure that major third party vendors and providers of infrastructure services  such as utilities and communications services  will also be prepared for the year the company is devoloping contingency plans to address any failures on their part to become yk compliant 
at this time  the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario involves potential disruptions in areas in which the company s operations must rely on such third parties whose systems may not work properly after january  while such failures could affect important operations of the company and its subsidiaries  either directly or indirectly  in a significant manner  the company cannot at present estimate either the likelihood or the potential cost of such failures 
the nature and focus of the company s efforts to address the year problem may be revised periodically as new issues are identified 
in addition  it is important to note that the description of the company s efforts necessarily involves estimates and projections with respect to activities required in the future 
these estimates and projections are subject to change as work continues  and such changes may be substantial 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company conducts business in foreign countries  primarily canada 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the company s results of operations for the year ended december  the company believes its foreign currency risk is related primarily to the difference between amounts the company receives and disburses in canada in us dollars from us dollar denominated contracts 
the company does not expect the amount of foreign currency risk to be material in the future 
to date  the company has not entered into any significant foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
