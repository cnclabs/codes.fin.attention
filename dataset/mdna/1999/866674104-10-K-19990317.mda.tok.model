year update the year yk issue concerns the inability of computerized information systems and non information systems to accurately calculate  store or use a date after this could result in computer system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
in  the company implemented a corporate wide yk program to minimize any such disruption caused by the failures of its own internal systems or those of its business supply chain 
in the first phase of the project  the company reviewed its inventory of computer hardware and software  and other devices with embedded microprocessors 
the company also discussed its software applications and internal operational programs with its current information systems vendors 
finally  in this assessment phase  key members of the business supply chain were contacted and interviewed regarding their awareness of the yk problem and the status of their own yk project 
the first phase was completed on schedule during and all key members of the company s business supply chain reported that they were aware of the yk problem and were in the process of readying for the yk issue 
in the second phase of the project  all systems found to be yk non compliant were upgraded  fixed  replaced and tested 
the second phase was also completed on schedule in december the company believes that as a result of this implementation testing phase  its applications and programs will properly recognize calendar dates beginning in the year the company plans to continue monitoring yk communications from its software vendors and anticipates that some vendors will recommend further patches upgrades and testing 
in the third and final phase of the yk program  the company is surveying its material third party service providers  such as its banks  payroll processor  stock transfer agent and telecommunications provider 
the purpose of the survey is to follow up on the status of their yk compliance efforts and assess what effect their possible non compliance might have on the company 
in addition  the company is discussing with its material vendors the possibility of any interface difficulties and or electrical or mechanical problems relating to yk which may affect properties owned or operated by the company 
the company plans to complete its assessment of yk compliance by such parties by april  until such time  the company cannot estimate any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of vendors or third party service providers to address their yk issues  however  to date  no significant yk related conditions have been identified 
expenditures for assessing the company s yk issues have not been material because the evaluation has been conducted by its own personnel or by its vendors in connection with their servicing operations 
the company has contracted a consultant for  to assess the methodology of its yk program 
the company plans to remedy any exceptions found during this review process and deemed as material by the company by june  based on its current information  the company believes that the risk posed by any foreseeable yk related problem with its internal systems and the systems at its properties including both information and non information systems or with its vendors is minimal 
yk related problems with the company s software applications and internal operational programs or with the electrical or mechanical systems at its properties are unlikely to cause more than minor disruptions in the company s operations 
the company believes that the risk posed by yk related problems for certain third party service providers is marginally greater  though  based on its current information  the company does not believe any such problems would have a material effect on its operations 
any yk related problems at these third party service providers could delay the processing of financial transactions or payroll and could disrupt the company s internal and external communications 
while the company believes that it will be yk capable by december   there can be no assurance that the company has been or will be successful in identifying and assessing yk issues  or that  to the extent identified  the company s efforts to resolve such issues will be effective such that yk issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operation
