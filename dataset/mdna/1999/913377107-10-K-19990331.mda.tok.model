liquidity and capital resources the company s need for capital has historically been to maintain or increase the surplus of its insurance subsidiaries and to support the company as an insurance holding company  including the maintenance of its status as a public company 
in addition  the company requires capital to fund its anticipated growth through acquisitions of other companies and blocks of insurance business 
the company the company requires cash to pay the operating expenses necessary to support its status as an insurance holding company which under applicable insurance department regulations must bear its own expenses  and to meet the cost involved in being a publicly owned company 
in addition  it requires cash to meet universal s obligations under the debentures outstanding with american progressive and to meet the quarterly amortization of the bank loan entered into on december   as amended on september  on december  the company issued  shares of series d preferred stock for million 
see private placement financing series d preferred stock 
the proceeds were used to make a million capital contribution to american pioneer on december  and for working capital  in december  the company entered into an agreement with chase manhattan bank for a million five year  secured term loan and during the nine months ended september   the company made principal payments totaling million 
the loan agreement called for interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points 
however  in order for it hedge the interest rate risk on this loan agreement  the company entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement  the swap agreement with chase securities corp  effective january  and locked in a fixed interest rate of 
during the nine months ended september   the company paid million in interest for the period december  to september  on september   the company executed the first amendment to its credit agreement with chase manhattan bank  which amendment refinanced the current loan agreement with the bank 
under the amendment  the company executed a new million five year secured term loan 
the principle amount outstanding on the prior loan was million and was paid off with the proceeds of the new loan 
the new loan agreement calls for interest at the libor plus basis points 
the company s three year interest rate swap agreement with the bank remains in effect on the original million loan  which locked in a fixed interest rate on the refinanced loan of 
the effect of this swap agreement was to increase interest expense by  in in the fourth quarter  the company paid million in principal and million in interest under the amended loan agreement 
the loan remains to be secured by a first priority interest in all the assets of worldnet services corp 
and quincy corp  a pledge of of the outstanding common shares of american progressive and of the shares of quincy coverage corp 
the company believes that the cash flow from worldnet will be able to sufficiently service the installment payments required by the loan agreement 
in connection with the unstacking agreement see business unstacking  universal has million in debentures outstanding to its american progressive subsidiary 
the debentures pay interest quarterly at and are due between september and may management believes that the current cash position and expected cash flows of the non insurance companies and the availability of dividends from american pioneer can support the obligations of universal noted above for the foreseeable future 
although  there can be no assurance as to the expected future cash flows or to the availability of dividends from american pioneer 
insurance subsidiaries american progressive  american pioneer and american exchange are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital and surplus as determined by statutory accounting 
the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements of american progressive  american pioneer and american exchange as of december  for the maintenance of authority to do business were million  million and million  respectively 
however  in these states substantially more than such minimum amounts are needed to meet statutory and administrative requirements of adequate capital and surplus to support the current level of the insurance subsidiaries operations 
at december  the adjusted statutory capital and surplus  including asset valuation reserve  of american progressive  american pioneer and american exchange was million  million and million  respectively 
during  the company made capital contributions totaling million to american pioneer 
these amounts were generated by the proceeds of the first amendment to the company s credit agreement and from the proceeds of the series d preferred stock issuance 
the capital contributions were made to support the growth in new business production at american pioneer 
the naic risk based capital rbc rules have been adopted by new york  florida and texas 
see regulation risk based capital requirements 
the rbc rules provide for various actions when the ratio of a company s total adjusted surplus to its rbc falls below 
at december   american progressive  american pioneer and american exchange had rbc ratios of approximately  and  of the authorized control level  respectively 
liquidity for the life insurance subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  and fund investment commitments 
sources of liquidity include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments and deposits and the sale of liquid investments 
these sources of liquidity for the insurance subsidiaries significantly exceed scheduled uses 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  benefits under accident health policies and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of the company s in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  the company imposes penalties for early surrenders 
at december  the company held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of its in force life insurance and annuities by more than million 
the insurance companies  in management s view  have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity in recent years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if the company were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
the company manages the asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
the company seeks to invest in assets that have duration and interest rate characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
as a result of the decrease in economic interest rates  the net yield on the company s cash and invested assets decreased from in to in a significant portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by management based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
the company s investment policy is to balance the portfolio between long term and short term investments so as to continue to achieve investment returns consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity adequate to meet payment of policy benefits and claims 
the company invests in assets permitted under the insurance laws of the various states in which it operates 
such laws generally prescribe the nature  quality of and limitations on various types of investments that may be made 
the company currently engages the services of an investment advisor  asset allocation and management company  an affiliate of aam  to manage the company s fixed maturity portfolio  under the direction of the management of the insurance subsidiaries and in accordance with guidelines adopted by their respective boards of directors 
the company s policy is not to invest in derivative programs or other hybrid securities  except for gnma s  fnma s and investment grade corporate collateralized mortgage obligations 
it invests primarily in fixed maturity securities of the us government and its agencies and in corporate fixed maturity securities with investment grade ratings of baa moody s  bbb standard poor s or higher 
however  the company does own some investments that are rated bb or below together and of total fixed maturities as of both december  and  respectively 
as of december  all securities were current in the payment of principal and interest 
at december   the insurance subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as well as fixed maturity and equity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of million 
the fair values of these liquid holdings totaled more than million 
federal income taxation of the company the company files a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes  in which american pioneer and american exchange are not currently permitted to be included 
at december  the company exclusive of american pioneer and american exchange had a net operating tax loss carry forwards of approximately million which expire in the years to at december  the company also had alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million which can be used indefinitely 
american pioneer and american exchange file a separate consolidated federal income tax return 
at december  american pioneer and american exchange had net operating tax loss carry forwards  most of them incurred prior to their acquisition by the company  of approximately million which expire in the years to as a result of changes in ownership of american pioneer in may  use of most of the loss carry forwards of american pioneer are subject to annual limitations 
at december  and  the company has established valuation allowances of  with respect to these net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets 
the company determines a valuation allowance based upon an analysis of projected taxable income and through its ability to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the tax planning strategies include the company s recent reorganization and use of its administration company worldnet to generate taxable income 
these changes resulted in the company increasing taxable income in the non life companies by million and million in and  respectively 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the recorded net deferred tax assets 
the insurance subsidiaries are taxed as life insurance companies as provided in the tax code 
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of amended the tax code to require a portion of the expenses incurred in selling insurance products to be capitalized and amortized over a period of years  as opposed to an immediate deduction in the year incurred 
instead of measuring actual selling expenses  the amount capitalized for tax purposes is based on a percentage of premiums 
in general  the capitalized amounts are subject to amortization over a ten year period 
since this change only affects the timing of the deductions  it does not  assuming stability of rates  affect the provisions for taxes reflected in the company s financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  by deferring deductions  the change does have the effect of increasing the current tax expense  thereby reducing statutory surplus 
because of the insurance subsidiaries net operating loss carry forwards  there was no material increase in the company s current income tax provision for the three years ended december  due to this provision 
the clinton administration has made two tax proposals relating to the insurance industry that may have an impact on the company 
one proposal is to require recapture of untaxed profits on policyholder surplus accounts 
between and  stock life insurance companies deferred tax on a portion of their profits 
these untaxed profits were added to a policyholders surplus account psa 
in  congress precluded life insurance companies from continuing to defer taxes on any future profits 
the clinton administration argues that there is no continuing justification for permitting stock life companies to defer tax on profits that were earned between and accordingly  the stock life companies would be required to include in their gross income over a ten years their psa balances 
american pioneer has million of untaxed profits in its psa  while american progressive and american exchange have none 
a second proposal the clinton administration has made modifies the rules for capitalizing policy acquisition costs of life insurance companies on the grounds that life insurance companies generally only capitalize a fraction of their actual policy acquisition costs 
the proposed modifications to capitalization percentages apply only to group or individual term life insurance  non pension annuity contracts  cash value life insurance  credit life insurance and credit health insurance and are higher than the current capitalization percentages 
for the tax year  the company had million of premium receipts subject to proposed modifications to capitalization percentages 
the company can not predict whether or not these proposals will pass or pass in some modified form and  therefore  can not predict the impact caused by these proposed tax changes 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company s plan to resolve the year issue involves the following phases the assessment phase  which determines the impact of the year issue  the remediation phase  which is the updating or modifying of affected systems  the testing phase  which determines the effectiveness of the remediation phase  the implementation phase  which applies all proven systems to the operating environment and the contingency planning phase  which develops plans in the event that the year issue was not appropriately addressed 
the company has completed its assessment of the systems that could be significantly affected by the year issue 
the completed assessment indicated that the company s main policy administration system utilizes programs that were written using four digit codes to define the applicable year 
this main policy administration system was tested to determine the system s ability to operate after january  test results indicated that the system should continue to process transactions without disruption 
some of the company s computer programs used to process portions of the company s business outside of the main policy administration system were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year and therefore have to be modified or replaced 
as a result  the company began a conversion process to bring all of the company s products onto its main policy administration system 
all of the company s products were placed on this system by january  in addition to its policy administration system  the company performed assessments of other processing systems and determined that a claims paying system for a small block of business was not year compliant 
the company obtained the vendor upgrade for this system 
it is anticipated that the installation  testing and implementation of this upgrade will be completed by march  the company recently acquired blocks of business the first national and dallas general blocks and american exchange 
in connection with those acquisitions  the company has converted all of the acquired businesses into the year compliant systems currently in place 
in addition to resolving the internal year issue  the company is working with all external organizations  business partners and vendors to assess year issues associated with the exchange of electronic data 
the company is in the process of testing the interfaces with these business partners 
the company has also begun the process of obtaining year readiness statements from all its external business partners to determine the extent to which the company might be vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and will not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company estimates that its plan to resolve the year issue will be completed by june   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems  and that the year issue should not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if the company s plan is not successfully implemented  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan includes the development of contingency plans for any significant risks that might result from the year issue 
as discussed above  the company is not presently aware of any specific significant business risk that it believes it is exposed to regarding the year issue 
therefore  the company has not developed a contingency plan for the year issue 
the company will continue to monitor and assess risks for which contingency plans will be required 
a possible worst case scenario  although this is not considered likely  would occur if the federal government and its vendors were unable to continue to process medicare supplement claims electronically 
in the event that this would occur  the company s current procedure of obtaining medicare claim data through an electronic interface would not occur and the company would have to revert to manually entering this data into the claims paying system 
this would result in the company hiring approximately additional employees to handle the increase in this data entry function 
the company considers the clerical marketplace in each of its primary office locations pensacola  orlando  miami and rye brooke to be able to handle this situation in a satisfactory manner 
currently  the company expects the year project costs to be limited to the allocation of its data processing department resources  and significant external expenses are not expected 
accordingly  no specific budget for such costs has been allocated 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
effects of accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  because of universal s minimal use of derivatives  management does not anticipate that the adoption of the new statement will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position of the company 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information statement  effective for years beginning after december   which statement was adopted by the company 
statement requires that a public company report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments pursuant to criteria that differ from current accounting practice 
operating segments  as defined  are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision makers in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the financial information reported includes segment profit and loss  certain revenue and expense items and segment assets and reconciliations to corresponding amounts in the general purpose financial statements 
statement also requires information about revenues from products or services  countries where the company has operations or assets  and major customers 
the adoption of statement did not affect results of operations or financial position 
as of january   the company adopted statement  reporting comprehensive income 
statement establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components  however  the adoption of this statement had no impact on universal s net income or shareholders equity 
statement requires unrealized gains or losses on universal s available for sale securities  which prior to adoption were reported separately in shareholders equity  to be included in other comprehensive income 
prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the requirements of statement item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk relates  broadly  to changes in the value of financial instruments that arise from adverse movements in interest rates  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
the company is exposed principally to changes in interest rates that affect the market prices of its fixed income securities 
interest rate risk the company could experience economic losses if it was required to liquidate fixed income securities during periods of rising and or volatile interest rates 
however  the company attempts to mitigate its exposure to adverse interest rate movements through a combination of active portfolio management and by staggering the maturities of its fixed income investments to assure sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations and to address reinvestment risk considerations 
the company s insurance liabilities are generally long tailed in nature  which generally permits ample time to prepare for their settlement 
to date  the company has not utilized various financial risk management tools on its investment securities  such as interest rate swaps  forwards  futures and options to modify it exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  the company may consider them in the future 
the company is aware that certain classes of mortgage backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that in periods of declining interest rates  individuals may refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of the lower rates then available 
the company monitors investment portfolio mix to mitigate this risk 
sensitivity analysis the company regularly conducts various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rate on it financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect management s assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the accompanying analyses should  in no manner  be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather  be treated as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on the company s financial results 
the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk assumes an instantaneous shift in a parallel fashion across the yield curve  with scenarios of interest rates increasing and decreasing and basis points from their levels at december   and with all other variables held constant 
a and basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a pre tax decrease in the market value of the company s fixed income investments of million and million  respectively 
similarly  a and basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a pre tax increase in the market value of the company s fixed income investments of million and million  respectively
