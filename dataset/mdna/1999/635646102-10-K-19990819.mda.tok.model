com had approximately  and  in excess of the minimum required net capital requirements  respectively  representing increases of  for sherwood securities and  for ndb 
com  from the prior year 
the increases for sherwood securities and ndb 
com resulted primarily from the year s net income 
the net capital rule imposes financial restrictions upon sherwood securities and ndb 
com s businesses  which are more severe than those imposed on most other businesses 
cash flows from operations vary on a daily basis as the company s portfolio of marketable securities changes 
the company s ability to convert marketable securities owned into cash is determined by the depth of the market and the size of the company s security positions in relation to the market as a whole 
the portfolio mix also affects the regulatory capital requirements imposed on sherwood securities and ndb 
com  which directly affects the amount of funds available for operating  investing and financing activities 
from time to time  the company has borrowed funds in connection with its trading activities 
the company currently has no committed lines of credit and such borrowings were done on an as needed basis 
management is reviewing alternatives to meeting these funding requirements

com during the year ended may  in connection with the upgrade of ndb 
com s technological infrastructure

during the year ended may   the company made two loans of  each to ndb 
com  in the form of subordination agreements 
in july  ndb group contributed  to ndb 
com 
these funds were expended in order for ndb 
com to maintain adequate regulatory capital levels 
the company will make additional loans or contributions to its broker dealer subsidiaries  as necessary  to ensure regulatory compliance 
on december   the company announced it would by back up to  shares of the company s common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
in june  the board of directors authorized an interim program to repurchase up to an additional  shares of the company s common stock 
as of may    shares had been reacquired  of which  shares were repurchased during the fiscal year ended may  the source of the funds for these purchases was internally generated 
as a result of equitrade s acquisition on december  of rsf partners assets  including the right to act as a specialist in securities on the nyse  the nyse required equitrade to increase its capital to  in order to increase equitrade s capital  a  subordinated loan was made to equitrade by ndb group

effects of inflation the company s assets are not significantly affected by inflation because they are primarily monetary in nature 
management believes that replacement costs of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements will not materially affect operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects the company s principal expenses such as employee benefits and compensation  rent and communication  which may not be readily recoverable from increased revenues 
due to market forces and competitive conditions in the securities industry  a broker dealer may be unable to unilaterally increase spreads and commissions in order to recover increased costs related to inflation 
consequently  the company must rely on increased volume for this purpose 
however  the company has significant cash balances on deposit with its principal clearing broker which  in the event there are higher interest rates  would offset some of the costs 
impact of the year issue this material is subject to the year information and readiness disclosure act of state of readiness the company is preparing for the issues associated with the year  including changes in the programming of internal and vendor computer systems 
the year problem is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computer systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the company s plan to deal with the year issue is a five step plan  which includes both information technology it and non information technology non it systems 
it systems include the company s trading system  the company s accounting software and the ndb 
com webstationtm 
non it systems include the company s headquarters water  sprinkler and elevator systems 
the five steps are awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
awareness required the notification of all employees  particularly senior management  of the potential year problem 
assessment included taking inventory of every product or service produced or used by the company that relies on the use of dates 
the date could be used to store  search  retrieve or calculate information 
the awareness and assessment phases of the plan were complete as of may  renovation  which has also been substantially completed as of may   includes the conversion of year non compliant systems into year compliant systems 
the company believes that internal software and hardware identified as non compliant have been made compliant or replaced  in all material respects  as of may   except that the company was notified by nasdaq that the operating systems of certain of its level ii workstations need to be upgraded to be compliant 
the company intends to upgrade these workstations by august  the company internally verified compliance of its new ndb 
com webstationtm by august validation comprises the testing of all systems by using test data with dates that include the year this is the certification phase of the company s production platforms 
implementation will be a final review of all year production systems  it and non it  in service 
the company has constructed a dedicated year test development environment to eliminate potential risks to the production platforms for use in the validation phase of this plan 
the company completed  in all material respects  the validation and implementation phases by june  the company is dependent upon services rendered by third parties  such as telecommunications  electric and clearance  which may have a material effect on operations 
except as indicated below  these essential service providers have indicated to the company that they will be year compliant in time to meet the company s schedule  although management presently has no assurance that such plans will be implemented on a timely basis 
the company has been unable to obtain verification that the building located at new york plaza  new york  new york is year compliant 
on an interim basis  ndb 
com has some of its operational units in this building 
ndb 
com is arranging for the performance of these operations at its other locations in the event year problems prevent utilization of this space 
sherwood securities continues to conduct market tests with communication lines pursuant to which it receives order flow 
not all of these tests have been successfuly completed as of the date of this report 
however  both ndb 
com and sherwood securities intend to continue to enhance and modify mission critical systems as necessary after june  the company intends to test each enhancement or modification to determine if it is year compliant 
the company is aware that its clearing brokers may not be willing to modify their systems until after january  in response to requests by the company to make changes to accommodate enhancements to its systems 
costs the company estimates that it will spend  for software modifications  hardware and testing related to year through may   the company has spent approximately  of which  was incurred during the fiscal year ended may  the company does not track internal costs related to year issues  which consist primarily of payroll expenses and  as a result  the foregoing estimate and actual expenditures do not include such internal costs 
the company has assessed that business interruption is the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario  although the effect upon the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition is unknown 
contingency plan at this time  the company has formulated contingency plans should internal systems  vendors or customers fail to become compliant or fail to operate as a result of year problems 
in case of a non replaceable vendor suffering a failure in the year  the company could be materially affected 
looking ahead during the fiscal year ending may   the company intends to execute the following strategic plan 
as a result of the underwritten public offering of its common stock that closed on june  and the sale of equitrade on june   the company has accumulated cash of approximately  including the return of its invested capital at equitrade

the estimated cost of this project is  most of the expenditures are projected to occur during the fiscal year ending may  ndb group has formed a new subsidiary  millennium clearing corp  which will serve as the vehicle to clearing transactions initially for ndb 
com and sherwood securities and later for third parties 
the company estimates that approximately  will be needed to satisfy regulatory net capital requirements for this operation 
additional funds will be expended for the start up of the operation 
the company estimates that millennium will commence operation during the year ending december  millennium will be required to register as a broker dealer and seek other regulatory clearances prior to the commencement of business 
while the company believes self clearing ndb 
com and sherwood securities will eventually reduce clearing expenses for these entities  there can be no assurance that this will occur or if it occurs when the savings will be achieved 
in addition  ndb 
com intends to continue to invest in the development and introduction of new products 
products being reviewed are access to initial public offerings  insurance and banking products  electronic bill presentment and payment and credit products 
management of the company believes these investments and innovations are required to compete in the rapidly evolving businesses of market making and discount retail brokerage
