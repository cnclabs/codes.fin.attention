during this storm  the company s floating loading ramp was damaged 
the company contracted for the ramp to be re floated and repaired 
the top section of the structure was partially removed 
in january the ramp was successfully re floated 
the ramp was repaired and returned to active cargo operations for the first two decks in march  the top section is expected to be reinstalled in late march or early april  at which time normal operations will resume on all three decks 
the cost of re floating the ramp structure and its repair was insured and the company expects to receive reimbursement of these expenses  less a  deductible 
the owner of the san juan ramp structure waived  in charter hire payments in the third quarter of to partially offset the expected additional costs incurred by the company due to the unavailability of the san juan ramp structure 
the company reported an operating loss of million for compared to operating income  excluding the nonrecurring  non cash charge for compensation  of million for the company recorded a nonrecurring  non cash charge for compensation and a credit to paid in capital of million during this charge represented the difference between the exercise price of the option and the initial public offering price of per share 
operating income was negatively impacted by million of additional costs related to the disruption caused by the loss of use of the san juan ramp structure resulting from hurricane georges 
the million of estimated additional costs included  in additional operating and maintenance costs comprised primarily of stevedoring and port related items   in additional rent and purchased transportation expense comprised primarily of terminal equipment rental  trucking expense in san juan and the us and revenue equipment rental   in salaries and wages   in insurance and claims and  in communications and other operating expenses 
the inability to utilize the san juan ramp structure necessitated alternative methods of discharging and re loading the two ro ro vessels 
instead of typical cargo operations of between and hours at the company s san juan terminal  the two ro ro vessels utilized other terminals where total cargo operations required between and hours 
while the ramp was out of service  the middle deck of the ro ro vessels remained inaccessible to trailers and could be used only for vehicles  which resulted in sub optimum utilization of one third of vessel space 
the additional time required to service the ro ro vessels in san juan resulted in schedule tightness that required most cargo operations to be performed during weekends where higher overtime rates applied 
this schedule tightness and the resultant uncertainty affected costs in addition to those directly related to san juan cargo operations  including trucking costs on the mainland 
the company s goal during this period of disruption  which lasted longer than expected  was to continue to provide a high level of service to customers despite certain adverse cost consequences 
the triplestack box carriers tm do not utilize the floating ramp structure and were not adversely affected by hurricane georges 
operating expenses for increased million or from exclusive of the charge for compensation in discussed above 
this increase was due to an increase in expenses associated with an overall increase in puerto rico volume  and the million in additional costs related to the inefficiency of servicing the ro ro vessels while the san juan ramp structure was out of service and the impact of the commencement of the new coastwise service 
as a result  the company s operating ratio increased to during from during exclusive of the charge for compensation in interest expense net increased  or to million in from  in due to increased average long term debt outstanding  increased amounts outstanding under the company s revolving line of credit and less interest income earned on short term investments

presently  approximately two thirds of trailer bridge s car volume is represented by new cars 
revenue from shipper owned equipment and other vehicles increased 
million or in compared to while trailer volume from puerto rico increased in  related revenue decreased 
million or compared to due to rate pressure on the limited volumes moving inbound from puerto rico 
vessel capacity utilization on the core continental us to puerto rico traffic lane was during  compared to during when a smaller substitute vessel was utilized 
in connection with the grant of an option by the company s principal stockholder to its chairman and ceo  the company recorded a nonrecurring  non cash charge for compensation and a credit to paid in capital of million during this charge represented the difference between the exercise price of the option and the initial public offering price of per share 
the option does not involve the issuance of additional shares of common stock by the company and therefore  any subsequent purchase of shares under the option will not have a dilutive effect on the company s book value or earnings per share amounts 
as a result of this option  the company sustained a pro forma net loss of million or 
per share  for excluding the charge for compensation discussed above  operating expenses for increased million from this increase was due to an increase in expenses associated with an overall increase in puerto rico volume  offset by a decrease in handling costs from related to the complexity and inefficiency of loading substitute vessels during the mid body expansion project 
as a result  excluding the charge for compensation the company s operating ratio improved to during from during interest expense net decreased  to  in from million in due to reductions in amounts owed to an affiliate  the capitalization of interest related to new vessel construction and increased interest income resulting from the unused proceeds of the company s initial public offering

at december  cash amounted to million  working capital was million  and stockholders equity amounted to million 
management believes that available borrowings under lines of credit  equipment financings and cash flow generated from operations will allow the company to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures and other obli gations at least through calendar year the year issue derives from computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to determine the applicable year 
the company recognizes that the approach of the year brings a unique challenge to the ability of computer systems to recognize the date change from december   to january  as a result  the arrival of the year could result in system failures or miscalculations  causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or to conduct other normal business activity 
management of the company concluded that year would impact its internal information technology it and non information technology non it systems 
in addition  the company believes that the year will impact its supplier chain environment and electronic data interchange environment 
the company has designated a group of personnel to manage the conversion process for its own internal systems  including purchased software  and to monitor the conversion process for supplier chain environment systems and effects  as well as for the company s data interchange environment 
a discussion of the status of each of these areas follows internal it and non it systems year conversions within the company s mainframe environment have been completed 
mainframe environment conversions included the company s hardware and operating systems  its customized applications  and its purchased software 
the year conversion for customized applications is year operational at the present time 
the company elected to retain certain purchased software systems and replace certain other purchased software systems 
installation of year compliant versions of retained and purchased software systems have been completed 
the carrying value of software systems to be replaced for year compliance is nominal 
year conversions of the company s desk top environment  which includes network hardware and operating systems software  as well as the networked pc hardware operating systems and applications inventory  were completed in the company has completed year conversions of its electronic data interchange software 
external it and non it systems the company is in the process of obtaining an inventory of critical exposure arising from the company s suppliers 
the company s list of suppliers includes financial institutions  telecommunications providers  utility companies and insurance providers  as well as basic suppliers critical to the operations of the company 
the company has sent and is continuing to send questionnaires to suppliers considered to be significant to operations to determine their status with respect to year issues 
the company continually updates its list of critical exposures 
the company has completed an inventory of year exposure with respect to data communication business partners 
the company does not have any single customer that would be material to the company as a whole 
however  the company has some customers which  in the aggregate  are significant to the company s operations and financial results 
the company is in the process of surveying significant customers readiness for year the information provided by significant customers with respect to their year readiness will be considered in the development of the company s contingency plan 
year costs the company is using existing and contract personnel to perform year conversions and evaluations of third party systems 
since the beginning of the process  the company estimates its expenditures at approximately  including labor costs and costs that relate to equipment and software purchases 
year costs have been absorbed in the company s normal operating expenses which are funded with the company s internally generated funds or its revolving credit facility 
the company s cash flows have not been adversely impacted to a material degree by year costs 
it is management s conclusion that there have been no significant projects deferred as a result of year efforts 
the company does not expect to incur additional expenditures for year conversion costs 
contingency planning the company is in the process of developing an assessment of its most reasonably likely worst case year scenario and its year contingency plan 
the responses the company receives from suppliers regarding their year readiness will play a critical role in these determinations 
the company currently plans to have made an assessment of its most reasonably likely worst case year scenario by april  this and other relevant information will be utilized to develop the company s contingency plan 
it is presently expected that the contingency plan will be developed by june  like virtually all other public and private companies  the company s day to day business is dependent on telecommunications services  banking services and utility services provided by a large number of entities 
at this time  the company is not aware of any of these entities or of any significant suppliers or customers that has disclosed that it will not be year compliant by january  however  many of these entities are  like the company  still engaged in the process of attempting to become year compliant 
the company plans to attempt to obtain written assurance of year compliance from all entities which management considers critical to operations of the company 
however  it is likely that some critical suppliers or customers will not give written assurance as to year compliance because of concerns as to legal liability 
even where written assurance is provided by critical suppliers or customers and a contingency plan is developed by the company to deal with possible non compliance by other critical suppliers or customers  the year conversion process will continue to create risk to the company which is outside the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that a major year disruption will not occur in a critical supplier or customer which would have a material impact on the company 
inflation inflation has had a minimal effect upon the company s profitability in recent years 
most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
the company expects that inflation will affect its costs no more than it affects those of other truckload and marine carriers 
seasonality the company s marine operations are subject to the seasonality of the puerto rico freight market where shipments are generally reduced during the first calendar quarter and increased during the fourth calendar quarter of each year in anticipation of christmas 
this seasonality is expected to have a greater impact with the company s additional capacity
