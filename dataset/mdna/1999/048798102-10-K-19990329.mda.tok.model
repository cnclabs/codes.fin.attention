capital resources and liquidity atlantic realty trust upon consummation of the spin off transaction  the trust owned seven mortgage loans and three retail properties hylan  located in staten island  new york  the norgate shopping center located in indianapolis  indiana and the north wabash avenue building  located in chicago  illinois  as well as cash and certain other assets  which include furniture  fixtures and equipment  formerly held by rps 
in addition  upon consummation of the spin off transaction  the trust assumed the repayment obligation in respect of  in indebtedness from rps 
this indebtedness was evidenced by a promissory note which bore interest at a rate of and matured on november  the promissory note 
the promissory note was secured by a collateral assignment of the trust s interest in the hylan shopping center 
on july   the trust repaid  of the principal balance of the promissory note 
on december  the trust prepaid the remaining balance of  the trust does not intend to make new loans or actively engage in either the mortgage lending or the property acquisition business 
the trust s primary objective has been to liquidate its assets in an eighteen month period from the date of the spin off transaction while realizing the maximum values for such assets  however because the rps tax issues have not been satisfactorily resolved  the trust has continued its business beyond such period 
although the trust considers its assumptions and estimates as to the values and timing of such liquidations to be reasonable  the period of time to liquidate the assets and distribute the proceeds of such assets is subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond the trust s control 
there can be no assurance that the net values ultimately realized and costs actually incurred for such assets will not materially differ from the trust s estimate 
the trust believes that cash and cash equivalents on hand  proceeds generated by the real estate property that continues to operate hylan and proceeds from the eventual sale of such property will be sufficient to support the trust and meet its obligations 
as of december   the trust had approximately  in cash and short term investments 
during the first quarter of  the trust received net proceeds of approximately  from the sale of the norgate shopping center 
at december  the trust s remaining real property asset was the hylan 
during the third quarter of  the trust received proceeds in the aggregate of approximately  in connection with the disposition of the north wabash building  and the mt 
morris commons mortgage loan during the second quarter of  the trust received proceeds of approximately  in connection with the disposition of the rector mortgage loan  and the copps hill plaza mortgage loan 
at december  the trust owned two retail properties  hylan and the norgate shopping center  which was sold by the trust on february  during the period ended december   the trust received proceeds of approximately  from the prepayment of four mortgage loans 
at december   the trust owned three mortgage loans and the three retail properties discussed above 
as of december   the trust had disposed of all of its mortgage loans 
the trust intends to reduce to cash or cash equivalents its remaining asset in an orderly manner as soon as practicable and make a liquidating distribution or distributions to its shareholders  or merge or combine operations with another real estate entity 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to determine the applicable year 
any programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the trust has purchased new computer hardware and software that is year compliant for its corporate operations and has ordered computer hardware and software that is year compliant at its hylan management office 
management estimates that the total costs incurred  or to be incurred in  in connection with such improvements to be approximately the trust also depends upon the proper functioning of third party computer and non information technology systems 
these third parties include tenants  commercial banks and other lenders  construction contractors and vendors 
the trust has initiated communications with third parties with whom it has important financial or operational relationships to determine the extent to which they are vulnerable to the year issue 
the trust has received written notification from two of its three significant outside service providers that their systems correctly identify and process date data relating to the year issue 
the third significant outside service provider has indicated to the trust that it has designed a plan to achieve year compliance and that such plan is substantially in place and expected to be complete ahead of schedule 
the trust plans to contact its major tenants in the second quarter of to inquire about such tenant s year readiness 
if third parties with whom the trust interacts have year problems that are not remedied  the following problems could result i in the case of vendors  disruption of important services upon which the trust depends  such as professional services  including accounting and legal services  telecommunications and electrical power  and ii in the case of banks and other lenders  the disruption of capital flows potentially resulting in liquidity stress 
the trust does not believe the year issue will materially impact its tenant s ability to pay rent 
however  financial difficulties of significant tenants as a result of the year issues could have a material adverse effect on the trust s results of operations or financial position 
though the trust does not expect the year issue to have a material adverse effect on its result of operations or financial position  there can be no assurances of that position 
net assets to be transferred to atlantic realty trust the following information is based upon the consolidated financial statements of the net assets to be transferred to the trust  which were derived from rps historical financial statements to reflect the transfer of the assets to the trust as a result of the distribution 
the financial information  and the discussion that follows  assumes that the assets were transferred to the trust at the beginning of the periods indicated  and that the trust and rps were separate companies with separate operations as of such dates 
the allocation of certain expenses between the trust and rps was determined by using the weighted average of the trust s total assets to rps total assets and the trust s total revenues to rps total revenues and reflects management s best estimate of the appropriate allocation of such expenses between the two companies 
as described below  the trust has utilized a weighted average of approximately   and for the purpose of allocating such expenses for the period january  through may  date of transfer and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results of operations period from january  to may  compared to period from january  to may  interest income on mortgage loans for the period ended may  decreased by approximately  or as compared to the period ended may  during the period  the trust received contingent interest of  as compared to none during the comparable period 
the trust also received  in extension fee income during the period
