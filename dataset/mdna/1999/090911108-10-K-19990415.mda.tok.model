item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations as compared to sales for were  compared to  reported in the decrease in sales reflects primarily a decrease in shipments of the company s laser based hydrokinetic tm systems during the first nine months of due principally to a reduction in the company s export sales during  down approximately  from those reported in the reduction in export sales was due primarily to a decrease in sales to the company s german distributor which had been the most significant customer for millennium tm systems in the german distributor requested a deferral of millennium tm systems pending a partial redesign of the hand piece to address more effectively the requirements of the german market 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales during of  in aggregate to the company s new italian and canadian distributors 
the company expects that completion of the hand piece redesign effort and the successful testing of the redesigned hand piece will result in a resumption of sales to the german market and further increase sales to other countries within the european community 
the united states food and drug administration fda in october granted clearance to the company to market the millennium tm system in the united states for certain dental hard tissue applications 
the fda had previously granted clearance for the marketing of millennium tm for certain soft tissue applications 
the october action by the fda has permitted the company to commence active marketing of the millennium tm system in the united states 
sales for december were  attributable primarily to sales of millennium tm systems 
this represents a dramatic increase over sales for october and november  bringing total fourth quarter sales to  increased sales during december are attributable to initial domestic market acceptance of the millennium tm  more aggressive marketing through the company s expanded domestic sales force and the addition of new international distributors 
the company expects that this level of increased sales will continue into commencing june  sales of millennium tm systems replaced sales of an earlier generation of laser system which had been phased out by early and are currently not being sold or marketed by the company 
in august  the company introduced its first consumer product  the lazersmile tm tooth whitening system  which utilizes a monochromatic optical energy light source embedded within a toothbrush in conjunction with a clear  non abrasive tooth whitening gel 
the company recognized a nominal amount of revenue from lazersmile tm test marketing in the company is attempting to establish marketing and distribution alliances with third parties to effect the distribution of lazersmile tm 
these alliances could include arrangements involving television shopping channels  specialty catalogs and traditional distribution arrangements 
no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in establishing these alliances or that  if they are established  they will result in the successful commercialization of lazersmile tm 
gross profits were  or of net sales  in  compared to  or of net sales  in the company s laser division reported a gross loss of  on net sales of  in  compared to a gross profit of  on net sales of  in the decrease in gross profits in was due principally to production inefficiencies brought about by the delay in receipt of the anticipated fda hard tissue clearance coupled with ongoing product development 
gross profit margins attributable to the millennium tm were still below desired levels in and remain below desired levels into the company expects to realize improved margins on its millennium tm sales during through improved production layouts  other production efficiencies and lower cost of materials 
gross profit in was adversely affected by a  increase in the inventory reserve related to the termination of the active marketing of the company s prior generation of laser based systems 
the company s endodontic division reported gross profits in of  compared to  in operating expenses  net of write off of purchased research and development costs  increased  or  to  in  compared to  in sales and marketing expenses increased  to  in  compared to  reported in the increase was due mainly to greater participation by the company at various dermatological and dental trade shows  payroll and other costs associated with the company s establishment of a domestic sales force  its continued pursuit of qualified international distributors  and the initial sales efforts associated with the introduction of lazersmile tm 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  in  compared to  reported in this change was primarily a result of increased expenses associated with advertising and promotion of the company through various publications and investor forums  public relation announcements associated with the company s products and regulatory clearances  and increases in employee related expenses associated with increased staffing and additions to management 
engineering and development expenses reported in were  compared to  reported in the increase relates principally to costs associated with the redesign of the millennium tm hand piece  enhancements to the existing millennium tm configuration and the finalization of the design of lazersmile tm in anticipation of its product launch 
in connection with the acquisition of laser skin toner inc lsti  the company allocated the  price to incomplete research and development 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on future cash flows 
the company s management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the purchased in process research and development ipr d 
the value ascribed to ipr d reflects the asset s completion percentage of approximately 
at the acquisition date  the development of this project had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
the value assigned to this asset was determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established 
in the case of lsti  this included the development  prototyping  and testing activities associated with the creation of a proprietary laser based skin resurfacing system  a new laser system for the field of aesthetic skin rejuvenation 
valuation of development efforts in the future has been excluded from the research and development appraisal 
the nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in process technology into a technologically and commercially viable product relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  and fda approval activities that are necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet their design specifications including functional  technical  and economic performance requirements 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the contribution of the purchased in process technology in developing a viable product  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the expected sales of such a product  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate 
revenue growth rates for lsti were estimated based on a detailed forecast prepared by management of the company and lsti 
revenue growth rates beyond were based on industry growth expectations 
allocation of total lsti projected revenues to ipr d was based on an analysis by the management of the company and lsti 
the preponderance of future revenue associated with the lsti technology is expected to originate from the sale of products that are not yet completed 
selling  general and administrative expenses and profitability estimates were determined based on management forecasts as well as an analysis of comparable companies margin expectations 
the projections utilized in the transaction pricing and purchase price allocation analysis exclude the potential synergistic benefits related specifically to the company s ownership 
due to the relatively early stage of the development and reliance on future  unproven products and technologies  the cost of capital discount rate for lsti was estimated using venture capital rates of return 
due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the development projects  a discount rate of was used to discount anticipated cash flows from the in process product 
this discount rate is commensurate with lsti s market position and the uncertainties related to the economic estimates described above  the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and technological advances that could render even lsti s development stage technologies obsolete 
the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary significantly from projected results 
the company believes that substantial progress had been made through the date of acquisition in the design and development of the laser receptacle  fiber and jacket  fiber proximal end  hand piece  wand  pneumatic control system and distal ends for certain applications 
at that date  additional efforts were required to refine these elements of the laser system  complete the design and development of other elements of the laser system  produce and test prototype laser systems  engage in clinical trials  and apply for and obtain regulatory clearances 
the company recognizes that at any stage in this process it might encounter technical obstacles to the utilization of the lsti technology for skin resurfacing which  if not surmounted  could cause the termination and abandonment of the development effort  since no alternative use for the technology exists 
in addition  there is no assurance that any product successfully developed on the basis of the lsti technology would receive market acceptance 
the company estimates that the additional research and development effort required to complete the development project would cost approximately  and would take approximately nine months of concentrated effort 
at the time of acquisition  the company intended to proceed with those additional research and development efforts promptly and to fund the costs from working capital 
in anticipation of and then in response to the clearance it received in october from the fda to market its millennium tm tissue cutting system for dental hard tissue applications  the company shortly after acquiring the lsti technology decided to focus its limited resources on the marketing of its millennium tm system  including a build up of inventory and expansion of sales staff 
as a result  the additional research and development that will be required in an effort to complete and commercialize the lsti technology has been largely deferred until company resources permit resumption of the research and development efforts 
limited clinical trials of the developmental technology have continued  and the results of those clinical trials are being analyzed and evaluated by the company and will be utilized to define the additional research and development activities 
the company does recognize that any advantage that the lsti technology could have afforded the company may be dissipated by delaying efforts to commercialize that technology  as competing technologies may be developed and receive market acceptance 
the company has not significantly changed its estimates regarding the time and resources required to complete the development of the lsti technology 
if the development of the lsti technology is unsuccessful  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
commercial results are also subject to uncertain market events and risks which are beyond the company s control  such as trends in technology  changes in government regulation  market size and growth  and product introductions or other actions by competitors 
interest income decreased  to  in  compared to  in this decrease reflects lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and interest bearing marketable securities 
interest expense increased  to  in  compared to  in  due to the existence of borrowings under a line of credit during the entire period as compared to only one month during results of operations as compared to sales for were  compared to  reported in  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily due to the laser division s shipments of the company s new hydrokinetic tm tissue cutting system  the millennium tm to the company s german distributor 
the company s endodontic division reported sales of  in compared to sales of  in in july  the company received clearance from the fda to market in the united states a laser based surgical tissue cutting system that utilizes a variation of the millennium tm technology for a broad range of dermatological and general surgical soft tissue applications 
in response to this clearance  the company intends to introduce to the domestic market a laser based system in a configuration that is designed for lower power settings than those of the millennium tm system 
the company is presently developing its marketing plan for such a system and expects it to begin to contribute to sales late in gross profits were  or of net sales in  compared to  or of net sales in the company s laser division reported a gross profit of  on net sales of  in  compared to a gross loss of  on net sales of  in gross profit margins attributable to the millennium tm are still below desired levels 
the continued design and manufacturing of various test and production fixtures contributed to the manufacturing inefficiencies experienced during the year 
additionally  gross profit in was affected by an increase in the inventory reserve related to the company s prior generation nylad tm laser based systems of  the company s endodontic division reported gross profits in of  compared to  in operating expenses increased  or  to  in  compared to  in sales and marketing expenses increased  to  in  compared to  reported in the increase was due mainly to greater participation by the company at various dermatological and dental trade shows  payroll and other costs associated with the company s establishment of a domestic sales force and its continued pursuit of qualified international distributors 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  in  compared to  reported in this change was due principally to increases in i a charge of  related to common stock issued in connection with the company obtaining a  credit facility for the financing of inventories  ii costs related to domestic and foreign patents and patent applications  iii legal costs related primarily to regulatory  contractual and international matters  iv public relations costs incurred by promotion of the company through various publications and investor forums  and v a  increase in the provision for bad debt as a result of a bank claiming technical defects in documentation and thereby refusing to honor a letter of credit for goods shipped to a foreign customer 
the company has recently filed a complaint against the foreign customer in the united states district court for various claims including collection of the  debt 
engineering and development expenses reported in were  compared to  reported in the moderate increase in these expenses related primarily to costs incurred with respect to clinical studies utilizing the company s hydrokinetic tm technology in its effort to obtain clearance by the fda to market the millennium tm system for certain dental hard tissue applications and final development costs related to the company s lazersmile tm 
these year costs were partially offset by a reduction in project design costs related to the millennium tm system as the present version was placed into production during the second quarter of interest income increased  to  in  compared to  in this increase was due to higher levels of united states treasury notes held during financial condition the company s working capital requirements have been financed over the past several years through the private placement of the company s equity securities 
such placements generated net proceeds of   and  during  and  respectively 
in march  the company raised approximately  of net proceeds through a private placement of equity securities 
in addition  the company financed its inventory build up through a  increase in the amount drawn under a short term line of credit 
the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased  during operating activities in utilized  of cash 
investing activities in  not including the liquidation of marketable securities  utilized  of cash  while financing activities provided  of cash 
accounts receivable decreased  during the decrease is attributable primarily to the payment during of  by the german distributor of millennium tm for sales made during the effect of this payment was partially offset by accounts receivable in relating to sales aggregating  made during december inventories increased  from to  reflecting the company s decision to continue to build subassemblies for its millennium tm system while awaiting completion of the redesign of the millennium tm hand piece and clearance from the fda to market millennium tm in the united states for dental hard tissue applications 
there was also a build up of inventory in connection with the product launch of lazersmile tm 
the company believes that through its operations involved primarily research and development while awaiting key regulatory clearances and that accordingly its operations did not reflect normal business cycles  so that information about inventory turns would not be meaningful 
the company believes that such information should become meaningful once a pattern of deliveries of millennium tm systems has been established 
the company s inventory reserve decreased by  during  as the company wrote off its nylad tm and laser tm laser based systems  which are no longer being marketed or sold by the company 
liability under a line of credit established in december to finance inventory increased  from to this increase is associated with the build up of inventory required to support the company s current sales level 
the company has extended this line of credit through june  and has the option to extend it for an additional six month period 
the aggregate of accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased  from december  to december  this increase is attributable to increased purchases of materials late in in connection with an effort to increase millennium tm production to systems per month  as well as the company s conservation of cash resources 
capital expenditures during totaled  primarily related to the purchase of plastic injection molds for the production of the lazersmile tm 
patents  trademarks and licenses in increased  from principally as a result of the company pursuing patent and trademark protection for its proprietary technology  names and symbols 
stockholders equity at december  was  compared to  at december  in may  the company completed a private placement of  shares of common stock for net proceeds of  in july  the company completed the acquisition of the assets of lsti by issuing  shares of common stock  net of  held in escrow  valued at  these increases in stockholders equity were offset by the current year loss of  which included a  write off of purchased in process research and development costs for which no alternative use existed 
liquidity and capital resources the company remains dependent upon its ability to obtain outside financing either through the issuance of additional shares of its common or preferred stock or through borrowings until it achieves sustained profitability through increased sales and cost containment 
the company s business now focuses and is expected to continue to focus on the manufacturing and marketing of its laser based hydrokinetic tm tissue cutting system  the millennium tm  a new  reduced power variation of the millennium tm which is being configured for applications in dermatology and general soft tissue surgery  and its recently released consumer tooth whitening system  the lazersmile tm toothbrush 
financing the development of laser based medical and dental devices and instruments and the operations of the company has been achieved principally through the private placements of preferred and common stock and the exercise of stock options and warrants  though the company has experienced increased sales of its millennium tm system during december and the first quarter of during the three years ended december   the company raised approximately  of equity funds in this manner 
management believes that the company will require significant resources in  principally to fund the company s working capital needs to support the production and marketing of the company s laser based products for various dental and medical applications  efforts directed towards further extensions and refinements of existing products  and continuing research and development activities 
the company expects to generate the necessary resources for its business plan through a combination of the contribution from the sales of its products  the sale of equity securities in a private placement  and debt financing 
no assurances can be given  however  that the company will be able to obtain such additional resources 
if the company is unsuccessful in generating anticipated resources from one or more of the anticipated sources and is unable to replace any shortfall with resources from another source  the company may be able to extend the period for which available resources would be adequate by deferring the creation or satisfaction of various commitments  deferring the introduction of various products or entry into various markets  and otherwise scaling back operations 
if the company were unable to generate the required resources  its ability to meet its obligations and to continue its operations would be adversely affected 
the company s financial statements have been prepared under the assumption of a going concern 
failure to generate required resources and to achieve sustained profitability would have an adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  cash flows and prospects of the company and ultimately on its ability to continue as a going concern 
in march   the company completed a private placement in which it issued  shares of its common stock   redeemable warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of per share and  redeemable warrants to purchase common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire march  and allow for the company to call the warrants  with not less than days written notice  at a redemption price of 
each  provided that the average between the high and low prices at which the shares of common stock trade in the principal market in which they then trade exceeds of the exercise price for ten consecutive trading days preceding the date of such call 
gross proceeds received from the private placement were  net proceeds  after placement agent cash commissions and expenses of  and estimated expenses incurred by the company of  were approximately  at december   the company had  outstanding under a revolving credit agreement with a bank 
the revolving credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to  for the financing of inventory and is collateralized by substantially all of the company s accounts receivable and inventories 
the interest rate is fixed throughout the term of the credit agreement and is computed based upon libor plus at the time of any borrowings 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balance was 
the company is required to reduce the outstanding loan balance by an amount equal to the cost of goods sold associated with sales of inventory upon collection of sales proceeds 
effective december   the company exercised its right to extend the credit agreement for an additional six months by issuing  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the value of the shares and warrants so issued was  which was recorded as expense in the current revolving credit agreement expires on june   and the company has one six month renewal option remaining 
the company expects that it will exercise its option to extend the line of credit through december  the company will be required  however  to pay off or refinance this line of credit by december  no assurances can be given that the company will be able to refinance the line of credit or that the terms on which it may be able to refinance the line of credit will be as favorable as the terms of the existing line 
if the company is unable to refinance and therefore required to repay the line of credit  the diversion of resources to that purpose may adversely affect the company s operations and financial condition 
the company is presently continuing its analysis of its computer software and hardware requirements  including non information technology systems  and anticipates capital expenditures to increase significantly during in connection with the acquisition of such software and hardware 
included among the software to be purchased would be a new accounting system 
that system  unlike the present system  would be year compliant 
the company s present software and hardware is personal computer based and is unaltered from its original purchased state except for those upgrades offered by the suppliers of such software 
the company has received assurances from the suppliers of the software it employs  other than the accounting system software  that such software is year compliant 
the company intends to obtain certification that any computer software and hardware purchased in is year compliant 
the company does not believe that its insistence upon year compliant hardware or software will materially increase the cost of any hardware or software acquired 
should the company be unable to obtain year compliant software or hardware  the worst case scenario would require the company to transition to a manual financial reporting and information gathering system 
the year problem arises out of the convention by which years have been represented in computer programs by a two digit number representing the final two digits in the year s designation and concern that time sensitive components could fail or provide erroneous output if they do not correctly recognize years beginning with rather than the company currently has limited information regarding the year compliance status of its principal suppliers of goods and services and of its principal customers 
the company has initiated formal communications with all such suppliers and customers with respect to the status of such persons computer systems in terms of year compliance 
if any principal customers lack systems that are year compliant or programs that provide reasonable assurance that such systems will be year compliant well before the end of  the company will attempt to establish communications channels with such customers that bypass the non compliant computer systems 
if any principal suppliers lack systems that are year compliant or programs that provide reasonable assurance that such systems will be year compliant well before the end of  the company will attempt to identify and establish relations with alternate suppliers who have year compliant systems 
there is a single source supplier of optic fiber for the millennium tm which could not be easily replaced if it has non compliant systems  and in the event such supplier had a non compliant system  the company would attempt to establish communications channels with such supplier that bypass the supplier s non compliant computer system 
there can be no assurance however that the company would be successful in locating new suppliers and an inability to do so could create difficulties in the company obtaining certain components used in its manufacturing process 
the company believes that the costs associated with monitoring year compliance by suppliers and customers and dealing with any non compliance will not be material 
the failure of the company or any of its principal suppliers and customers to become year compliant in a timely manner and the failure to establish alternate communications channels could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow
