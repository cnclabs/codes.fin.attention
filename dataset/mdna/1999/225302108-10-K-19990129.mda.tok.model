for a further discussion of the company s business  and risk factors affecting its results of operations  please refer to the section entitled risk factors included elsewhere herein 
results of operations vs net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from the sale of systems  upgrades  spare parts  maintenance contracts and software 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  however  the company s net sales decreased from million in the first quarter of fiscal to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal the year over year increase over was driven primarily by increased worldwide demand for semiconductor automatic test equipment ate  including the company s products  during the end of calendar and including the first quarter of the company s fiscal this was followed by a very significant decline in worldwide demand for semiconductor ate  which led to a material decline in net sales of the company s products in the last three quarters of fiscal during fiscal  the company s net sales were also materially adversely affected by its inability to complete three major product introductions  consisting of the vs high performance digital tester  the quartet high performance mixed signal tester and the kalos memory tester 
the company believes that its existing completed products were being primarily purchased when its customers required increased capacity and that these three newer products  once completed  will be primarily purchased by customers seeking increased functionality instead of or in addition to increased capacity 
the company believes it will be unable to achieve a significant increase in net sales until either increased demand for semiconductors causes an increase in capacity buys or until the company completes its major product introductions and can generate increased functionality buys with its newer products 
international net sales accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the company s net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively  and thus are subject to the risk of economic instability in that region that materially adversely affected the demand for the company s products in capital markets in korea and other areas of asia have been highly volatile  resulting in economic instabilities 
these instabilities may continue or worsen  which could continue to materially adversely affect demand for the company s products 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to special charges taken in fiscal as a result of a significant decrease in net sales in the last three quarters of fiscal the company recorded special charges to cost of goods sold in totaling million  consisting primarily of write offs for excess or obsolete inventory  as more fully described below 
additionally  gross margins were negatively impacted due to lower average selling prices caused by increased competition in the markets the company serves and due to inefficiencies caused by the lower manufacturing volumes 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses as a percentage of net sales were and  in fiscal and  respectively 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting continued investments in the development of new products  as well as enhancements of existing product lines 
the company currently intends to continue to invest significant resources in the development of new products and enhancements for the foreseeable future  however  the company has taken steps to reduce operating expenses in light of current industry conditions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from marketing costs associated with new product introductions and higher operating expenses associated with acquisitions made during and the last half of fiscal  partially offset by decreases in expenditures in the latter three quarters of fiscal as the company responded to the general downturn in the semiconductor industry 
during this period of depressed revenues  the company has undertaken a project to replace a majority of its financial  manufacturing  distribution  planning and control systems with the r system from sap america  inc  and anticipates that this system will be operational before the end of fiscal this project is intended to improve operational efficiencies to support anticipated future growth in the business 
in process research and development 
in june  the company purchased from heuristics physics laboratories  inc hpl certain assets and assumed certain liabilities relating to their memory self test business for million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities 
additionally  the company agreed to make payments to the shareholder representatives of hpl in an amount equal to of the company s net sales of products derived from the assets acquired from hpl s design for test division for a period of two years following the acquisition 
in connection with the hpl acquisition  the company recognized million of acquired in process research and development ipr d 
the remaining million has been capitalized  of which million is for purchased technology and other intangible assets which will be amortized ratably over their estimated useful lives of five years 
the company s management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets resulting from  or to be used in  research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated  by both interviews and data analysis  to determine its state of development and related fair value 
the company s review indicated that the ipr d had not reached a state of technological feasibility and the underlying technology had no alternative future use to the company in other research and development projects or otherwise 
in the case of ipr d  fair values of the corresponding technologies were determined using an income approach  which included a discounted future earnings methodology 
under this methodology  the value of the in process technology is comprised of the total present value of the anticipated after tax cash flows attributable to the in process project  discounted to net present value  taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d 
the hpl acquired ipr d consists of projects related to memory self test 
these projects are aimed at the development of products that can perform self testing of on chip memories  self testing of off chip memories  automated memory test vector generation  built in memory repair analysis and built in automated memory circuit repair 
the company estimated that approximately of the research and development effort  based on complexity  had been completed at the date of the acquisition 
the significant work remaining on these projects was estimated to take approximately engineering person years  at a cost of approximately million and be completed in late fiscal or early fiscal as of october   the company believed that the projections of time and cost had not materially changed 
as of the acquisition date  hpl was in the alpha stage of development and required the resolution of certain memory self test technological hurdles in order to complete the technology 
the items remaining to be addressed at the acquisition date included the following expansion of built in self test bist capability to address large beyond mega bit embedded memories used in the emerging system on a chip market  completion of third generation bist  automation tools allowing the generation of user configurable test algorithms on the active load board of a test system  completion of manufacturing oriented memory bist architecture enabling parallel test execution and full diagnostics for engineering debug and yield analysis  and completion of the first built in redundancy analyzer  software to direct laser repair stations and embedded memory self repair 
there can be no assurance that these projects will achieve technological feasibility or that the company will be able to successfully market products based on such technology 
should these in process projects fail  the value of the company s investment in these incomplete technologies would be diminimous or zero 
a failure to successfully develop and market memory self test products could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  the company expensed million of ipr d resulting from the acquisition of certain assets of summit design  inc  and summit s wholly owned subsidiary  test systems strategies  inc the tssi acquisition 
the ipr d associated with the tssi acquisition related to the development of a standard tester interface language stil 
the stil development project is approximately complete as of october  the significant technological hurdles remaining to be addressed include the ability to parse mega vector files and make them immediately available to the application program interface  the ability to effectively process both batch and online input from engineering design automation eda simulation tools  the development of efficient algorithms for taking event data from eda simulation tools and mapping it into the limited resources of a given ate system according to a standard set of rules  and the development of additional stil constructs which enable the use of stil as a design stimulus language  enable the use of stil for representing test patterns for embedded cores  representing the test program flow in stil  representing test methods in stil and defining voltage and current levels associated with stil waveforms 
the company estimates that as of october   the remaining research and development work on the stil project will take approximately engineering person years  at a cost of approximately million and will be completed in fiscal the project has progressed more slowly than originally projected due to lower than anticipated staffing 
the lower staffing levels were a result of the company s actions to reduce expenses during a period of reduced revenues and earnings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the development and successful marketing of any stil based products 
a failure to successfully develop and market stil based products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
special charges 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company recorded special charges totaling million  of which million was classified as cost of goods sold and the balance was classified as operating expenses 
these charges were recorded as a result of the company s response to a major downturn in the current and forecasted business outlook for the ate and related semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries which took place during the period 
as a result of this industry downturn  the company has downsized its operations including reducing headcount  reducing the volume of products being produced and cancelling and delaying various projects  including facilities expansions and certain research and development projects 
the impact of this downturn and these decisions is that significant amounts of the company s inventories  receivables  fixed assets  prepaid expenses  investments and purchased technologies have been impaired and certain liabilities have been incurred 
as a result  the company has written down the related assets to their net realizable values and made provision for the estimated liabilities 
of the million in charges  approximately million was charged as cost of goods sold  of which approximately million was related to write down of excess or obsolete inventories 
the elements of the charges during fiscal are as follows in thousands write down of inventories to net realizable value including expected losses on supplier commitments  write down of excess fixed assets to fair value  write down of purchased technology and investments to fair value  write off of prepaid and other current assets  excess facility costs  provision for uncollectible receivables  employee termination benefits and accrued liabilities  at october   approximately million in accrued liabilities related to special charges remained on the company s balance sheet  primarily the accrued loss on supplier commitments of million and approximately million for rent on excess facilities 
the cash expenditures associated with these obligations will occur primarily in fiscal cash expenditures associated with the special charges during fiscal were approximately  relating primarily to excess facilities and to severance costs 
interest income 
the company generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was due to interest earned on significantly higher average cash and investments balances provided by the receipt of proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes issued in late fiscal interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the interest expense on the company s convertible subordinated notes 
income tax 
excluding the impact of in process research and development  the company s effective tax rate for fiscal and was and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the in process research and development  the tax benefit rate in fiscal approximated the combined federal and state statutory rate  while the effective tax rate in was lower  primarily due to the benefit of the company s foreign sales corporation 
realization of a portion of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on the company s ability to generate approximately  of future taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectations of future income 
a valuation allowance has been established in both fiscal and to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets attributable to the in process research and development 
due to the period over which these tax benefits will be recognized  sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the realizability of a portion of these assets to warrant a valuation allowance 
management will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for additional valuation allowances 
vs 
net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the effects of a worldwide downturn in the demand for semiconductor ate 
international sales accounted for approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal the company s net sales to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin 
the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decreases were due primarily to a significant decrease in revenue shipments beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of  which resulted in an underutilization of manufacturing capacity  offset partially by decreased expenses resulting from the resizing of certain areas in operations 
the fiscal decrease was also due in part to inventory write downs taken for obsolete items as a result of the company s introduction of new products and modification and phasing out of older products 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  reflecting increased expenses and lower net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting continued investments in the development of new products  as well as enhancements of existing product lines 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from marketing costs  associated with new product introductions  operating expenses associated with acquisitions made during the year  costs of increasing the company s global infrastructure such as offices in southeast asia  and legal and other expenses for patent litigation that was settled in fiscal and acquisitions 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased over fiscal  due primarily to the reduced net sales 
in process research and development 
during fiscal  the company expensed million of ipr d resulting from the acquisition of certain assets of summit design  inc  and summit s wholly owned subsidiary  test systems strategies  inc the tssi acquisition 
the ipr d associated with the tssi acquisition related to the development of a standard tester interface language stil 
the stil development project is approximately complete as of october  the significant technological hurdles remaining to be addressed include the ability to parse mega vector files and make them immediately available to the application program interface  the ability to effectively process both batch and online input from engineering design automation eda simulation tools  the development of efficient algorithms for taking event data from eda simulation tools and mapping it into the limited resources of a given ate system according to a standard set of rules  and the development of additional stil constructs which enable the use of stil as a design stimulus language  enable the use of stil for representing test patterns for embedded cores  representing the test program flow in stil  representing test methods in stil and defining voltage and current levels associated with stil waveforms 
the company estimates that as of october   the remaining research and development work on the stil project will take approximately engineering person years  at a cost of approximately million and will be completed in fiscal the project has progressed more slowly than originally projected due to lower than anticipated staffing 
the lower staffing levels were a result of the company s actions to reduce expenses during a period of reduced revenues and earnings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the development and successful marketing of any stil based products 
a failure to successfully develop and market stil based products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
interest income 
the company generated interest income of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase was due to interest earned on significantly higher cash and short term investments balances provided by operations and the receipt of proceeds from convertible subordinated notes  offset in part by cash used to increase accounts receivable and inventory as well as for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
interest and other expenses 
interest and other expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the interest expense on the company s convertible subordinated notes 
income tax 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal was lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate in effect for that year  due primarily to the foreign sales corporation benefits 
in fiscal  the company s effective tax rate increased to  primarily due to the recognition of only a portion of the tax benefit associated with the in process research and development charge 
in process research and development amounts are deductible over an extended period of time  and therefore  a valuation allowance was established to offset a portion of the resulting deferred tax asset 
year readiness the year issue results from the use in computer hardware and software of two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
when computer systems must process dates both before and after january   two digit year fields may create processing ambiguities that can cause errors and system failures 
the results of these errors may range from minor undetected errors to the complete shutdown of an affected system 
these errors or failures may have limited effects  or the effects may be widespread  depending on the computer chip  system or software  and its location and function 
the effects of the year problem are exacerbated because of the interdependence of computer and telecommunications systems in the united states and throughout the world 
because of this interdependence  the failure of one system may lead to the failure of many other systems  even though the other systems are themselves year compliant 
the company s board of directors has reviewed the year issue generally and as it may affect the company s business activity 
the company is implementing a year plan the plan which is designed to cover all of the company s activities 
the plan will be modified as circumstances change and is monitored by the company s board of directors 
under the plan  the company is using a five phase methodology for addressing the issue 
the phases are awareness  assessment  renovation  validation and implementation 
the awareness phase consisted of defining the year problem and gaining executive level support and sponsorship for addressing it 
a year program team was established and an overall strategy created 
during the assessment phase  all internal systems  products and supply chain partners were inventoried and prioritized for renovation 
the company believes it has completed a majority of the awareness and assessment phases  however  ongoing work will be required in these areas as the company completes its assessment of existing supply chain partners and enters into new supply chain relationships in the ordinary course of business 
renovation consists of converting  replacing  upgrading or eliminating systems that have year problems 
renovation has begun on mission critical systems and is targeted for completion by march  validation involves ensuring that hardware and software fixes will work properly in and beyond and can occur both before and after implementation 
validation started in late and will continue through june to allow for thorough testing before the year implementation is the installation of year ready hardware and software components in a live environment 
the company is in the early stages of the implementation phase 
the impact of year issues on the company will depend not only on the corrective actions that the company takes  but also on the way in which year issues are addressed by governmental agencies  businesses and other third parties that provide services or data to  or receive services or data from  the company  or whose financial condition or operational capability is important to the company 
to reduce this exposure  the company has an ongoing process of identifying and contacting mission critical third party vendors and other significant third parties to determine their year plans and target dates 
risks associated with any such third parties located outside the united states may be higher insofar as it is generally believed that non us businesses may not be addressing their year issues on as timely a basis as are us businesses 
notwithstanding the company s efforts  there can be no assurance that the company  mission critical third party vendors or other significant third parties will adequately address their year issues 
the company is developing contingency plans in the event that the company  mission critical third party vendors or other significant third parties fail to adequately address year issues 
such plans principally involve identifying alternative vendors or internal remediation 
there can be no assurance that any such plans will fully mitigate any such failures or problems 
furthermore  there may be certain mission critical third parties  such as utilities  telecommunication companies  or material vendors where alternative arrangements or sources are limited or unavailable 
although it is difficult to estimate the total costs of implementing the plan  through june and beyond  the company s preliminary estimate is that such costs will be approximately million 
however  although management believes its estimates are reasonable  there can be no assurance  for the reasons stated in the next paragraph  that the actual costs of implementing the plan will not differ materially from the estimated costs 
the company has incurred costs of approximately  through october   in connection with the plan 
a significant portion of total year project expenses is represented by existing staff that have been redeployed to this project 
the company does not believe that the redeployment of existing staff will have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial position 
incremental expenses related to the year project are not expected to materially impact operating results in any one period 
the extent and magnitude of the year problem as it will affect the company  both before and for some period after january   are difficult to predict or quantify for a number of reasons 
among the most important are lack of control over systems that are used by third parties who are critical to the company s operation  dependence on third party software vendors to deliver year upgrades in a timely manner  complexity of testing inter connected networks and applications that depend on third party networks and the uncertainty surrounding how others will deal with liability issues raised by year related failures 
there can be no assurance  for example  that systems used by third parties will be year ready by january   or by some earlier date  so as not to create a material disruption to the company s business 
moreover  the estimated costs of implementing the plan do not take into account the costs  if any  that might be incurred as a result of year related failures that occur despite the company s implementation of the plan 
although the company is not aware of any material operational issues associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  or material issues with respect to the adequacy of mission critical third party systems  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in such systems or by the company s failure to adequately prepare for the results of such errors or defects  including the costs of related litigation  if any 
the impact of such consequences could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
introduction of the euro the company is currently in the process of assessing the issue raised by the introduction of a single european currency euro introduced on january  while still in the assessment phase  the company does not expect that the introduction and the use of the euro will have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  the company s operations provided million in net cash  primarily as a result of cash generated from the million net loss after reconciling the non cash impact of special charges of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
additionally  the increase in the company s deferred income taxes provided cash of million 
these amounts were partially offset by the use of cash caused by changes in working capital accounts 
the decrease in accounts receivable provided cash of million  primarily as a result of lower fourth quarter sales volumes year over year 
during fiscal  the company purchased product licenses of million  thereby utilizing restricted cash 
the increase in inventories  which utilized cash of million  was due in part to the company s inability to anticipate the drop in demand which occurred during the year  and in part due to purchases of inventories for new products which subsequently did not meet revenue expectations  due primarily to engineering delays 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  which utilized cash of million  was due primarily to the increase of million in prepaid and refundable income taxes  which was caused primarily by the company s net loss 
a decrease in accounts payable  primarily due to reduced purchases of inventories  provided cash of million 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was million 
net purchases of available for sale securities were million 
net acquisitions of property and equipment were million and an additional million of cash was used to purchase other assets 
net cash used in financing activities of million was primarily due the use of million to repurchase the company s common stock  offset partially by issuances of common stock under the company s equity benefit plans totaling million 
as of october   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and available for sale securities  compared with million at october  the company has million available under its unsecured bank line of credit expiring in july at october   there were no amounts outstanding under these agreements 
borrowings are subject to the company s compliance with financial and other covenants 
the company received waivers  effective october   of compliance with certain financial covenants and has subsequently renegotiated the applicable financial covenants under the credit facility 
the company has outstanding debt of million consisting of convertible subordinated notes  due in additionally  as of october   the company has operating leases for facilities and test and other equipment totaling approximately million due through the company expects that its existing cash and investments balances  together with its current or successor line of credit and anticipated cash flow from operations will satisfy its financing requirements for at least the next months 
the company believes that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycles of many of its testers and the new products it has and plans to continue to introduce  investments in inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
significant investments in accounts receivable and inventories subject the company to increased risks  and could continue to materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry has historically been highly cyclical and has experienced downturns  which have had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for automatic test equipment  including equipment manufactured and marketed by the company 
in addition  the automatic test equipment industry is highly competitive  and subject to rapid technological change 
it is reasonably possible that events related to the above factors may occur in the near term which would cause a change to the company s estimate of the net realizable value of receivables  inventories or other assets  and the adequacy of costs accrued for warranty and other liabilities 
such changes could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
the company maintains a strict investment policy which ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the company s investments consist primarily of commercial paper  medium term notes  asset backed securities  us treasury notes and obligations of us government agencies  bank certificates of deposit  auction rate preferred securities  corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
the table below presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s investment portfolio and long term debt obligations in thousands  except percentages 
thereafter cash equivalents fixed rate  average rate restricted cash fixed rate  average rate short term investments fixed rate  average rate long term investments fixed rate  average rate total investment securities   average rate long term debt  fixed rate average rate the company mitigates default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
the company has no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for its million convertible subordinated notes 
the company has a million line of credit under which it can borrow either at the bank s prime rate or as a function of the libor rate 
as of october   the company had no borrowings under its line of credit
