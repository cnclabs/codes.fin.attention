item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dollars in thousands  except average sales prices and per share data the company is the largest provider of death care services in the world 
at december   the company operated  funeral service locations  cemeteries and crematoria located in countries on five continents 
the company conducts funeral operations in all of its business locales  cemetery operations in all regions except france  and financial services operations in north america and france 
as of december   the company s largest markets are north america and france  which when combined  represent approximately of the company s consolidated revenue  of consolidated income from operations and of the company s total operating locations 
the majority of the company s funeral service locations and cemeteries are managed in groups called clusters 
clusters are established primarily in metropolitan areas to take advantage of operational efficiencies  particularly the sharing of operating expenses such as service personnel  vehicles  preparation services  clerical staff and certain building facility costs 
personnel costs  the largest operating expense for the company  is the cost component most beneficially affected by clustering 
the sharing of employees  as well as the other costs mentioned  allows the company to more efficiently utilize its operating facilities due to the traditional fluctuation in the number of funeral services and cemetery interments performed in a given period 
historically  the company s growth has been largely attributable to acquisitions 
in light of prevailing market prices for available acquisition candidates  the company is curtailing its acquisition activity 
additionally  because of the current size of the company  it is becoming increasingly difficult to support the historical earnings growth rate through acquisitions 
therefore  the company intends to focus its efforts on maximizing the profitability of existing clusters of facilities rather than the historically heavy emphasis on acquisitions 
the company  though  will continue to acquire domestic and foreign facilities where operating strategies and pricing considerations are properly aligned 
results of operations fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter funeral and cemetery revenues were  in the fourth quarter  compared to  in the prior year quarter  a increase 
funeral and cemetery gross margins were  in the fourth quarter compared to  in the prior year quarter  a decrease 
the large decrease in the funeral and cemetery gross margins contributed significantly to the consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share declines  quarter over quarter  of and  respectively 
a increase in interest expense  quarter over quarter  was primarily responsible for the remainder of the declines 
though total funeral and cemetery revenues increased quarter over quarter  the rate of growth was less than expected 
at the same time  costs and expenses had been structured for an expected higher level of sales 
major items contributing to the earnings decline included a decline in funeral revenues  quarter over quarter  at locations owned before october  this represented approximately  and was caused by weak death rates and lower average sales prices 
the lower average sales prices were due to a changing profile in the sales mix reflecting an increased proportion of performed funerals from lower average prearranged sales and an increased proportion of lower average cremations 
approximately  or  in additional funeral costs incurred at locations acquired before october  due to higher merchandise  personnel  facility and public relations costs primarily in north america and the united kingdom 
weak operating performances by locations acquired after september  approximately  or  in increased cemetery costs for locations acquired before october  due to higher merchandise  maintenance and administrative expenses primarily in north america 
revenues at these locations grew by approximately  or 
increased overhead costs included in the funeral and cemetery gross margins  partially due to an anticipated higher level of revenues  increased approximately  or 
results of operations the operating results for the company in compared to were below expectations primarily as the result of disappointing fourth quarter funeral and cemetery revenue and a cost structure that was geared toward a higher expected level of revenue 
these issues were discussed above and are discussed in more detail below 
current expectations for the company s outlook point to continued pressure on operating margins as costs are expected to grow at a faster percentage than revenues due primarily to the following issues 
revenue growth is expected to continue to be negatively affected by potentially weak death rates in several of the company s major markets 
in addition  cemetery preneed sales are not expected to grow appreciably over levels due primarily to continued sales staffing difficulties 
the funeral business has a high fixed cost structure approximately of funeral costs that does not easily lend itself to reductions during periods of slower revenue growth 
the acquisition in january of equity corporation international eci  previously the fourth largest death care company in north america  will exert downward pressure on operating margins due to eci s historically lower volume operations

 compared to 
the sales price decrease occurred because of continuing changes in the company s sales mix resulting from a higher proportion of funerals from prearranged contracts being serviced and an increase in the number of cremations performed both of which typically carry lower sales price averages than traditional at need funeral services 
the prearranged sales average has been historically lower than the current at need sales average primarily due to the servicing of older  lower average contracts typically sold by funeral homes that have been acquired by the company 
in addition  the company has lowered sales prices in certain markets for competitive reasons 
locations included in existing clusters  that were acquired since january  performed  funeral services compared to  in  while locations acquired before performed fewer funeral services in  compared to the increasing proportion of people over age in the company s primary north american markets could increase demand for funeral services in the decades to come 
it is believed the company currently performs approximately of the funeral services in north america

recently acquired cemeteries will usually have lower gross margins than the company s existing cemeteries until a formal selling program can be developed and until operating costs can be more efficiently managed through the cluster management approach 
costs at existing cemeteries were

funding required for the company s acquisition program has been generated through public and private offerings of debt and the issuance of equity securities supplemented by the company s revolving credit agreements and additional registered securities 
the company believes cash from operations  additional funds available under its revolving credit agreements  and proceeds from public and private offerings of securities will be sufficient to continue its anticipated acquisition program and policies 
at december   the company had net working capital of  and a current ratio of  compared to working capital of  and a current ratio of at december  the company had a cash and cash equivalents balance at december  of  compared to  at december  approximately   of the december  cash balance was contemplated to be used to repay eci s revolving credit facility and other cash needs

these facilities have financial compliance provisions that contain certain restrictions on levels of net worth  debt  liens and guarantees see note eight to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
sources and uses of cash cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  this increase was primarily due to increases in net income and non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization and deferred taxes  offset by growth in the company s receivables 
the primary source of growth in the company s receivables is from increased sales of cemetery products and merchandise on a preneed basis 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  this increase was primarily due to a  increase in cash used in acquisitions and  of increased capital expenditures including new construction of facilities and major improvements to existing properties

though the level of acquisition activity is expected to slow from the level  the company still believes that the acquisition of funeral and cemetery operations funded with debt or company common stock is a prudent business strategy given the stable cash flow generated and the low failure rate exhibited by these types of businesses 
the company believes these acquired firms are capable of servicing the additional debt and providing a sufficient return on the company s investment 
the company expects adequate sources of funds to be available to finance its future operations and acquisitions through internally generated funds  borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of securities 
at december   the company had approximately  of available borrowings under various revolving credit facilities and lines of credit 
at december   the company had the ability to issue  in securities under a shelf registration 
in addition   shares of common stock and a total of  of guaranteed promissory notes and convertible debentures are registered under a separate shelf registration to be used exclusively for future acquisitions 
prearranged funeral services the company has a marketing program to sell prearranged funeral contracts and the funds collected are generally held in trust or are used to purchase life insurance or annuity contracts 
the amounts paid into trust funds or premiums paid on insurance contracts on such prearranged funeral contracts will be received in cash by a company funeral service location at the time the funeral is performed 
earnings on trust funds and increasing benefits under insurance and annuity funded contracts also increase the amount of cash to be received upon performance of the funeral 
the company has an investment program which entails the ongoing consolidation of multiple trustees  the use of institutional managers with differing investment styles and consolidated performance monitoring and tracking 
this program targets a real return in excess of the amount necessary to cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service as well as any selling costs 
this is accomplished by allocating the portfolio mix to the appropriate investments that more accurately match the anticipated maturity of the contracts 
the company anticipates an asset allocation of approximately equity and fixed income 
the company s north american prearranged trust portfolio earned a return of in and in including realized gains 
marketing costs incurred with the sale of prearranged funeral contracts are a current use of cash which is partially offset with cash retained  pursuant to state laws  from amounts trusted and certain commissions earned by the company for sales of insurance products 
the company sells prearranged funerals in most of its service markets including its major foreign markets 
aml  which was acquired by the company in  has been a provider of insurance and annuity products used to fund company prearranged funerals for several years 
the company s french life insurance subsidiary primarily sells insurance products used to fund prearranged funerals to be performed by the company s french funeral service locations 
prearranged funeral service sales afford the company the opportunity to both protect current market share and mix as well as expand market share in certain markets 
the company believes this will stimulate future revenue growth 
prearranged funeral services fulfilled as a percent of the total north american funerals performed annually approximates in and is expected to grow  thereby making the total number of funerals performed more predictable  which will be recognized as funeral revenues in future periods 
the total value of unperformed prearranged funeral contracts are trust funded or insurance funded and represent the original contract value plus any accumulated trust earnings or increasing insurance benefits 
as of december  and  unperformed prearranged funeral contracts are composed of the following deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues   contracts funded by company owned insurance subsidiaries   the following table summarizes the changes in the total value of unperformed prearranged funeral contracts 
years ended december  beginning balance   net sales   acquisitions dispositions   realized earnings and increasing insurance benefits   maturities   change in cancellation reserve   effect of foreign currency and other   ending balance   the recognition of the total value of unperformed prearranged funeral revenues is estimated to occur in the following years 
through  and thereafter  cremations in recent years there has been steady  gradual growth in the number of cremations that have been chosen as an alternative to traditional methods of disposal of human remains 
in  in of all families served by the company s north american funeral service locations selected the cremation alternative  substantially more than the national average according to industry studies 
the company has a significant number of operating locations in florida and the west coast of north america where the cremation alternative continues to gain acceptance 
based on industry studies  the company believes that cremations account for approximately of all dispositions of human remains in australia and the united kingdom 
it is estimated that cremations account for approximately of all dispositions of human remains in france 
though a cremation typically results in fewer sales dollars than a traditional funeral service  the company believes that funeral operations which are predominantly cremation businesses typically have higher gross profit margin percentages than those exhibited at traditional funeral operations 
cremation memorialization has long been a tradition in the australian and united kingdom markets 
the company has expanded its product alternatives in these markets which has resulted in higher average sales 
the company has also established markets in select areas within north america and believes that memorialization of cremated remains represents a source of revenue and margin growth 
other matters in january   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company acquired eci in a stock for stock transaction valued at approximately  with assumed debt of  eci owned funeral homes and cemeteries in north america 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives will be recorded either in earnings or in other comprehensive income  based on the type of risk for which the instrument is determined to be an effective hedge 
any change in fair value of an instrument that is not designated as a hedge  or any portion of a change in fair value of a hedging instrument that is deemed ineffective  will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company expects to adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal year and is currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements 
several countries in which the company operates will adopt usage of the euro in the euro is a common currency being adopted by many of the countries within the european community 
the company has established plans to address operational and information system issues related to the euro conversion 
the company does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company intends to repurchase the floating rate notes  due and putable in  in the amount of  this debt instrument is expected to be refinanced under the company s commercial paper program before april  as of march   the company estimates this repurchase will result in an extraordinary charge of approximately  in  net of tax 
in association with the review and analysis of its operating cost structure  the company anticipates recording a special charge to earnings in the quarter ended march  items being considered are severance for employee terminations  lease costs and asset write offs for various offices and operations to be closed  and costs related to construction projects that will not be completed 
the amount of the charge is expected to be between  and  on a pre tax basis 
since january   several lawsuits have been commenced on behalf of persons who i acquired shares of company common stock in the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company into eci  ii purchased shares of company common stock during certain specified class periods or iii owned employee stock options in eci 
as of march   class action lawsuits that had been originally filed in federal district court in houston had been consolidated into one action pending in that court  and one additional class action lawsuit that had been originally filed in the federal district court in lufkin  texas was still pending in that court 
these lawsuits allege violations of federal securities laws and name as defendants the company and certain of its officers and directors 
as of the same date  two former state court lawsuits  one of which was a class action  naming the company as defendant and alleging fraud and violations of texas securities and common law had been removed to the federal district court in lufkin 
the lawsuits generally refer to the company s january  public announcement that the company s diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of and for the year ended december  would be lower than analyst expectations 
the lawsuits seek  among other things  to recover unspecified damages 
since the litigation is in its very preliminary stages  no discovery has been taken  and the company cannot quantify its ultimate liability  if any  for the payment of damages in these lawsuits 
however  the company believes that the allegations in the lawsuits do not provide a basis for the recovery of damages because the company has made all the required disclosures on a timely basis 
the company is seeking to transfer the lawsuits pending in lufkin and consolidate them with the action pending in federal district court in houston 
the company intends to aggressively defend the foregoing litigation 
year issue the year issue  also known as yk  refers to the inability of some computer programs and computer based microprocessors to correctly interpret the century from a date in which the year is represented by only two digits eg  
as a result  on or before january   computer systems used by companies throughout the world may experience operating difficulties unless they are modified or upgraded to properly process date related information 
the yk issue can arise at any point in a company s supply  manufacturing  processing  distribution  or financial chains 
the company has established yk program offices at its corporate offices in houston  texas and birmingham  england 
these program offices  under the direction of senior management  are responsible for advising and monitoring the numerous facets of the company s yk preparations 
the company has engaged an external consulting firm to assist in oversight of the company s yk preparations and various assessment activities associated with discovering the seriousness of the yk issue in the pacific rim and south america 
additionally  the company is utilizing internal personnel  contract project managers  programmers and testers  as well as vendors  to identify yk issues  test and implement the chosen solutions 
in order to adequately address the yk issue  efforts have been directed to the following categories production systems  networks  desktops  user developed applications  vendor supplied software  facilities and telecommunications  and the company s supply chain 
the following phases are common to all of these categories inventory and determination of criticality  discovery to determine yk problems  analysis to determine corrective action  correction  testing  and implementation 
in addition to these activities  promotion of yk awareness and development of contingency plans are part of the company s yk preparation effort 
state of readiness the majority of the company s internal yk exposure exists at the corporate office locations where the accounting and processing of the company s business transactions takes place 
individual operating locations primarily funeral homes and cemeteries are substantially technology independent and thus face few yk risks from internal systems 
production systems in  in order to improve access to business information through a common  integrated computing system across the company  the company began a worldwide computer systems replacement project utilizing systems from oracle corporation oracle 
while this project has begun at the company s australian and european headquarters  global implementation will not be achieved prior to the turn of the century 
therefore  all computer programs expected to be replaced by oracle are being made yk ready 
the only exception to this is in the united kingdom where the implementation of oracle is proceeding in order to achieve yk readiness 
in general  the company s production systems have progressed through the inventory  discovery  and analysis phases and are in various stages of correction and testing 
production systems make up the majority of the company s mission critical systems and are expected to be yk ready by mid  with deployment completed by late in many cases  deployment of the yk ready production systems to the company s many operating locations in north america will require new desktop computers 
at this point  it is the short time available for deployment  and not the need for corrective action  that poses the largest risk to the company 
see the section on risks for more details 
networks inventory  discovery and analysis of critical networks have been completed at all of the company s headquarter and regional locations and these networks are in various stages of correction and testing 
accomplishing yk readiness in this category has been complicated by microsoft s recent change in its position on the yk readiness of windows nt  requiring customers to install another software update to be considered fully yk compliant 
some non critical networks exist at individual operating locations and will be assessed and made yk ready as time allows 
expectations are that all critical networks will be yk ready by mid desktops testing has been conducted to determine the extent to which the yk problem associated with desktops will affect the company s ability to conduct business 
as none of the company s critical computer systems directly access date information from the desktop s real time clock  it has been determined that very few desktops will pose a yk issue 
coincidentally  as part of ongoing technology refresh programs and new production systems deployment  desktops are being upgraded  as needed  to better meet the company s business needs 
as part of contingency planning  personnel will be instructed on how to verify each desktop s date  and reset if necessary  after january  user developed applications inventory and discovery for items in this category have been achieved 
very few critical applications were found to have date dependencies 
those that do are being remediated and tested to ensure no problems arise because of yk issues 
readiness should be achieved by mid vendor supplied software it is the policy of the company to query each manufacturer of critical off the shelf software to ascertain the vendor s statement regarding the yk readiness of their products 
once the vendor s statement is obtained  upgrades  replacements and testing will be implemented to minimize the risk of yk issues arising from the software 
accomplishing yk readiness in this category is becoming increasingly challenging as vendors are modifying previously stated positions on existing software  requiring customers to install patches or upgrades to achieve full yk readiness 
this has occurred with at least three critical vendor supplied software packages the company currently uses 
given the moving target posed by the vendor s changing statements  the company has changed its expectations for critical items in this category and plans to be using the latest vendor supplied patches and upgrades by late facilities and telecommunications the company recognizes the potential for yk issues to arise from embedded technology systems which may be in use at its numerous facilities 
inventory  discovery and analysis are complete at the company s headquarters and most international operating locations 
north american operating locations are expected to complete these phases by mid telecommunications equipment has proven the most vulnerable  and plans are in place to upgrade and or replace equipment as necessary 
planning has begun to obtain inventories from the remaining operating locations 
all critical facilities and telecommunication systems are expected to be yk ready by late supply chain due to the company s disparate locations and methods of operation  assessing the yk readiness of the company s supply chain must occur at both the corporate level for core supply chain relationships and the local level for those relationships unique to a location 
inventory and discovery have been completed at a number of operating locations and is ongoing at the company s headquarters 
in general  responses to the company s inquiries have been less than informative  with many companies failing to respond 
planning has begun to assign criticality to both corporate and local supply relationships and additional efforts will be expended to ascertain the yk readiness of critical suppliers 
contingency plans for critical suppliers are expected to be in place by late costs the aggregate costs for the company to achieve yk readiness are not expected to exceed  of which  represents lease payments which will be incurred from the  reduction from the september  estimate is primarily due to lower than anticipated yk issues in embedded technology systems 
all costs associated with yk readiness will be funded from operating cash flows 
the company s actual costs incurred associated with yk readiness through december  are estimated at  in an effort to report material costs related to the company s yk effort  the company has adopted a policy of capturing all costs of one thousand dollars or more  all contractor expenses  and internal costs for dedicated resources those working exclusively on yk issues 
as such the company acknowledges that there are many internal resources working part time on yk related issues for which no payroll or overhead costs are being reported 
risks the majority of the company s internal yk exposure exists at its corporate offices where the company s production systems operate 
the failure to correct a material yk problem at these locations could result in an interruption of certain normal corporate business activities 
such a failure would not  however  render the company s various operating locations unable to deliver goods and services 
the company believes that the greatest risks continue to arise from the uncertainty of the yk readiness of critical third party suppliers  both private businesses and government entities  especially in the company s international markets 
the possible consequences of critical third party suppliers not being yk ready by january  could include temporary location closings  delays in the delivery of goods and services  delays in the receipt of goods and invoice and collection errors 
continued efforts by the company to ascertain the yk status of critical third party suppliers is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty as the year approaches and  through the use of contingency planning  the possibility of significant interruptions in normal operations should be reduced 
at this time  the company has no substantiated reason to believe that one or more key third party suppliers will not be able to meet their obligations to the company after january   therefore  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would occur if deployment of the company s newly remediated proprietary funeral home financial system to all north american locations was not completed by december  such an occurrence would not be materially disruptive to the company 
contingencies for this include modifying deployment schedules in late to ensure at least one location is installed in each cluster and forwarding all transactions to be input to the new system 
contingency plans because of the many uncertainties that exist  it is part of the company s yk preparation methodology that contingency plans be established for critical systems in each of the categories outlined above 
contingency planning is progressing at different stages at the company s various locations 
contingency plans for all critical production systems and plans for all individual operating locations are expected to be in place by late quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes nine and ten to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses derivatives primarily in the form of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in combination with local currency borrowings in order to manage its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to substantially hedge the company s net investment in foreign assets 
the derivative instruments held by the company are for hedging purposes and are neither leveraged nor speculative in nature 
the company expects no material change in these policies in the coming year 
movements in currency rates that impact the swaps are generally offset by a corresponding movement in the value of the underlying assets being hedged 
movements in interest rates that impact the fair value of the interest rate swaps are generally offset by a corresponding movement in the value of the underlying debt being hedged 
similarly  currency movements that impact foreign interest expense due under the cross currency interest rate swaps are generally offset by a corresponding movement in the earnings of the foreign operation 
at december   after giving effect to the interest rate swaps  the company s total debt consists of approximately of fixed interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of and approximately of floating interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
at december   the company s total debt consisted of approximately of fixed interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of and approximately of floating interest rate debt at a weighted average rate of 
the company s overall sensitivity to floating interest rates is diversified in that approximately of the company s floating rate exposure  as of december   is based in eight markets other than the united states 
in general  the company hedges up to of its net investment in foreign assets when such investment is considered significant and when it is reasonably cost efficient to do so 
approximately of the company s net investment and of its operating income are denominated in foreign currencies 
due to the cross currency hedges described above  approximately of the company s net assets and approximately of the company s operating earnings are subject to translation risk 
marketable equity and debt securities price risk in connection with insurance operations  prearranged funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise sales  the company owns investments in equity securities and mutual funds which are sensitive to current market prices 
cost and market values as of december  and  are presented in notes four  five and six to the consolidated financial statements 
market rate sensitive instruments interest rate and currency risk the company s financial instruments that are subject to interest rate and currency risk consist of debt instruments  us dollar interest rate swaps  and cross currency interest rate swaps 
the company performs sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of these risks on earnings 
this analysis reflects the impact of a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
in actuality  market rate volatility is dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast 
therefore  adverse changes described below could differ substantially from the hypothetical impact 
the analysis conducted below does not include provident assets or those of the insurance subsidiary 
instead  these are referenced separately in tabular format below 
a sensitivity analysis of those instruments with variable interest rate components is modeled to assess the impact that changing interest rates could have on pre tax earnings 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous adverse change to the then prevailing interest rates with all other variables held constant 
given this model  the company s pre tax earnings  on an annual basis  would be negatively impacted by  on december   and  on december  a similar model is used to assess the impact of changes in foreign currencies on interest expense 
the company s debt and derivative exposure is primarily associated with the french franc  british pound  canadian dollar  australian dollar  spanish peseta  and the norwegian krone 
a adverse change in the us dollar against these currencies would have negatively impacted the company s pre tax earnings  on an annual basis  by  on december  and  on december  for certain assets  the tables below present principal cash flows that exist by maturity date and the related average interest rates as of december  fair value thereafter asset liability provident receivables        average rate insurance subsidiaries investments in debt securities        average rate as of december  fair value thereafter asset liability provident receivables        average rate insurance subsidiaries investments in debt securities        average rate the unrealized gain on debt securities principally reflects changes in interest rates 
to reduce exposure to interest rate changes  portfolio investments are selected so the weighted average duration of the investments approximates the duration of associated policyholder liabilities 
the insurance companies are subject to reinvestment risk upon either sale or maturity of the debt securities 
management believes that absence of any material amounts of high yield or non investment grade investments in the portfolios of its insurance subsidiaries enhances the ability of the insurance companies to provide security to their policyholders
