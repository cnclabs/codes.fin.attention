item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as used in this document  the terms the company  we and us include both vdc and vdc bermuda 
the use of these terms reflects the fact that through november   the publicly held company was vdc bermuda 
thereafter  due to the domestication merger  the publicly held company was vdc 
we own telecommunications equipment and lease telecommunications lines to provide domestic and international long distance telecommunications services 
in addition  we connect to other telephone companies and resell their services to destinations where we do not own equipment or lease lines 
our customers are other long distance telephone companies that resell our services to their retail customers or other telecommunications companies 
in the future  we anticipate offering our services directly to retail customers in addition to our current wholesale customers 
we currently employ state of the art digital switching and transmission technology 
this equipment  located in new york  los angeles  and denver comprises our operating facilities 
our facilities and industry agreements allow us to provide voice and facsimile telecommunications services to most countries in the world 
we believe the telecommunications industry is attractive given its current size and future growth potential 
furthermore  we believe the international telecommunications market provides greater opportunity for growth than the domestic market  due to the relatively limited capacity in certain markets and potentially greater gross margin per minute of traffic 
our objective is to become an international telecommunications company with strategic assets and transmission capability in many attractive markets worldwide 
management believes that in order to achieve this goal  we must provide our customers with long distance and international voice and facsimile transmission at competitive prices 
we strive to provide competitive rates  while maintaining carrier grade toll quality to destinations worldwide 
we believe that our current facilities are sufficient to handle significantly more traffic than we are currently experiencing 
in order to make better use of this capacity  we need to build a reputation for high quality transmission within our industry and provide competitive pricing 
current results reflect the fact that we have been a company in transition 
we began the development of our long distance telecommunications business on march  and have since developed our infrastructure and industry relations 
during these pre operating phases we focused upon fund raising  developing a strategic business plan  purchasing telecommunications switches  developing corporate infrastructure  and developing and commencing marketing programs 
effectively  operations began when our telecommunications network was activated and our marketing efforts commenced in january since then we have had modest success generating traffic over our infrastructure 
during the past year  we have made significant advancements in our strategic business plan 
some of the more important events in our short history include listed on the american stock exchange in july  completed domestication merger in november  thereby domesticating the publicly held company in delaware  united states  added three members to the board of directors  all of whom were previously independent of the company  completed initial facilities and network development  started marketing world wide network january   raised additional funds of approximately million  wrote down investment in metromedia china corporation  and revenues increased from an approximate run rate of  month at mid fiscal year to an approximate run rate of  month at fiscal year end 
while we also made significant inroads in the telecommunications business in central america in the past year  during the quarter ended june   we cancelled our circuit into central america and curtailed the operations of our masatepe subsidiary 
the practical effect of this cancellation is that masatepe no longer operates its owned telecommunications route to central america 
it is possible that masatepe may develop other routes or restart its central american route 
we are currently terminating a similar volume of traffic in central america through the use of our international network 
moreover  additional opportunities in central america are currently being explored through voice data communications latin america  inc  a subsidiary of the company 
we earn revenue from three sources 
the main source is from our domestic and international telecommunications long distance services which is earned based on the number of minutes billable to our customers  which are other telephone companies 
these minutes are generally billed on a monthly basis 
bills are generally paid within thirty days 
our second source of revenues is derived from the rental of telecommunications equipment at our telecommunications facilities and telecommunications circuits to other telephone companies 
this revenue is generated and billed on a month to month basis 
wholesale telecommunications services such as long distance  international long distance  and switching equipment and capacity rental represented approximately of our revenues during the year ended june  fiscal 
additionally  we derive minimal revenues from the management of domestic tower sites that provide transmission and receiver locations for wireless communications companies 
this revenue is also generated and billed on a month to month basis 
revenue from site tower management represents approximately of our total revenues during fiscal revenue derived through the per minute transmission of voice and facsimile is normally in accordance with contracts with other telecommunications companies 
these contracts are often for a year or more  but can generally be amended with a few days notice 
costs of services include terminating domestic long distance traffic in the united states  terminating overseas originated traffic in the united states and internationally  and terminating domestic originated  international traffic outside the united states 
we use other telecommunications companies services in the same manner that they use ours 
therefore  our costs include significant payments to other telecommunications companies  including variable per minute costs for them to provide voice and facsimile services to us  which we resell to our customers 
in addition  our costs of services include fixed monthly expenses for capacity on a fiber optic backbone across the united states  the allocable personnel and overhead associated with operations  and  depreciation of telecommunications equipment 
we depreciate long distance telecommunications over a period of five years 
our costs also include selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a consists primarily of personnel costs  professional fees  travel  office rental and business development related costs 
we incur costs on a regular basis associated with international market research and due diligence regarding potential projects inside and outside of the us we believe that our recurring sg a costs will begin to level off as we reach a mature operating level 
it is  however  possible that sg a could increase significantly 
we believe that over time  we may build our volume of minutes billed so that our revenues surpass our costs 
we believe that the majority of the infrastructure and personnel necessary to achieve this are currently in place 
background vdc communications  inc vdc is the successor to its former parent  vdc bermuda  by virtue of the domestication merger that occurred on november  the effect of the domestication merger was that members stockholders of vdc bermuda became stockholders of vdc 
the primary reason for the domestication merger was to reorganize vdc bermuda as a publicly traded united states corporation domesticated in the state of delaware 
in connection with the domestication merger   issued and outstanding shares of common stock of vdc bermuda  par value per share  were exchanged  and  issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock of vdc  
par value per share  were converted  on a one for one basis  into an aggregate  shares of common stock of vdc 
the domestication merger has been accounted for as a reorganization which has been given retroactive effect in the financial statements for all periods presented 
the domestication merger reflects the completion of a series of transactions that commenced on march   when vdc then a wholly owned subsidiary of vdc bermuda acquired sky king communications  inc sky king connecticut by merger 
this merger transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby sky king connecticut was treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes 
accordingly  the historical financial statements presented are those of sky king connecticut before the merger on march  and reflect the consolidated results of sky king connecticut and vdc bermuda  and other wholly owned subsidiaries after the march  merger 
the sky king connecticut acquisition enabled vdc bermuda to enter into the telecommunications business and reflected the culmination of an overall business reorganization in which vdc bermuda curtailed its prior lines of business 
from its inception in through  the principal business of vdc bermuda had involved the acquisition and exploration of north american mineral resource properties 
in recognition  however  of the decreasing mineral prices and increasing drilling and exploration costs  during the early s  it elected to phase out of the mining business  and  by  effectively suspended any further efforts in connection with its former mining business 
following a brief period in which it owned farm and ranch properties  the principal business of vdc bermuda through consisted of the acquisition and development of commercial properties in and around the isle of man  british isles  where the executive offices of vdc bermuda were located at that time 
in view  however  of unanticipated development costs and delays in zoning approvals  among others  management thereafter concluded that vdc bermuda would be unable to complete the development of these properties in the manner originally intended 
with returns on investment likely to be below management s expectations  during and  vdc bermuda commenced the sale of its real estate holdings  while attempting to devise plans for the redeployment of its capital resources 
finally  during the year ended june  fiscal  vdc bermuda made equity investments in an aggregate amount of approximately million in two early stage ventures 
when expected yields from these investments failed to materialize  management concluded that it was in the best interest of vdc bermuda to i suspend its venture capital operations  ii dispose of its investment assets  and iii select new management who would be in a better position to identify business opportunities that would more fully benefit from vdc bermuda s attributes as a public corporation 
during the remainder of fiscal  management reviewed several possibilities and ultimately identified sky king connecticut for acquisition in recognition of a number of factors  including its belief in the growth opportunities available within the national and international telecommunications industries  and the significant collective experiences of the sky king connecticut s management within the telecommunications industry 
results of operations for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenues total revenues in the year ended june  fiscal increased to approximately million from approximately  for the year ended june  fiscal or corresponding prior year period 
this is the initial result of the implementation of our telecommunications services 
during fiscal  our international network for telecommunications services became operational and commercial 
during the latter months of fiscal  we experienced a steady increase in minutes of usage of telecommunications services as customers came on line and began utilizing our services 
revenues were generated during the period by the transmission of minutes domestically and internationally  the rental of telecommunications facilities  and tower management 
revenue for the corresponding prior year period was attributable to tower management and consulting 
costs of services costs of services of approximately million during fiscal were the result of a combination of per minute fees and leased line fees associated with the traffic carried in the period  salaries  depreciation of telecommunications equipment  and other operating expenses 
costs of services of approximately  for the corresponding prior year period reflected site leasing expenses 
selling  general administrative sg a expenses increased to approximately million during fiscal from approximately million for the corresponding prior year period 
this increase was attributable to an overall increase in operational and corporate activity  including salaries and development costs necessary for the development and operation of new telecommunications services  including our telecommunications infrastructure  professional fees  including consulting  legal and accounting expenses associated with the redeployment of our assets  amortization of approximately  associated with the acquisition of masatepe  and non recurring items one time write off related to the purchase of a telecommunications route of  and non cash severance expense totaling  had the non recurring items not occurred during the period  sg a expenses would have been approximately million for fiscal we believe that our recurring sg a costs will begin to level off as we reach a mature operating level 
it is  however  possible that as new opportunities  or as mergers and acquisitions are completed  or if we fail to accurately estimate future expenses  sg a could increase significantly 
non cash compensation expense non cash compensation expense was  for fiscal compared to  for the corresponding prior year period 
during fiscal  million shares of vdc s series b convertible preferred stock escrow shares  were released from escrow based upon the achievement of performance criteria which includes the deployment of telecommunications equipment in service areas with an aggregate population of greater than million 
of the million escrow shares released  million were considered compensatory for accounting purposes 
these compensatory shares were owned by management  their family trusts  minor children of management and an employee 
the shares issued to former sky king connecticut shareholders minor children were considered compensatory because their beneficial ownership was attributed to certain sky king connecticut shareholders in management positions with the company 
the non cash expense reflected on our financial statements was developed based on the deemed value of the shares released from escrow  which in turn  was based on the trading price of vdc s common stock on the date of release 
during fiscal   shares of series b convertible preferred stock were released from escrow based upon the achievement of performance criteria which included the procurement of million in equity financing 
of the  shares of series b convertible preferred stock released from escrow   were considered compensatory for accounting purposes 
these compensatory shares were owned by management  their family trusts  minor children of management  and an employee 
the non cash compensation expense reflected on our financial statements is an accounting charge which was developed based on the deemed value of the shares released from escrow  which in turn  was based on the trading price of vdc bermuda s common stock on the date of release 
asset impairment charges we incurred approximately million in asset impairment charges during fiscal these charges relate to the write off of billing software  the write off of fixed assets  in nicaragua and write off of goodwill  related to the masatepe subsidiary 
the acquisition of masatepe was made primarily because of the continued relationship masatepe s affiliate  masatepe comunicaciones  sa masacom  had with enitel  the nicaraguan government controlled telecommunications company 
disagreements over business development arose between masatepe and masacom 
as a result  we cancelled our circuit into central america and curtailed masatepe s operations 
masatepe no longer operates its owned telecommunications route to central america 
therefore  we believe that the goodwill attributable to the masatepe acquisition has been permanently impaired 
there were no asset impairment charges in fiscal other income expense other income expense was approximately million for fiscal compared with approximately  for the corresponding prior year period 
the other expense was mostly due to a non cash charge of million attributable to a writedown of our ownership interest in mcc and a million loss on restructuring of notes receivable during fiscal other income during fiscal was attributable to interest and dividend income 
see liquidity and capital resources 
net loss our net loss for fiscal was approximately million 
the net loss was primarily the result of non cash charges  separate and apart from our ongoing core operations 
the write down of our investment in mcc accounted for approximately million of the loss 
non cash compensation accounted for an additional million of the loss 
these items did not affect our liquidity 
on an operating cash basis  we experienced a loss of approximately million during fiscal losses on an operating cash basis represent cash flows from operations excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our net loss for the corresponding prior year period was approximately million 
the fiscal net loss was mostly attributable to a non cash compensation charge and sg a expenses 
on an operating cash basis  we experienced a loss of approximately million during fiscal we expect that future profitability is likely to depend upon a combination of several factors the continued increase in the market for international telecommunications services  the anticipated increase in the competitiveness of our product  and management of growth 
there are many other factors that could also have an impact 
for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  revenues total revenues increased to approximately  in fiscal as compared to approximately  for year ended june  fiscal 
the increase reflects increased sites under management and consulting fees 
we no longer act as a consultant to other telecommunications companies 
costs of services costs of services during fiscal and fiscal consisted of site leasing expense 
site leasing expense increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in radio tower and antenna space rentals 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to professional fees  including consulting  legal and accounting expenses associated with the redeployment of our assets and salaries of new personnel necessary for our development of new telecommunications services 
non cash compensation expense non cash compensation expense was  in fiscal up from in fiscal during fiscal   shares of series b convertible preferred stock were released from escrow based upon the achievement of performance criteria which included the procurement of million in equity financing 
of the  shares of series b convertible preferred stock released   were considered compensatory 
these compensatory shares were owned by management  their family trusts  minor children  and an employee 
the shares issued to former sky king connecticut shareholders minor children were considered compensatory because their beneficial ownership was attributed to certain sky king connecticut shareholders 
the non cash expense reflected on our financial statements is an accounting charge which was developed based on the deemed value of the shares released from escrow  which in turn  was based on the trading price of the company s common stock on the date of release 
liquidity and capital resources our auditors have raised the issue that we may not be able to continue as a going concern as a result of a lack of profits 
a significant amount of capital has been expended towards building corporate infrastructure and operating and capital expenditures in connection with certain acquisitions and the establishment of our programs 
these expenditures have been incurred in advance of the realization of revenue that may occur as a result of such programs 
as a result  our liquidity and capital resources have diminished significantly 
liquidity and capital resources could improve within the short term by a combination of any one or more of the following factors i an increase in revenues and gross profit from operations  and ii financing activities 
an inability to generate cash from either of these factors within the short term could adversely affect our operations and plans for future growth 
if these issues are not addressed  we may have to materially reduce the size and scope of our overhead and planned operations 
in september  frederick a 
moran  a director and officer of the company  transferred personal funds totaling  to the company 
this amount represents a short term loan to be repaid by the company in accordance with the terms of a promissory note executed by the company on september  the promissory note is due on september  and provides for an interest rate of eight percent per annum 
for our most recent quarter  we lost approximately  per month on an operating cash basis 
based on ongoing cost cutting and related efforts  we anticipate that we will lose between approximately  and  per month on an operating cash basis in the short term 
if we are unable to supplement our operations with outside funding  our operations may have to be modified and our business may be in jeopardy of bankruptcy 
we are exploring financing and other alternatives and are developing our operations in order to increase our liquidity and capital resources 
some of our potential financing alternatives and operational developments include i a loan using our telecommunications equipment as collateral  ii equity financing  iii an increase in revenues and gross profit through the initiation of services for new customers and or increases in capacity available to existing customers  iv we are attempting to develop direct telecommunications routes which  once operational  could help liquidity by increasing revenues and gross profit  and v reducing sg a and or other cost cutting measures 
there are no assurances  however  that any of these different possibilities  which could positively impact liquidity  will occur 
we are currently contemplating capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal the capital expenditures represent telecommunications equipment that could potentially be located in foreign countries 
our expected sources of funds include debt and or equity fund raising and cash flow from operations 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for fiscal we collected approximately million from customers while paying approximately million to capital equipment vendors  carriers and other vendors and employees 
net cash used by operating activities of approximately million for the year ended june  was mostly due to the net loss from operations net of a non cash compensation charge 
net cash used of  for the year ended june  was mostly due to the net loss 
net cash used by investing activities was approximately million for fiscal cash was used for capital expenditures on facilities and switching equipment  the purchase of masatepe as well as investing in and or lending funds to masatepe s nicaraguan owned subsidiary  masacom 
cash flows from investing activities included the collection of notes receivable and the return of escrow funds in connection with the investment in mcc 
net cash used by investing activities was approximately million for the year ended june  this was primarily the result of the investment in mcc  fixed asset acquisitions and deposits on the purchase of fixed assets offset by the collection of notes receivable 
there were no cash flows from investing activities for the year ended june  cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for fiscal this reflects proceeds primarily from the issuance of  shares of vdc common stock  including  shares of vdc common stock to frederick a 
moran  chairman and chief executive officer of the company  and certain entities associated with and family members of mr 
moran  the collection of stock subscriptions receivable  and proceeds from the issuance of short term debt less repayments of debt and capital lease obligations 
the funds were used mostly for working capital and capital expenditures 
proceeds provided by financing activities of approximately million for fiscal were solely from the issuance of common stock and were used to fund operations and capital expenses 
fiscal proceeds reflect capital contributions by the owners of sky king connecticut and were used to fund operations 
we are currently funding operations through existing cash and accounts receivable collections 
we do not know how long it will take before we will be able to operate profitably and  therefore  sustain our business without outside funding 
we have recently entered into investment banking agreements to explore financing and strategic alternatives 
we expect to continue to explore acquisition opportunities 
such acquisitions may have a significant impact on our need for capital 
in the event of a need for capital in connection with an acquisition  we would explore a range of financing options  which could include public or private debt  or equity financing 
there can be no assurances that such financing will be available  or if available  will be available on favorable terms 
we will also consider acquisitions using our common stock 
investment in mcc we own million shares and warrants to purchase million shares of mcc  a private telecommunications company 
we have held this asset for over one year 
we originally valued the asset based on the value of our shares and cash exchanged for the investment 
our current financial position does not allow us to exercise the warrants without the liquidity of a public market for mcc stock 
therefore  in performing a review for current recoverability of our investment  we have not attributed a value to the warrants 
mcc operates joint ventures in china 
metromedia international group mmg is the majority owner of mcc 
currently  legal restrictions in china prohibit foreign ownership and operations in the telecommunications sector 
mcc s investments in joint ventures have been made through a structure known as sino sino foreign ssf joint venture 
this is a widely used method for foreign investment in the chinese telecommunications industry 
the ssf venturer  in this case mcc  is a provider of telecommunications equipment  financing and technical services to telecommunications operators and not a direct provider of telephony service 
the joint ventures invest in telecommunications system construction and development networks being undertaken by the local partner  china unicom 
the completed systems are operated by china unicom 
mcc receives payments from china unicom based on revenues and profits generated by the systems in return for their providing financing  technical advice  consulting and other services 
based on mmg s form q for its quarter ended june  june q  two of the four joint ventures the one ningbo ya mei telecommunications co  ltd 
and the other ningbo ya lian telecommunications co  ltd 
were notified by china unicom that the supervisory department of the chinese government had requested that china unicom terminate the projects 
the notification requested that negotiations begin immediately regarding the amounts to be paid to the joint ventures  including return of investment made and appropriate compensation and other matters related to winding up the ningbo joint ventures activities as a result of this notice 
negotiations regarding the termination have begun 
the content of the negotiations includes determining the investment principal of the joint ventures  appropriate compensation and other matters related to termination of contracts 
mcc cannot currently determine the amount of compensation the joint ventures will receive 
while mcc has not received notification regarding the termination of its other two joint ventures the one sichuan tai li feng telecommunications co  ltd 
and the other chongqing tai le feng telecommunications co  ltd  the majority owner  mmg  expects that these will also be the subject of project termination negotiations 
mmg has disclosed in its june q that depending on the amount of compensation it receives  it will record a non cash charge equal to the difference between the sum of the carrying values of its investment and advances made to joint ventures plus goodwill less the cash compensation it receives from the joint ventures which china unicom has paid 
mmg has represented to us that it owns approximately million mcc shares  or million million shares 
as such  our million shares represents approximately a interest million million shares 
prior to the project termination agreements  there had been uncertainty regarding possible significant changes in the regulation of and policy concerning foreign participation in and financing of the telecommunications industry in china  including the continued viability of the ssf structure and associated service and consulting arrangements with china unicom 
as a result  we recorded a  writedown of the investment in mcc during the quarter ended march  the write down adjusted the carrying value of the investment in mcc to an amount relative to mmg s carrying amount 
due to the recent announcement of the project terminations described above  we recorded an additional  writedown of the investment in mcc 
the write down adjusted the carrying value of the investment in mcc to an amount relative to mmg s carrying amount  excluding mmg s goodwill attributable to the investment in mcc 
as such  we adjusted the carrying value of our investment in mcc to million million x at june  given the uncertainty regarding the outcome of the negotiations of the project terminations  it is reasonably possible that our investment in mcc could be reduced further in the near term 
recent accounting standards in june  the aicpa issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we have not yet analyzed the impact of this new standard 
we will adopt this standard in july of the year readiness disclosure we are currently evaluating the year readiness of our computer systems  software applications and telecommunications equipment 
we are sending year compliance inquiries to certain third parties ie vendors  customers  outside contractors with whom we have a relationship 
these inquiries include  among other things  requests to provide documentation regarding the third party s year programs  and questions regarding how the third party specifically examined the year effect on their computers and what remedial actions will be taken with regard to these problems 
our key processing systems have recently been implemented 
most of the vendors of such systems have represented to us that their systems are compliant with the year issues without any modification 
we will  however  continue to require confirmation of year compliance in our future requests for proposals from equipment and software vendors 
the failure of our computer systems and software applications to accommodate year issues  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and result of operations 
further  if the networks and systems of those on whose services we depend and with whom our networks and systems must interface are not year functional  it could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our networks and  as a result  have a material adverse effect on us 
most major domestic carriers have announced that they expect all of their network and support systems to be year functional by the middle of however  other domestic and international carriers may not be year functional 
we intend to continue to monitor the performance of our accounting  information and processing systems and software applications and those of our third party constituents to identify and resolve any year issues 
currently  through our discovery process  we have identified and remedied  worth of expenditures associated with updating our systems to be compliant with the year however  we expect to find additional expenses pending the finalization of our year investigation 
we have not made an estimate of what those additional expenditures might be 
although  we do expect they will be less than the initial  we believe there is significant risk in that carriers in other countries with whom we may do business may not be year compliant  possibly having an adverse impact upon our ability to transmit or terminate telecom traffic and therefore  a material adverse effect on business financial condition and results 
we believe that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario resulting from the century change could be the inability to route telecommunications traffic at current rates to desired locations for an indeterminable period of time  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
we do not have a completed contingency plan 
however  in order to handle our perceived worst case scenario  we believe we would have to test alternative routing options and possibly re route significant amounts of telecommunications traffic 
re routing to certain destinations may not be readily available 
we anticipate having our year compliance procedures completed prior to the end of calendar item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations since our capital lease obligations are at fixed rates 
the only debt we currently have is in the form of long term equipment leases 
we may be exposed to interest rate risk  as additional financing may be required due to the operating losses and capital expenditures associated with establishing and expanding our facilities 
the interest rate that we will be able to obtain on additional financing will depend on market conditions at that time  and may differ from the rates we have secured on our current debt 
we do not currently anticipate entering into interest rate swap and or similar instruments 
our carrying value of cash and cash equivalents  accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable  marketable securities available for sale  and notes payable is a reasonable approximation of their fair value
