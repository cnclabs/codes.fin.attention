the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations in the analysis and comparison of torchmark s operating results with prior periods  two divestitures that occurred in should be taken into account a the divestiture of waddell reed b the sale of family service divestiture of asset management operations 
waddell reed  torchmark s asset management subsidiary  completed an initial public offering in march  of approximately million shares of its common stock 
the offering represented approximately of waddell reed s shares 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after underwriters fees and expenses 
waddell reed used million of the proceeds to repay existing notes owed to torchmark and other torchmark subsidiaries and retained the remaining million 
torchmark s million proceeds from the note repayments were invested or used to pay down debt 
see the discussion on investments on page  liquidity on page  and capital resources on page of this report 
the initial public offering resulted in a million gain which was added to torchmark s additional paid in capital 
torchmark retained the remaining of the waddell reed stock 
on november   torchmark distributed its remaining investment in waddell reed through a tax free spin off to torchmark shareholders 
each torchmark shareholder of record on october  received a total of 
waddell reed shares per torchmark share 
after the spin off  torchmark retained no further ownership interest in waddell reed 
as a result of the transaction  torchmark incurred million in expense related to the spin off  the majority of which was million of corporate federal income tax resulting from the distribution of a portion of the policyholder surplus account of a torchmark life subsidiary 
torchmark has accounted for the spin off of waddell reed as a disposal of a segment 
accordingly  torchmark s financial statements for and all prior periods have been modified to present the net assets and operating results of waddell reed as discontinued operations of the disposed segment 
the million expense of the spin off is included in discontinued operations under the caption loss on disposal 
the distribution of the waddell reed shares resulted in a reduction in torchmark s shareholders equity in the approximate amount of million  consisting of the equity in waddell reed  net of the minority interest 
torchmark s share of waddell reed s earnings for was million after reduction for the minority interest during the period subsequent to the initial public offering but before the spin off 
this compares with million for and million for  when torchmark owned of waddell reed for the entire periods 
sale of family service

family service  which was acquired in  is a preneed funeral insurer but has not issued any new policies since consideration for the sale was million in cash 
torchmark recorded a pretax realized loss on the sale of approximately million  but incurred a tax expense on the transaction of million for a total after tax loss of million 
in connection with the sale  torchmark will continue to service the policies in force of family service for the next five years for a fee of million per year plus certain variable processing costs 
during  family service accounted for million in revenues and million in pretax income 
through may   family service contributed million in revenues and million in pretax income 
invested assets were million and total assets were million at the date of the sale 
summary of operating results 
torchmark s management computes a classification of income called net operating income 
net operating income is the measure of income torchmark s management focuses on to evaluate the performance of the operations of the company 
it differs from net income as reported in the financial statements in that it excludes unusual and nonrecurring income or loss items which distort operating trends 
the following items were excluded from net income as reported in torchmark s financial statements in order to compute net operating income realized investment gains and losses and the related adjustment to deferred acquisition costs  net of tax  torchmark s pro rata share of vesta insurance group s vesta s adjustment to its equity as a result of the accounting irregularities and earnings restatement reported by vesta in the second quarter of  amounting to a million loss after tax  the million nonrecurring expenses of the asset management operations waddell reed spin off  the nonrecurring loss on the disposal of energy operations in in the after tax amount of million  and the nonrecurring loss from the redemption by torchmark of its debt in the second quarter of  in the amount of million net of tax 
realized investment losses in  which were million net of tax  included a million after tax loss from the sale of family service  a million after tax loss on the writedown of torchmark s vesta holdings  and a million after tax loss from the sale of a portion of the vesta holdings 
losses in  in the after tax amount of million  were primarily a result of intentional sales of fixed maturity investments at a loss to offset current and prior year taxable gains 
the vesta adjustment and the disposal of energy operations is discussed on page and the redemption of torchmark debt is discussed under the caption capital resources on page of this report 
net operating income is then further divided into three categories continuing insurance operations  discontinued operations  and torchmark s equity in the earnings of vesta 
continuing insurance operations consists of the operations of torchmark s insurance subsidiaries and corporate activities 
the operations of this group is reflective of torchmark s operations after the waddell reed spin off 
discontinued operations include the discontinued asset management activities of waddell reed 
a reconciliation of net operating income from continuing insurance operations to net income on a per diluted share basis is as follows reconciliation of per share insurance net operating income to reported net income insurance net operating income discontinued asset management operations

net income diluted share basis in accordance with accounting rules  torchmark reports earnings per share data as basic and diluted 
basic earnings per share are based on average shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of torchmark s employee stock options for which the exercise price was lower than the market price during the year and their impact on shares outstanding 
diluted earnings per share differ from basic earnings per share in that they are influenced by changes in the market price of torchmark stock and the number of options as well as the number of shares outstanding 
unless otherwise indicated  all references to per share data in this report are on the basis of diluted shares 
a comparison of torchmark s basic and diluted earnings per share is as follows earnings and earnings per share dollar amounts in thousands  except for per share data for the year ended december  insurance net operating income amount    per share basic diluted net operating income all continuing and discontinued operations amount    per share basic diluted net income amount    per share basic diluted insurance operations

total premium increased million or in  accounting for of the million increase in total revenues excluding realized gains and losses 
life insurance premium increased million  or and health premium grew million or in net investment income increased in to million 
the million or growth in revenues excluding realized investment gains and losses resulted largely from the increase in life premium of million or 
investment income  which rose  also contributed million to revenue growth 
other operating expenses have declined in both and from the respective prior year 
they declined from million in to million in in  expenses declined million or  primarily due to a reduction in litigation expense 
as a percentage of revenues  excluding realized gains and losses  other operating expenses declined in each period and were in  in  and in other operating expenses consist of insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company 
the components of torchmark s revenues and operations are described in more detail in the discussion of insurance and investment segments found on pages through of this report 
the effective tax rate for torchmark was in  compared with in and in excluding goodwill  the effective tax rates for insurance operations were   and in  and  respectively 
the decline in the effective rate resulted from additional energy tax credits that were available as a part of the consideration from the disposition of the energy segment 
the following table is a summary of torchmark s continuing insurance net operating income 
net underwriting income is defined by torchmark management as premium income less net policy obligations  commissions  acquisition expenses  and insurance administrative expenses 
excess investment income is defined as tax equivalent net investment income reduced by the interest credited to net policy liabilities and financing costs 
financing costs include the interest on torchmark s debt and the net cost of the monthly income preferred securities mips

torchmark s core operations are segmented into insurance underwriting operations and investment operations 
insurance underwriting activities are further segmented into life insurance  health insurance  and annuity product groups 
a discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
life insurance 
life insurance is torchmark s largest segment  with life premium representing of total premium and life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense representing of the total 
sales of this group of products continues to be emphasized because of its higher underwriting margins and larger asset base resulting from higher reserve levels 
a larger asset base provides torchmark the opportunity to increase investment income 
life insurance premium increased in to million from million in life premium rose in sales of life insurance  in terms of annualized premium  were million in  increasing over sales of million 
this compares with growth in sales over annualized life premium in force was billion at december   compared with billion at year end  an increase of 
annualized premium grew in from million at year end annualized premium in force and issued data includes amounts collected on certain interest sensitive life products which are not recorded as premium income but excludes single premium income and policy account charges 
the sale of family service on june  caused some distortion in life insurance results for excluding family service operations  life insurance premium income would have increased to million in and to million in annualized life premium in force would have increased in and in life insurance products are marketed through a variety of distribution channels 
the following table presents life insurance premium by distribution method excluding family service during each of the three years ended december  life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american independent agency    united american exclusive agency    direct response    liberty national exclusive agency    american income exclusive agency    military independent agency    united investors exclusive agency    other    direct response marketing is conducted through direct mail  co op mailings  television and consumer magazine advertising  and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups  unions and associations 
it markets a line of primarily life products to juveniles and adults with face amounts of less than thousand on average 
the direct response operation is a profitable distribution channel for torchmark characterized by lower acquisition costs than torchmark s agency based marketing systems 
direct response life operations have grown rapidly since the early s when new direct distribution media and target markets were added 
prior to that time  the primary product was a direct mail juvenile life product 
in both and  this distribution center had torchmark s highest growth in life insurance premium in dollar amount and accounted for over of torchmark s life insurance premium during direct response premium was million in  increasing over premium of million 
direct response life premium in grew over premium of million 
leading the other distribution channels  annualized premium sold by the direct response operation was million in  rising over sales of million 
the sales increased over sales of million 
direct response life annualized premium in force rose to million at december  from million a year earlier 
at december   direct response life annualized premium in force was second only to that of the liberty national exclusive agency 
direct response life insurance annualized premium in force grew in in addition to growth in life insurance sales and premium  the direct response operation has promoted growth in some of torchmark s agent based distribution channels through providing marketing support 
direct response marketing support directly contributed to the increase in health sales by the united american exclusive agency and its resulting agent recruiting success 
methods to extend direct response marketing support to other torchmark agent based distribution channels are being explored 
the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system represented torchmark s largest portion of life insurance premium income in each of the three years presented  with premium of million representing of total life premium 
the annualized life premium in force of the liberty agency was million at year end  compared with million and million at year ends and  respectively 
life premium sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  grew during to million 
this growth in life insurance sales compares to a decline in life sales during of to million 
the turnaround in sales growth in the liberty agency was largely attributable to growth in the number of agents from  agents at year end to  agents at year end  an increase of 
the number of first year agents climbed in to  after having increased in new agent recruitment programs were implemented in late resulting in the new agent growth 
additionally  training programs have been employed to improve the retention of newly recruited agents 
management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to the continued growth of sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
the liberty national agency has completed the transition from a debit style renewal premium collection system to a direct bill or bank draft collection system 
as a result  less than of premium was debit collected in another of torchmark s distribution channels for life insurance is a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former commissioned and non commissioned military officers who sell exclusively to commissioned and non commissioned military officers and their families 
this business is comprised of whole life products with term insurance riders 
the quality of the business produced by this military agency is outstanding and is characterized by extremely low lapse rates 
life premium income from this distribution system grew to million in  representing the largest percentage growth in life premium of any torchmark distribution channel in premium for this agency rose to million in annualized life premium in force for the military distribution system grew in to million  after having increased to million in in both years this distribution system produced the greatest amount of growth in annualized life premium in force on a percentage basis 
a major factor in this growth of in force premium relates to the very high persistency associated with this business 
annualized premium sold during by this agency was million  an increase of over sales of million in production almost doubled in from sales of million 
the american income exclusive agency is a distribution system that focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
at december   premium from this system accounted for of torchmark s total life premium 
american income s premium increased to million in  after having risen in to million 
annualized life premium in force was million at year end  an increase of over premium in force of million 
annualized life premium in force rose in sales  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  million in  and million in this agency experienced a decline in agents during  contributing to the decline in sales 
management is currently implementing changes to american income s marketing organization to focus on the recruitment and retention of agents 
the united investors exclusive agency is made up of waddell reed sales representatives  who market the life insurance products of united investors life under a marketing agreement with waddell reed 
this agency accounted for of torchmark s life premium in premium income rose in to million  following a increase in to million 
sales growth in this agency in terms of annualized premium issued was in  the highest life production of any torchmark agency in terms of percentage growth 
sales were million in  compared with million in annualized life premium in force increased to million at december   of torchmark s total life premium in force 
in addition to the growth in life insurance sales  this agency has also increased production of variable life collections from million in to million in  almost a fourfold increase 
although variable life collections are not included in premium in force data  they are indicative of growth in the variable life account balance 
indirectly  they add to premium revenue through the policy account charges for insurance coverage and administration as the account balance grows 
the united american independent and exclusive agencies represented about of total life premium in on a combined basis  life premium rose to million in premium for these agencies increased in to million

the underwriting margin rose in to million  after having increased to million in excluding family service  the underwriting margin increased in to million and in to million 
obligation ratios for life business rose slightly in  caused by an increase in mortality 
fluctuations in mortality are normal in the life insurance industry and are not indicative of a trend 
health insurance 
torchmark markets its supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income during each of the three years ended december  by distribution method 
health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount total amount total amount total united american independent agency    united american exclusive agen cy    liberty national exclusive agency    american income exclusive agen cy    direct response    health insurance premium increased to million in over premium of million 
in  health premium rose over premium 
however  was the first year since that torchmark recorded a year over year increase in premium for this segment 
annualized health premium in force grew to million at december  over the previous year end balance of million 
health premium in force rose during sales of health premium  in terms of annualized premium issued  were million in  increasing over sales of million 
sales in grew over the prior year 
sales of health insurance have accelerated greatly in the past two years due to increases in sales of medicare supplement policies 
prior to  torchmark had not experienced year over year sales growth in health insurance for five years 
health products sold by torchmark insurance companies include medicare supplement  cancer  long term care  and other under age limited benefit supplemental medical and hospitalization products 
as a percentage of annualized health premium in force at december   medicare supplement accounted for  cancer  and other health products 
medicare supplement and cancer annualized premium in force was million and million  respectively  at december  medicare supplement insurance is sold primarily by the united american exclusive agency and the united american independent agency 
while health sales in both agencies have grown in the past three years  sales by the exclusive agency exceeded the health sales of the independent agency in this agency sold million in annualized health premium in  a gain over the prior year 
health sales of million in rose over sales 
this agency accounted for million of the million in health premium growth in it also was instrumental in health annualized premium growth in both and  accounting for million of the million growth during in in force premium and adding million to annualized health premium in force in one factor in the growth in medicare supplement sales in the united american exclusive agency is the targeted marketing support provided by the direct response operation 
the united american independent agency continues to represent the largest amount of torchmark s health premium in force 
the agency s million of annualized health premium in force at december   of which million was medicare supplement premium in force  was of torchmark s total health premium in force 
medicare supplement sales by the united american independent agency were million in  a increase over in spite of increased medicare supplement sales  medicare supplement annualized premium in force for the united american independent agency remained level at year end compared with year end this occurred because recent years increases in sales resulting in additions to in force policies have been offset by normal lapses occurring in the large  aging block of in force medicare supplement policies 
medicare supplement policies are highly regulated at both the federal and state levels with limits on agent compensation and mandated minimum loss ratios 
however  they remain a popular supplemental health policy with the country s large and growing group of medicare beneficiaries 
about of all medicare beneficiaries obtain medicare supplements to cover at least some of the deductibles and coinsurance for which the federal medicare program does not pay 
during the last few years  torchmark has focused on developing its united american exclusive agency to serve this market 
using the direct response operation  both targeted marketing support and increased agent recruiting have successfully led to increased sales 
because of loss ratio regulation  underwriting margins on medicare supplements are less than on torchmark s life business 
however  due to united american s low cost  service oriented customer service and claims administration  as well as its economies of scale  it is a profitable line of business 
until recently the primary competition for medicare supplement sales had come from medicare health maintenance organizations hmo s  the managed care alternative to traditional fee for service medicare which eliminated the need for a supplemental policy 
however  in the last few years  growing public dissatisfaction with managed care  increased medical cost inflation and increased federal government regulatory pressures on medicare hmo s have caused an increasing number of hmo s to withdraw from the market  reducing that competition 
other regulatory issues continue to affect the medicare supplement market 
medical cost inflation and changes to the medicare program cause the need for annual rate increases  which generally require state insurance department approval 
in addition  congress and the federal administration have begun studying ways to finance the medicare program in the future as it is anticipated that the program could be insolvent within the next decade 
this would occur because of the growth in the number of baby boomers becoming eligible for medicare during that period and increasing medical cost inflation generally due to increased utilization 
therefore  it is likely that changes will be made to the medicare program at sometime in the future 
however  regardless of proposed changes  it appears that there will continue to be an important role for private insurers in helping senior citizens cover their healthcare costs 
as a result  medicare supplements should continue as a popular product for senior age consumers 
cancer insurance premium in force grew in to million  compared with growth in sales of this product declined from sales of million to million 
sales in were also million 
growth in cancer annualized premium in force has been attributable in large part to premium rate increases to offset increased health care costs 
cancer insurance products are sold primarily by the liberty national exclusive agency 
this agency represented of torchmark s total cancer annualized premium in force at december  annualized premium in force for other health products declined in to million  after declining in other health sales declined in to million 
sales increased in  however  with annualized premium issued rising to million 
a large factor in the sales increase was the increased issue of a limited benefit hospital surgical product sold by the united american independent agency 
with the resurgence of medicare supplement sales opportunities  the emphasis of the united american independent agency during returned to medicare supplement and less on other health products 
as a result  sales and annualized premium in force by this agency of other health products declined as compared with health insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands of of of amount premium amount premium amount premium premium    policy obligations    required reserve inter est    net policy obligations    amortization of acquisi tion costs    commissions and premium taxes    required interest on de ferred acquisition costs    total expense    insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense 
   health insurance underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined in to million  after having declined in as a percentage of premium  underwriting income before other income and administrative expense declined in the years and from the prior year  respectively 
margins have lagged premium growth because of higher obligation costs 
medicare supplement margins are restrained by the federally mandated minimum loss ratio of and by competition 
cancer obligation ratios have increased in each year because of healthcare inflationary pressures 
to the extent management is able to obtain timely and adequate premium rate increases from regulatory authorities to offset these cost increases  margins may be stabilized on cancer business 
torchmark continues to seek such rate increases 
annuities 
annuity products are marketed by torchmark to service a variety of needs  including retirement income and long term  tax deferred growth opportunities 
torchmark s annuities are sold almost entirely by the united investors exclusive agency 
this agency consists of the waddell reed sales force which markets united investors annuities and other products under a marketing agreement 
in  this agency collected million of torchmark s total million in annuity collections 
the united investors agency accounted for of total annuity policy charges in annuities are sold on both a fixed and variable basis 
fixed annuity deposits are held and invested by torchmark and are obligations of the company 
variable annuity deposits are invested at the policyholder s direction into his choice among a variety of mutual funds managed by waddell reed  which vary in degree of investment risk and return 
a fixed annuity investment account is also available as a variable annuity investment option 
investments pertaining to variable annuity deposits are reported as separate account assets and the corresponding deposit balances for variable annuities are reported as separate account liabilities 
annuity premium is added to the annuity account balance as a deposit and is not reflected in income 
revenues on both fixed and variable annuities are derived from charges to the annuity account balances for insurance risk  administration  and surrender  depending on the structure of the contract 
variable accounts are also charged an investment fee and a sales charge 
torchmark benefits to the extent these policy charges exceed actual costs and to the extent actual investment income exceeds the investment income which is credited to fixed annuity policyholders 
the following table presents the annuity account balance at each year end and the annuity collections for each year for both fixed and variable annuities  excluding family service 
annuity deposit balances annuity collections dollar amounts in dollar amounts in millions thousands fixed    variable       total       collections of fixed annuity premium were million in  compared with million in  a decline of 
management believes that the low interest environment in and has been a factor in the reduced sales of fixed annuities  as variable annuities and alternative investments have grown more attractive 
fixed annuity collections were million in the fixed annuity deposit balance increased in to million at year end 
it rose in the prior period from million at year end to million at the end of during  torchmark sold family service  a wholly owned provider of preneed annuities 
while the sale of these preneed annuities had been discontinued in  this block of annuities remained on deposit until family was sold 
at the date of sale  this deposit balance was approximately million 
variable annuity collections rose to million in variable collections were flat in  compared with the prior year at million 
the strength in financial markets has had a positive influence on sales of variable annuities in both and the variable account balance has experienced rapid growth in recent years  rising in to billion at december   in to billion at year end  and to billion at the end of strong financial markets in all of these periods contributed greatly to the growth 
variable accounts are valued based on the market values of the underlying securities

policy charges have also grown in each period  rising in to million and in to million 
growth in policy charges is primarily related to the growth in the size of the account balance  but is also attributable to the increase in the number of annuity contracts in force and the cumulative effect of the growth in sales over the past few years upon which the sales charge is based 
investments 
the following table summarizes torchmark s investment income and excess investment income

it is defined as tax equivalent investment income reduced by the interest cost credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
excess investment income is increased in a number of ways an increase in investment yields over the rates credited to policyholders liabilities or over the rates applicable to torchmark debt  growth in assets in relation to policy liabilities and debt  and the efficient use of capital resources and cash flow 
net investment income rose to million in  compared with an increase of to million in on a tax equivalent basis  in which the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities  investment income also rose in both and these increases in investment income resulted primarily from the growth in the invested asset base during each period 
mean invested assets increased in and in asset growth in was caused primarily by the receipt of million in proceeds from the waddell reed offering in early  offset somewhat by the sale of investments to repay debt and to buy torchmark stock 
the family service sale also negatively impacted net investment income due to the loss of approximately million in invested assets at the date of the sale 
growth in excess investment income was due to the accumulation of the investments backing life reserves and the reinvestment of cash flow 
the increases in excess investment income were greater than the growth in net investment income  however 
in  excess investment income increased to million 
the million increase in in excess investment income resulted primarily from the proceeds of the waddell reed offering which provided torchmark with million in additional funds to invest or to apply to outstanding debt 
there was also million of interest income on an internal financing with waddell reed included in income 
also in  torchmark essentially refinanced million principal amount of its long term debt with either short term debt or lower yielding investments sales  saving an average of basis points in financing costs 
the family services disposition had minimal impact on the change in excess investment income 
the loss of family s investment portfolio did result in a loss of net investment income  but this loss was offset by the reduction in required interest caused by the disposition of net policy obligations and the receipt of million in proceeds from the sale which were added to investments 
in  the growth in excess investment income resulted primarily from the greater growth in average invested assets relative to the growth in net policy liabilities 
also  financing costs declined during the period as a result of debt paydowns 
torchmark s share repurchase program  which was renewed after the waddell reed spin off  had little impact on excess investment income in because purchases were made late in the year 
however  in  share purchases will negatively affect growth in excess investment income 
while there is a cost of capital associated with share purchases  per share earnings could be improved

treasury rates continued a downward trend in the rates on corporate and municipal securities did not decline to the same extent as treasuries  resulting in a spread widening 
for this reason  torchmark was able to continue its fixed maturity acquisition program relatively unchanged

torchmark s primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk which is the risk that a change in a securities value could occur from a change in interest rates 
this risk is significant to torchmark s investment portfolio because its fixed income holdings amount to of total investments 
the effects of these interest rate fluctuations on fixed investments are reflected on an after tax basis in torchmark s shareholders equity from marking these investments to market 
the actual interest rate risk to torchmark is reduced because the effect that changes in rates have on assets is offset by the effect they have on insurance liabilities and on debt 
interest assumptions are used to compute the majority of torchmark s insurance liabilities 
these liabilities  net of deferred acquisition costs  were billion at december   compared with fixed income investments of billion at amortized cost at the same date 
because of the long term nature of insurance liabilities  temporary changes in value caused by rate fluctuations have little bearing on ultimate obligations 
these liabilities are not marked to market 
market risk is managed in a manner consistent with torchmark s investment objectives 
torchmark seeks to maintain a portfolio of high quality fixed maturity assets that may be sold in response to changing market conditions 
a significant change in the level of interest rates  changes in credit quality of individual securities  or changes in the relative values of a security or asset sector are the primary factors that influence such sales 
occasionally  the need to raise cash for various operating commitments may also necessitate the sale of a security 
volatility in the value of torchmark s fixed income holdings is reduced by maintaining a relatively short term portfolio  of which matures within ten years 
also  the portfolio and market conditions are constantly evaluated for appropriate action 
no derivative instruments are used to manage torchmark s exposure to market risk in the investment portfolio 
a swap instrument was entered into to allow torchmark to participate in the downward trend in interest rates in connection with its mips as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statement on page of this report and in capital resources on page of this report 
a cap instrument was also entered into to protect torchmark from the market risk on an increase in rates associated with the swap on this security 
the liability for torchmark s insurance policy obligations is computed using interest assumptions  some of which are contractually guaranteed 
a reduction in market interest rates of a permanent nature could cause investment return to fall below amounts guaranteed 
torchmark s insurance companies participate in the cash flow testing procedures imposed by statutory insurance regulations  the purpose of which is to insure that such liabilities are adequate to meet the company s obligations under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
it has been determined from those procedures that torchmark s insurance policy liabilities  when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such liabilities and the investment income expected to be received on such assets  are adequate to meet the obligations and expenses of torchmark s insurance activities in all but the most extreme circumstances 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark s interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio 
the data is prepared through a model that measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments would have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
change in interest rates market value of in fixed maturity basis portfolio points millions financial condition liquidity 
liquidity pertains to an institution s ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark is highly liquid  as evidenced by its three sources of liquidity its positive cash flow from operations  its portfolio of marketable securities  and its line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance operations generate positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
cash flows provided from operations were million in  compared with million in and million in in addition to operating cash flows  torchmark received million in investment maturities and repayments during  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are used to build an investment base to fund future requirements 
torchmark s cash and short term investments were million at december   compared with million at year end in addition to torchmark s liquid assets  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities which are available for sale should the need arise 
these securities had a value of billion at december  torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings up to a specified maximum amount 
the maximum amount was increased during to million and was at this level on december  interest is charged at variable rates for borrowings 
this line of credit is further designated as a backup credit line for a commercial paper program not to exceed million  whereby torchmark may borrow from either the credit line or issue commercial paper at any time but may not borrow in excess of a total of million on the combined facilities 
at december   million in face amount of commercial paper was outstanding and there were no borrowings on the line of credit 
a fee is charged on the entire million facility 
in accordance with the agreements  torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization and earnings 
at december   torchmark was in full compliance with these covenants 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
dividends are paid by subsidiaries to the parent in order to meet its dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
dividends from insurance subsidiaries of torchmark are limited to the greater of statutory net gain from operations  excluding capital gains and losses  on an annual noncumulative basis or of surplus  in the absence of special approval  and distributions are not permitted in excess of statutory net worth 
subsidiaries are also subject to certain minimum capital requirements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries has been and is expected to be more than adequate for parent company operations 
during  a maximum amount of million will be available to torchmark from insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval 
capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of long and short term debt  mips  and shareholders equity 
torchmark s debt consists primarily of its funded debt and its commercial paper facility 
an analysis of torchmark s funded debt outstanding at year ends and on the basis of par value is as follows principal principal year amount amount instrument due rate thousands thousands sinking fund debentures  senior notes  senior debentures   notes   notes   total funded debt   current maturity of long term debt  debt held by subsidiaries  long term debt   the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
during  torchmark received approximately million in intercompany note repayments from waddell reed as a result of their initial public offering 
torchmark utilized a portion of these funds to pay down funded debt 
it has also taken advantage of the lower interest rate environment in to refinance existing funded debt at lower short term rates 
in early  torchmark repaid million principal amount on its sinking fund debentures due in  of which million was a mandatory redemption and million was an optional repayment under the terms of the agreement 
on april   torchmark called the remaining million principal balance of this debt at the prevailing call price of  or million 
a loss on the redemption of debt was recorded in the second quarter of in the after tax amount of million  representing the difference between the total call price and the carrying value of million 
in addition to the call  torchmark s senior notes  principal amount million  matured on may  torchmark borrowed on its commercial paper facility to repay the sinking fund debentures that were called and to repay its senior notes upon maturity with accrued interest  in the combined amount of million 
additionally  in october   torchmark  through a subsidiary  acquired million principal amount of its notes due in the open market at a cost of million 
during  torchmark repaid million principal amount on its sinking fund debentures due in  of which million was a mandatory redemption and million was an optional repayment under the terms of the agreement 
it also repaid thousand principal amount of its senior debentures in under the terms of a put provision 
the mips were issued in november  at a redemption amount of million with an annual dividend rate of 
they are subject to a mandatory redemption in full at september   although torchmark may elect to extend the mips for up to an additional years if certain conditions are met 
they are redeemable at torchmark s option at any time after september  while torchmark is obligated to pay dividends at a fixed rate of  torchmark has in place a ten year interest rate swap agreement with an unaffiliated party to reduce financing costs 
the swap expires in the swap agreement calls for torchmark to pay a variable rate on the million face amount in exchange for payment of the fixed dividend by the other party 
torchmark is at risk on this instrument for higher financing costs to the extent interest rates rise during the remaining term 
this risk is limited  however  by a five year interest rate cap which torchmark acquired in conjunction with the swap agreement that insures the variable rate cannot exceed 
the cap expires on september  at december   the variable rate was 
during  torchmark s after tax dividend cost for the mips was million  compared with million that would have been incurred without the swap and cap transactions 
torchmark s after tax cost in was million and in was million  saving million and million in each of those years  respectively 
torchmark reduced its shareholder cash dividend paid in the fourth quarter of to 
per share from 
paid in the previous four quarters 
the fourth quarter dividend was paid prior to the spin off of waddell reed 
because the dividend waddell reed pays on its shares represents approximately 
per torchmark share  torchmark s quarterly dividend is expected to be 
per share each quarter in torchmark resumed its share buyback program in november  after completion of the waddell reed spin off 
purchases of million shares were made on the open market during november and december of at a cost of million 
funds for these purchases were derived primarily from the sale of investments 
during  torchmark acquired million shares at a cost of million 
share purchases of million shares were made in for million 
torchmark will continue to make share purchases under its share repurchase program on the open market when prices are attractive 
share purchases have a favorable impact on earnings per share and return on equity  but negatively affect book value per share 
short term debt consists primarily of torchmark s commercial paper outstanding but also includes the current maturity of long term debt 
the commercial paper balance outstanding at december  was million at carrying value  compared with a balance of million a year earlier 
as previously noted  torchmark essentially refinanced million face amount of funded debt with additional short term borrowings 
these borrowings were offset somewhat by the use of million in waddell reed offering proceeds for repayment 
the commercial paper borrowing balance fluctuates based on torchmark s current cash needs 
there was no current maturity of long term debt at year end  compared with million a year earlier 
shareholders equity increased to billion at december   over december  shareholders equity of billion 
growth in shareholders equity was greatly impacted by the waddell reed offering and spin off in proceeds from the march  offering added million to torchmark s shareholders equity  but equity was reduced by million of minority interest at the time of the offering representing the of waddell reed that torchmark no longer owned 
additionally  the november  spin off caused a reduction in torchmark s equity of million  representing its carrying value of waddell reed at the time of the spin 
book value per share was at year end  compared with at year end after adjusting for the impact on shareholders equity for security value fluctuations due to changes in interest rates in financial markets  book value per share was at year end  an increase of over at year end return on common shareholders equity was in  compared with in the return on equity ratios exclude the mark up or down of shareholders equity for changes in security values caused by fluctuations in market interest rates 
they also exclude all discontinued operations  equity in earnings of vesta  and realized investment gains and losses 
total debt as a percentage of total capitalization continues to decline and was at december  in the computation of this ratio  the mips are counted as equity and the effect of fluctuations in security values based on changes in interest rates in financial markets are excluded 
this debt to capitalization ratio was at year end and at year end the decline in this ratio resulted primarily from the funded debt paydowns  net of the increase in short term debt 
the debt to capitalization ratio was also favorably impacted by the net increase in torchmark s shareholders equity resulting from the waddell reed offering and spin off 
torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest  taxes and discontinued operations to interest requirements also continues to improve and was for  compared with in and in torchmark s interest expense declined in from million to million 
interest expense was million in other items transactions regarding vesta 
since  torchmark has held a passive investment in million shares of vesta  a property insurance carrier  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of vesta 
in june   vesta announced that a an investigation of accounting irregularities that occurred during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of would result in an aggregate million net after tax reduction in previously reported net income  and  in addition  that b it would restate its historical financial statements for the period of through the first quarter of  reflecting reductions in reported net after tax earnings of million for the period of through and million for the first quarter of to reflect its pro rata share of vesta s cumulative reported financial corrections  torchmark recorded a pre tax charge of million million after tax or 
per diluted share in the second quarter of additionally  vesta is now subject to numerous class action lawsuits in state and federal courts filed subsequent to such announcements 
during the fourth quarter of  torchmark announced it had entered into an agreement to sell approximately million shares of vesta common stock to an unaffiliated insurance carrier for a share 
in its fourth quarter form q  torchmark reported its intent to sell its remaining vesta shares and vacate the two vesta board seats it occupied 
in view of the pending transaction  torchmark adjusted the carrying value of its holdings in vesta to estimated net realizable value of million  effective september  the adjustment produced an after lax realized loss of million or 
per torchmark diluted share 
torchmark further reported that because of the agreement to sell the vesta shares  the resulting writedown  and the vacating of the board seats  that torchmark planned to discontinue equity method accounting in accordance with accounting standards 
as of december   the terms of the agreement were not met by the unaffiliated insurance carrier and the contract to sell the vesta shares was terminated 
in the meantime  on december   torchmark sold thousand vesta shares to another unrelated institution at a price of per share 
torchmark realized a million after tax loss on the sale 
the sale reduced torchmark s ownership of vesta to million shares or approximately of vesta at december  because torchmark s interest in vesta exceeded and the sale contract with the insurance carrier expired  torchmark continued equity method accounting for its holdings in vesta 
torchmark s carrying value for vesta continues to reflect the previously taken writedown 
subsequent to vesta s june  announcement involving the accounting irregularities and the financial restatements  torchmark recorded its equity in vesta s earnings in the quarter that vesta reported those earnings 
as a result  torchmark s equity in vesta s reported earnings during  including the restatements  was a pretax loss of million 
torchmark carried vesta at a value of million at december  disposal of energy segment 
on september   torchmark completed the sale of its energy business segment including its energy asset management subsidiary  torch energy advisors incorporated teai  and its black warrior coalbed methane investment 
these operations  which were classified as discontinued operations in torchmark s financial statements during the period prior to the sale  were sold to a teai management group 
after the sale  torchmark had no controlling ownership interest in any energy asset management organization 
in addition to previously transferred securities  warrants  and section energy related tax credits  which approximated million at closing  torchmark received subordinated debt and notes totaling million along with million in cash 
after closing costs and retained liabilities  torchmark recorded a pretax loss of million and an after tax loss of million from the sale  or 
per share 
litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  most of which involve punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation has the potential for significant adverse results 
it is impossible to predict the extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case  since the amount of punitive damages in alabama is left largely to the discretion of the jury in each case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
year compliance 
the new millennium poses a significant concern to all businesses which use computer systems or electronic data in their operations 
this concern arises because these organizations have been processing computer systems and programs that cannot always identify a proper date 
for many years  programs were written using a two digit code to represent a year 
at the beginning of the year  more digits are needed to accurately determine the date in these programs 
without addressing this issue  many computer programs could fail or produce erroneous results 
additionally  companies which are electronically engaged with other businesses or which rely on other businesses for services are exposed to risk of failure by the electronic devices and computer systems of those other entities to the extent they are not year compliant 
the potential of failure of these systems creates considerable uncertainty and could potentially adversely affect the ongoing operations and stability of a business 
torchmark is exposed to these risks should its computer systems fail due to date related problems 
torchmark is also reliant on a number of third party businesses and governmental agencies with which it either interacts electronically or depends upon for services in the conduct of its business 
these institutions include but are not limited to banks  financial institutions  telecommunication companies  utilities  mail delivery organizations  and a variety of governmental agencies 
should torchmark s computer systems or the systems of its third party business partners not be compliant  torchmark may be exposed to considerable risks  including business interruption  loss of revenue  increased expense  loss of policyholders  and litigation 
to reduce its business risk to an acceptable level  torchmark has established a project plan to insure that the company s business critical computer systems will be year compliant 
this plan also addresses third party compliance issues 
under the direction of executive management  objectives and timetables have been set forth to achieve compliance in each geographic location where torchmark operates 
progress toward achieving those objectives is constantly monitored 
torchmark currently expects the entire project  including all year testing activities  to be completed during as of december   torchmark remains on schedule to meet all of its year compliance requirements 
all known required software changes have been completed  and the related testing is in process with plans for completion in with regard to third party concerns  torchmark has in process the following procedures torchmark is confirming  with its software vendors  the year readiness of its purchased software packages because torchmark has purchased software packages on all of its computer platforms  torchmark is verifying the year compliance status of its financial business partners computer and data communications systems to insure readiness  including data interface testing with third parties  and all of torchmark s electronic operational systems telephones  security  utility  environmental are being evaluated for year compliance 
as an example of torchmark s interface testing with selected third parties  torchmark is utilizing electronic data from selected third parties in processing medicare supplement benefit data using year test data 
torchmark is also arranging similar testing with a selected number of banks 
while torchmark is making every effort to verify the compliance of third parties  no assurances as to the compliance of their computer systems can be given 
torchmark has used primarily its own employees to complete its year project 
other than completion of software testing  all significant year project milestones for internal computer systems have been completed 
confirmation of third party compliance and electronic data interface testing with third parties is continuing with completion expected during torchmark has spent million on its year project activities to date  including internal programming costs  outside contractors  and replacement costs 
these costs have been expensed as incurred 
total project cost is expected to be approximately million 
year contingency plans are being developed for critical risk areas 
management throughout the organization has established and documented a contingency plan for torchmark s most critical systems and interfaces with business partners within each individual s responsibility 
such contingency plans include possible manual operation efforts  staff adjustments  outside services  and alternative procedures 
these contingency plans will be maintained well into new accounting rules accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb statement no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application of all of the provisions of this statement encouraged 
early adoption of selective provisions is prohibited 
prior periods may not be restated for comparability 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting and reporting of derivative instruments 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and be measured at fair value 
changes in the values of derivatives for the reporting period are reflected as adjustments to earnings through realized gains and losses 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designated as a hedge against exposure to market risks of other instruments or commitments  cash flow risks  or foreign currency risks 
if a derivative is classified as a hedge  the adjustment to earnings is offset by a corresponding change in the value of the item hedged 
hedging relationships may be designated anew upon adoption of this statement 
statement will have minimal impact on torchmark s financial statements 
torchmark has negligible investments in derivative instruments  which are currently valued at fair value in its financial statements 
torchmark s use of derivatives for hedging purposes is very limited
