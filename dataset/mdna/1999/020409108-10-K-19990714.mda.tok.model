the heller facility remains in effect until october  and for annual one year terms thereafter unless either party to the credit agreement provides the other with a written notice of termination one year and days prior to the renewal date 
as of march   the company was in default of certain financial covenants of the heller facility  however  heller has waived these defaults 
the company has a commitment from bank one for a new million credit facility to replace the existing facilities which is expected to be in place prior to august  if the company is unable to close this facility or obtain other satisfactory financing it could have an adverse impact on the company s liquidity and its ability to execute its development plans 
management will continuously evaluate additional capital including possible debt and equity investments in the company to support a more rapid development of the business than would be possible with internal funds

year computer system issue the year issue is the result of computer programs which were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company has implemented a plan to evaluate and address its year issues 
the plan has identified that the company s principle information systems operate in a database environment which uses four digits for the year  and  accordingly  this issue is not expected to have a significant impact on the majority of the company s computer systems 
some moderate modification and testing is still required to verify the year readiness of these systems 
the company believes these final measures will be substantially completed prior to the year the company utilizes certain purchased systems for which the company does not control the programming 
certain of these purchased systems are not in compliance to handle the year issue and have been independently slated for replacement with new systems that better meet the information needs of the company as it expands and deals with the current operating environment 
the company is currently implementing replacement systems 
the company anticipates that these conversions will be completed to provide compliance with the requirements to handle the year issue with no significant operational concerns 
the company also utilizes medical equipment and other non information technology equipment some of which may be impacted by this issue 
the company is in the process of completing a detailed inventory of affected equipment and surveying vendors for remediation plans 
the company is currently unable to predict the outcome of this work  however  it is not currently expected to have a material impact on the company 
the company depends on receipt of payment from its payor sources  which utilize computer software to process those payments 
the company has over  different payors including medicare and medicaid programs  insurance companies and hmo s 
should the federal medicare program and or state medicaid programs  or a large number of private insurance payors cease  or interrupt payments as a result of year issues  this would have a material adverse impact on the company 
approximately of the company s revenues are derived from hcfa funded programs 
to date the company has received no notification from hcfa or any other third party payor that year issues are expected to interrupt payments 
the company is currently unable to predict what effect  if any  the year issue may have on the computer systems of its payors  or in turn on the company 
the above status of the company s year issues is based upon certain management assumptions such as the availability of appropriate implementation personnel  consultants  software vendors and related resources 
management currently believes that the financial resources necessary to accomplish internal compliance will be funded by operating cash flow and will not be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  there is no guarantee that the company s assumptions or expected results will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those expected results 
possible consequences of not addressing the year issue by the company  its vendors or its reimbursement sources include  but are not limited to  a potential inability of the company to obtain sufficient goods and services to operate its business and the potential inability to obtain timely reimbursement for services provided by the company 
the company continues to evaluate contingency plans related to its year issues on an ongoing basis 
however  in any event  contingency plans are highly dependent upon actions taken by its payor sources regarding year system maintenance and modification costs to existing software will be expensed as incurred 
the costs associated with purchasing replacement software will be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the software 
health care reform the health care industry  particularly the visiting nurse and product segments  has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document and proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
certain adverse changes in medicare reimbursement for oxygen therapy services and medicare certified home health services became effective for the company on january  and april  respectively 
see reimbursement changes below 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of medicare and medicaid are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact reimbursement for home health care 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
refer to the sections on reimbursement changes and cautionary statements forward outlook and risks in part i of this report on form k  the notes to the accompanying financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
reimbursement changes in august of  president clinton signed into law the balanced budget act of the bba 
this bill made significant changes in the reimbursement system for medicare certified home health services 
the primary changes that effected the company included a reduction in the reimbursement for oxygen therapy services and a restructuring of the reimbursement system related to medicare certified home care agencies 
oxygen reimbursement medicare reimbursement for certain oxygen therapy services and products was cut for services provided on or after january  and an additional cut took effect on january  future increases have been tied to the consumer price index and will not resume until revenues and pre tax income for the years ended march  and were approximately million and  respectively  lower than they would have been had this reimbursement reduction not taken place 
interim payment system for medicare certified home health nursing services the bba also included a revised interim payment system ips for medicare certified home health services 
ips remains a cost based reimbursement system 
however  per visit cost limits were reduced and a new per beneficiary limit pbl was added 
ips became effective for all home care agencies for cost reporting years beginning on or after october  for the company s agencies the new system went into effect on april  the bba states that ips will remain in effect until a new prospective payment system pps is implemented for cost reporting years beginning on or after october  in legislation passed in october  this date was extended to october  which would go in effect for the company s agencies on april  in the event that home care pps is not implemented by october  the bba as legislated required cost limits then in existence to be lowered by an additional 
the interim payment system  as well as other requirements imposed upon home health providers in the bba were designed to contain the growth in home health care resulting in slower growth in medicare home health expenditures 
as a result of these changes  home health providers are being forced to reduce their costs of providing services and reduce utilization of home care services per beneficiary 
under certain conditions  medicare beneficiaries who had previously been entitled to services no longer qualify under medicare reimbursement guidelines 
the pbl places an aggregate cap on reimbursable costs based on the number of beneficiaries served during a period multiplied by a complicated cost based formula 
this has the effect of placing an additional limit on reimbursement 
the pbl serves to create a ceiling on the amount of care that can be provided to the average beneficiary and constrains the utilization of visits per patient 
the company believes that ips is causing a contraction of medicare home health operations nationwide and is  despite congressional intentions and hcfa assurances to the contrary  a reduction of the medicare home care benefit 
visits performed by the company for medicare beneficiaries declined from  in to  in for a reduction of approximately 
in late calendar and early  the company developed and began implementing action plans to operate under ips 
however  hcfa published final rules on march  that were substantially worse than the industry expected 
accordingly  in april  the company revised its action plans to further reduce costs including staff reductions and appropriately control utilization for operation in the ips environment 
since april   the company has experienced a decline in census  volumes  and length of stay commensurate with the expectations outlined above 
as a result  the company experienced a decline in revenues and contribution from this portion of its operations which incurred costs of approximately million in excess of the new medicare reimbursement limits during fiscal 
in july  the company executed a restructuring plan including work force reduction  branch closings  and changes in compensation programs designed to lower its operating costs and recorded a related charge of  before taxes for severance  branch closings and other non recurring expenses 
as a part of this restructuring program  the company recorded a non recurring write down of goodwill of approximately million before taxes due to the medicare reimbursement impact on the home health operating environment 
the write down of goodwill was required under statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of based upon management s estimate of the impact of the changes in medicare reimbursement for home health nursing services 
management determined that this impact indicated the carrying value of goodwill should be written down by approximately million  based on the net present value of expected future cash flows of specific primarily medicare acquired nursing operations 
this write down is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in october  hcfa announced new cost per visit limits which will be in effect for the company s fiscal year ending march  that are approximately higher than the limits in place during fiscal the company s operating costs exceeded limits by approximately in the fiscal year ended march  for the year ended march  revenues subject to ips were million or of total revenues compared to million and in the year ended march  with respect to pps and the october  deadline  rules and regulations have not yet been published by hcfa and there can be no assurance that such deadline will be met 
such a prospective payment system  or in the alternative such lower cost limits  could have a material adverse effect on the operating results and cash flows of the company 
if the pps deadline is not met and the further limit reduction is made  the company would make every effort to operate within the lower limits 
the company is unable to predict at this time whether it would be able to operate all of its agencies under such limits nor is it able to state at this time what alternative actions  if any  it might take 
state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as the company 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
the company cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting its business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether the company will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in its existing or future markets 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years

market risk of financial instruments the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates
