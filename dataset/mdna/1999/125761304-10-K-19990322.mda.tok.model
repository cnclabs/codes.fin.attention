item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk for the company refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
at december   the company had long term debt outstanding of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of  and million bears interest at fixed rates averaging approximately 
the remaining million bears interest at variable rates which averaged approximately at the end of a increase in short term interest rates on the variable rate debt outstanding at the end of would approximate basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in revenue volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above
