item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that affect operating performance factors that may affect the partnership s future operating results include the relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers  the number of planted acres  the effects general weather patterns have on timing and duration of field work for crop planting and harvesting  the availability and cost of natural gas  the effect of environmental legislation on demand for the partnership s products  the availability of financing sources to fund seasonal working capital needs  and the potential for interruption due to accident or natural disaster 
although the partnership s revenues are principally domestic  nitrogen fertilizer is a global commodity thus the worldwide relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizer can impact partnership sales 
worldwide demand is affected by the growing population and improving economies in developing countries 
worldwide capacity and the availability of nitrogen product exports from major producing areas affect supply 
due to several years of favorable economics in the industry  capacity additions in the form of new and expanded production facilities have been undertaken 
the new nitrogen fertilizer supplies that have come on stream have adversely impacted profit margins until increased demand is sufficient to absorb new supplies or marginal production capacity is shut down 
demand for nitrogen fertilizer in the united states comes primarily from the agricultural market 
approximately of all nitrogen fertilizer is applied to acreage for corn and wheat 
the enactment of the fair act in ended government acreage reduction and production control measures and allowed farmers more flexibility in planting 
changes in corn and wheat acreages can have a significant effect on the demand for the partnership s products 
weather can have a significant effect on demand for the partnership s products 
weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season may result in fewer nitrogen applications 
similar conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall 
weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields  which lowers the income of growers and could reduce the amount of fertilizer purchased in the future 
the partnership s margins are also influenced by the cost of natural gas  the primary raw material in the production of nitrogen fertilizers 
in  natural gas costs accounted for approximately of the partnership s total costs and expenses 
it is the policy of the partnership to hedge of its natural gas requirements for a one year period  and up to of its requirements for the subsequent two year period 
the partnership manages the market price volatility of natural gas prices through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
changes in the market value of these instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
the fair value of these instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices from brokers and computations prepared by the partnership 
annual procurement requirements for natural gas are approximately million mmbtu 
the partnership has hedged of its requirements and of its requirements 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in price 
as of december   the partnership s market risk exposure related to future natural gas requirements being hedged was million based on the sensitivity analysis 
this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments would be more than offset by lower costs for natural gas purchases 
the partnership s business is highly seasonal with the majority of sales occurring during the second quarter in conjunction with spring planting activity 
due to the seasonality of the business and the relatively brief periods during which products can be used by customers  the partnership builds inventories during the first quarter of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales season 
for its current level of sales  the partnership requires lines of credit to fund inventory increases and to support customer credit terms 
the partnership believes that its credit facilities are adequate for expected sales levels in the partnership is subject to federal  state  and local environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  particularly relating to air and water quality 
in the course of its ordinary operations  the partnership generates wastes that may fall within the definition of hazardous substances under federal or state laws 
the partnership s production facilities and storage locations require ongoing operating expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental regulations 
these operating costs consist largely of items related to electrical and chemical usage  waste disposal  laboratory analysis and fees for outside consultants and contractors 
the partnership s operations may be subject to significant interruption if one or more of its facilities were to experience a major accident or other natural disaster 
the partnership currently maintains insurance including business interruption insurance and expects that it will continue to do so in an amount that it believes is sufficient to allow the partnership to withstand major damage to any of its facilities 
risk management and financial instruments market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the partnership due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the partnership uses derivative financial instruments to manage risk in the area of changes in natural gas prices 
it is the general policy of the partnership to avoid unnecessary risk and to limit  to the extent practical  risks associated with operating activities 
management of the partnership may not engage in activities that expose the partnership to speculative or non operating risks 
management is expected to limit risks to acceptable levels 
the use of derivative financial instruments is consistent with the overall business objectives of the partnership 
derivatives are used to manage operating risk within the limits established by the partnership s board of directors  and in response to identified exposures  provided they qualify as hedge activities 
as such  derivative financial instruments are used to hedge firm commitments and forecasted commodity purchase transactions 
results of operations compared with the partnership s sales volumes and prices for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows sales volume avg 
unit price sales volume avg 
unit price tons ton tons ton ammonia uan   urea revenues for the year ended december  declined million  or  primarily due to lower sales prices for all products and to a lesser degree  lower sales volumes 
nitrogen prices fell during due to lower worldwide demand for urea  increased nitrogen production capacity and erratic weather patterns in the partnership s markets 
wet weather in some midwestern areas during the spring and drought conditions in the southwest led to lower demand for uan 
as a result of increased uan availability and lower alternate nitrogen prices  the partnership s uan average unit sale price declined compared with in addition  lower grain prices caused some growers to delay post harvest fertilizer applications  and anticipated continued price weakness caused some fertilizer dealers to delay filling inventories with urea and solutions 
urea average unit sales price declined in compared with due to the continuation of a significant reduction in china s purchases in the world markets 
china had been a major purchaser of urea for import prior to  but increased production in that country led to elevated inventories and a ban on all urea imports until the inventories are reduced 
this created excess supply in the world markets and led to significantly lower prices during cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues increased to for from in due to lower sales prices somewhat offset by lower natural gas costs 
the partnership s natural gas costs decreased in compared with the partnership s forward pricing activities produced million in cost savings compared with spot market natural gas prices during compared with million in cost savings in operating expenses decreased million  or  due to lower pension  administrative and overhead expense allocations from tnc and terra 
interest expense was essentially unchanged in compared to interest income declined million during due to lower levels of cash and short term investments  the result of decreased profitability 
net income per limited partner unit is computed by dividing net income  less an approximate and share allocable to the general partner for the years ended december  and  respectively  by  limited partner units 
according to the agreement of limited partnership of tnclp  net income is allocated to the general partner and the limited partners in each taxable year in the same proportion that available cash for such taxable year was distributed to the general partner and the limited partners 
distributions of available cash are made to the limited partners and to the general partner  except that the general partner is entitled  as an incentive  to larger percentage interests to the extent that distributions of available cash exceed specified target levels  which were not met 
available cash for decreased million from due primarily to lower net income in compared with the partnership s sales volumes and prices for the twelve months ended december  and were as follows sales volume avg 
unit price sales volume avg 
unit price tons ton tons ton ammonia uan   urea revenues for the year ended december  declined million  or  due to lower sales prices for all products and primarily for urea and uan 
also contributing to the lower revenues were lower sales volumes for uan partially offset by higher ammonia and urea sales volumes 
nitrogen prices fell during due to lower worldwide demand for urea  increased nitrogen production capacity and erratic weather patterns in the partnership s markets 
urea sales prices declined in compared with due to a significant reduction in china s purchases in the world markets 
china has been a major purchaser of urea  but increased production in that country led to elevated inventories and a ban on all urea imports until the inventories are reduced 
this created excess supply in the world markets and led to significantly lower prices during wet weather in the south and southwest led to lower demand for uan 
as a result of increased uan availability and lower alternate nitrogen prices  the partnership s uan prices declined compared with in addition  spring weather conditions in the midwest favored ammonia application over uan application 
contributing to favorable ammonia market conditions during were increased corn acres and greater demand for ammonia in the manufacture of upgraded nitrogen fertilizer and industrial products 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues increased to for from in due to lower sales prices and higher natural gas costs 
the partnership s natural gas costs increased in compared with the partnership s forward pricing activities produced million in cost savings compared with spot market natural gas prices during compared with million in operating expenses in decreased 
million  or  due primarily to million lower administrative and overhead expense allocations offset by million higher freight and transportation allocations from tnc and terra 
interest expense increased million in due to the discount on accounts receivable sold under the accounts receivable securitization facility and to the borrowing under the revolving credit agreement used to fund the redemption of the senior preference units 
interest income declined million during due to lower levels of cash and short term investments and the elimination of the reserve amount 
net income per limited partner unit is computed by dividing net income  less an approximate and share allocable to the general partner for the years ended december  and respectively  by  limited partner units for the year ended december  and by  limited partner units for the year ended december  the net income allocated to the general partner decreased to for the year ended december  due to the decrease in available cash distributed to the general partner 
according to the agreement of limited partnership of tnclp  net income is allocated to the general partner and the limited partners in each taxable year in the same proportion that available cash for such taxable year was distributed to the general partner and the limited partners 
distributions of available cash are made to the limited partners and to the general partner  except that the general partner is entitled  as an incentive  to larger percentage interests to the extent that distributions of available cash exceed specified target levels  which were not met 
available cash for decreased million from due primarily to lower net income in partially offset by the elimination of the million reserve amount and to an increase in available cash as a result of the impact of tnclp s participation in an accounts receivable securitization facility 
capital resources and liquidity net cash provided by operating activities for was million  a decrease of million from  principally due to lower net income 
working capital decreased million primarily due to an increase of million in inventories  the result of substantially lower than anticipated sales  and an increase of million in accounts receivable offset by an increase of million in the amounts due to affiliates and a decrease of million in cash 
the partnership s principal needs for funds are to support its working capital requirements  distributions to partners  if any  and capital expenditures 
the partnership intends to fund such needs from net cash provided by operating activities  and  to the extent permitted thereunder  from funds available under the operating partnership s revolving credit facility 
at december  the operating partnership had million of unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility 
the partnership believes that such sources of funds will be adequate to meet the partnership s working capital needs  make quarterly distributions to partners  if any  and fund the partnership s capital expenditures during quarterly distributions to the partners of tnclp are based on available cash for the quarter as defined in the tnclp agreement of limited partnership 
available cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements  adjusted for changes in certain reserves established as the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary 
distributions paid to all partners were million in and million in distributions on the common units are cumulative to the extent that  for any calendar quarter  if a distribution of at least is not paid to the holders of the common units  the amount of the shortfall plus any arrearages from prior quarters will be paid out of available cash in subsequent quarters before any incentive distributions are paid to the general partner 
as of december   the accumulated distribution arrearage for the common units was million 
per unit 
the partnership s accumulated arrearage will likely increase by million 
per unit as no distributions were declared in early recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the partnership will adopt sfas effective january  at this time  the partnership has not determined the impact of sfas on its results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
year issue the year issue concerns computer programs that use only the last two digits to identify the year in date fields 
if not corrected  many of these computer applications could fail or create erroneous results near january  this issue affects virtually every company 
the partnership relies upon terra to provide management information systems services 
terra has assigned dedicated resources to address its year issues with a year steering committee providing management oversight and coordination 
the partnership has also published year information and disclosures on terra s website http www 
terraindustries 
com 
in general  management believes the state of readiness for the partnership is such that it will be ready for year issues on time 
terra s management information systems mis environment has been assessed for year issues and some remedial actions have been identified 
the cost of remedial actions for the mis area is not material to the partnership 
nearly all of these remedial actions are complete with minimal cost 
testing is substantially complete with minimal cost 
testing is substantially complete with the mainframe hardware systems and the associated software  with the exception of a few software packages originally purchased from third parties that are scheduled to be updated in terra recently completed an organization wide review of all possible computing functions  including the process control systems and instrumentation in the manufacturing facilities 
some remedial actions have been identified in a few areas and the cost of these remedial actions is not expected to be material to the partnership 
terra is also assessing year issues in relation to its customers  suppliers and other constituents because the action or inaction of third parties may materially affect the partnership 
an initial assessment of key third parties  including utility suppliers  has been completed and some follow up is ongoing 
although terra expects that there will be no significant adverse consequences relating to its year issues  the partnership believes its most reasonably likely worst case year scenario involves the interruption of its manufacturing facilities due to failed utility supplies or some other cause 
the partnership has in place contingency plans to deal with such interruptions  although restarting these facilities may be dependent on the resumption of utilities from sole source suppliers 
other general contingency planning efforts continue to be evaluated and refined for precautionary purposes 
terra anticipates that it will complete all assessment  remediation  testing  and contingency planning efforts for year issues in the third quarter of based on substantial completion of activities to date  the partnership anticipates that year issues  including the historical and estimated costs of remediation  will not have a material effect on its business  results of operations or financial condition 
however  the costs or consequences of incomplete or untimely resolution of year issues by the partnership or third parties could have a material adverse affect on the partnership 
forward looking precautions information contained in this report  other than historical information  may be considered forward looking 
forward looking information reflects management s current views of future events and financial performance that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  the following general economic conditions within the agricultural industry  competitive factors and pricing pressures principally  sales prices of nitrogen products and natural gas costs  changes in product mix  changes in the seasonality of demand patterns  changes in weather conditions  changes in agricultural regulations  and other risks detailed in the factors that affect operating results section of this discussion
