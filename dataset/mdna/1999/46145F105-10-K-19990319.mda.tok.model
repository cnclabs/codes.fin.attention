a decrease in specialist fees of and floor broker fees of  was offset by the volume increases in shares executed by specialists of and floor brokers of  resulting in a net increase in transaction processing expenses 
transaction processing as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in software royalties 
as software royalties are contractually fixed at of posit revenues  the increase is wholly attributable to an increase in posit revenues

consulting 
the increase in consulting expense is primarily due to costs incurred for accounting and financial research of international joint venture opportunities and a major telecommunication system conversion 
telecommunications and data processing services 
the increase in technological and data communications processing expenses stems primarily from the data feed upgrades for clients  primarily market data line connections  and expenses relating to a telecommunication network conversion and contingency planning 
net loss on long term investments 
the decrease in net loss on long term investments is due to income of million recognized from the sale of our equity ownership interest in the long view group  inc  offset by initial start up costs for itg europe of million and the combined costs of equity loss pick up and amortization of goodwill on itg australia of million and the longview group  inc  of million 
spin off costs 
the spin off expenses are attributable to our legal  accounting  consulting and other expenses incurred for the spin off transactions

income tax expense the increase in income tax expense is the result of an increase in pretax income and an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in the increase in the effective rate was due to certain non deductible expenses  such as goodwill amortization and spin off costs and the inability to offset international losses with united states profits in calculating income tax expense  that were not present in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues increased  or  from million to million

capitalized software development costs increased approximately million  primarily due to additional projects and an increase in staff engaged in software development 
compensation and employee benefits expenses per person decreased  or  from  to  transaction processing 
the increase in transactions processing expenses is primarily due to the expense associated with a higher volume of transactions and shares 
transaction processing expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from to  primarily from a shift in the business mix towards quantex and electronic trading desk services 
those products have slightly lower margins than posit due to charges for floor brokerage fees which are not incurred with the posit business 
software royalties 
as software royalties are contractually fixed at of posit revenues  the increase is wholly attributable to an increase in posit revenues 
occupancy and equipment 
the increase in occupancy and equipment expense is due primarily to relocation of our corporate headquarters from third avenue to madison avenue in mid june rent expense increased accordingly as the rental square footage increased by more than 
we also had to accelerate the write off of the unamortized leasehold improvements from the third avenue location 
in addition  depreciation expense increased approximately million as a result of purchases of additional equipment associated with both the move and increased headcount 
consulting 
consulting is primarily for functions  which we currently believe  are advantageous to out source 
the decrease is due primarily to our undertaking in nonrecurring special projects related to contingency planning and systems security 
telecommunications and data processing service 
the increase is due primarily to communications costs incurred in and relating to the posit joint venture  which were presented for payment in the second quarter of in addition  duplicate services were required for the third avenue and madison avenue locations in connection with the move of our headquarters 
net loss on long term investments 
the increase in the net loss on long term investments is due to the combined costs of equity loss pick up and amortization of goodwill on itg australia and the longview group  inc  of  and  respectfully 
other general and administrative expense 
the increase is largely attributable to the increase in headcount of employees 
related costs  primarily services provided by jefferies company  increased by approximately  travel and entertainment costs increased by approximately million primarily from an increased effort to promote our products 
legal fees increased by approximately  as a result of exploring several strategic initiatives and the costs associated with outsourcing legal services pending the hiring of a new in house general counsel

dependence on major customers during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenue 
during  revenue from our largest customers accounted for approximately of our total revenue while revenue from each of our three largest customers accounted for   and  respectively  of total revenue 
customers may discontinue use of our services at any time 
the loss of any significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the loss of significant posit customers could result in lower share volumes of securities offered through posit  which may adversely affect the liquidity of the system 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resource requirements are the result of the funding of working capital needs  primarily consisting of compensation  benefits and transaction processing fees and software royalty fees 
historically  all working capital requirements have been met by cash from operations 
a substantial portion of our assets is liquid  consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements 
we generally invest our excess cash in money market funds and other short term investments that generally mature within days or less 
additionally  securities owned  at fair value  include highly liquid  variable rate municipal securities  auction rate preferred stock and common stock 
at december   cash equivalents amounted to million and receivables from brokers  dealers and other of million were due within days 
we also invest a portion of our excess cash balances in cash enhanced strategies  which we believe should yield higher returns without any significant effect on risk 
as of december   we had an investment in an arbitrage fund 
the fund s strategy is to invest in a hedged portfolio of convertible securities 
this strategy seeks an enhanced level of capital appreciation by focusing on current income and capital appreciation 
at december   the amount of these investments was million 
historically  all regulatory capital needs of itg inc have been provided by cash from operations 
see business regulation 
we believe that cash flows from operations and the payment of the exercise price upon the exercise of expiring options will provide itg inc with sufficient regulatory capital 
on march   we entered into an agreement with a bank to borrow  effective upon the closing of the merger  up to million on a revolving basis to enable itg inc to satisfy its regulatory net capital requirements 
the commitment will expire on march  any amounts drawn may be prepaid at any time  but no later than march  we have agreed to pay an up front fee totaling of the commitment and will incur a fee at a rate per annum equal to on the daily amount of the unused commitment to march  the interest rate on any amounts drawn will be prime  if such amounts are not repaid within two weeks  the interest rate will increase to prime plus 
the credit facility is secured by a pledge of the stock of itg inc  itg ventures  inc 
and itg global trading incorporated 
this agreement limits our ability to pay cash dividends or incur indebtedness and requires us to comply with certain financial covenants 
assuming that the merger and related transactions will close on march   following payment of the special cash dividend we estimate that itg inc will have excess net regulatory capital of approximately million not including the million available under the new revolving credit facility 
although we believe that the combination of our existing net regulatory capital  operating cash flows and the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet regulatory capital requirements  a shortfall in net regulatory capital would have a material adverse effect on us 
in  we established a million credit line with a bank to fund temporary regulatory capital shortfalls encountered periodically by itg australia 
the lender charges us interest at the federal funds rate plus 
we lend amounts borrowed to the itg australia and charge interest at the federal funds rate plus 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under this bank credit line and no amounts were owed to us by the itg australia 
borrowings from the bank and loans to the itg australia will not be permitted during the period that the revolving credit agreement discussed above is effective 
effects of inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate levels of inflation which have been experienced in north america in recent years have had a significant effect on our revenue or profitability 
however  high inflation may lead to higher interest rates which might cause investment funds to move from equity securities to debt securities or cash equivalents 
the year issue some computer systems and software products were originally designed to accept only two digit entries in the data code field 
as a result  certain computer systems and software packages will not be able to interpret dates beyond december  and thus will interpret dates beginning january  incorrectly 
this could potentially result in computer failure or miscalculations  causing operating disruptions  including an inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in normal business operations 
therefore  companies may have to upgrade or replace computer and software systems in order to comply with the year requirements 
strategy we are well aware of and are actively addressing the year issue and the potential problems that can arise in any computer and software system 
planning and evaluation work began in including the identification of those systems affected 
we established a year working group to address the year issue 
we have targeted our efforts into three major areas vendors  company proprietary products  and clients 
vendors 
our ability to successfully meet the year challenge is in part dependent on our vendors 
we have contacted our vendors to determine the status of their year programs and have created a database recording each vendor s readiness status 
over of our vendors have responded that their systems are currently year compliant  and substantially all of our vendors have indicated that they expect their systems to be year compliant by september  based upon the results of our testing to date  we are satisfied with the representations we have received from our vendors 
we are in the process of integrating year compliant versions of our vendors software and hardware with our proprietary products 
company proprietary products 
we have evaluated our trading systems and have endeavored to examine all code contained in our internally produced software 
we have completed regression testing of all mission critical systems and released year compliant versions of all such systems other than quantex 
we plan to complete date forward testing of all mission critical systems and release a year compliant version of quantex by the end of june we also intend to participate in the securities industry association s industry wide testing program in clients 
we sent a letter explaining our year strategy to all clients in july in addition  we contacted clients on a project by project basis to ascertain compatibility between our systems and changes made to the clients systems 
we plan to provide point to point testing opportunities for our clients starting in april year contingency planning we are in the early stages of establishing a year contingency plan to deal with both internal and external failures of critical systems 
the year issue can affect all businesses that rely heavily on automated systems 
our year contingency plan is therefore intended to address failures of internal systems  client connections and connections to trading destinations  as well as failures of major infrastructure components 
we intend to have our contingency plan in place by july and to update and refine such plan as needed on a continuing basis 
we believe  however  that such contingency plan will not provide satisfactory solutions for our worst case scenario the general failure of computer and communication systems relied upon by the securities industry  such as the systems provided by long distance telephone companies  the stock exchanges  nasdaq  the depository trust company and adp brokerage services  and the failure of jefferies company and w d to provide services under their clearing and execution agreement with us 
such failure would prevent us from operating in whole or in part until such systems or services have been restored and could have a material adverse effect on us 
in the event any of our internally developed systems fails  we will undertake to remediate such system on an emergency basis at the time of such failure 
to ensure that adequate staff will be available to handle any such emergencies in january of  we have imposed a moratorium on employee vacations during the first two weeks of january  and have made arrangements to have a number of software development personnel normally based in our culver city office at our new york headquarters during the final week of december and the first week of january our inability to remediate a failure of any of our internally developed mission critical systems would prevent us from operating in whole or in part until such systems have been restored and could have a material adverse effect on us 
costs we do not believe that the costs incurred to ready our systems for the year will have a material effect on our financial condition 
total costs for the whole project are estimated to be between and million  which includes the cost of personnel  consultants and software and hardware costs 
through december   we had spent approximately million on the year project 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas requires that public business enterprises report certain information about operating segments in complete sets of financial statements of the enterprise and in condensed financial statements of interim periods issued to shareholders 
it also requires that these enterprises report certain information about their products and services  the geographical areas in which they operate  and their major customers 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although earlier application was permitted 
the disclosure requirements of this standard were not applicable since the company manages its operations through a single line of business institutional agency trade executions 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
it identifies the characteristics of internal use software and provides examples to assist in determining when the computer software is for internal use 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   although earlier application is encouraged  and should be applied to internal use computer software costs incurred in those fiscal years for all projects  including those in progress upon initial application of this sop 
we do not anticipate that the implementation of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
jefferies group and itgi plan to separate into two independent companies on march   we announced that we were planning the separation of jefferies company and other jefferies group subsidiaries from our company through a series of transactions  including a special cash dividend  the transfer of jefferies group s assets and liabilities other than those related to our company  a spin off and a merger 
upon the consummation of the spin off and upstream merger and the related transactions  the stockholders of jefferies group will be stockholders of our company and jefferies group will cease to be our parent company 
first  the company will pay a special cash dividend of per share  payable pro rata to all of our stockholders of record on april   including jefferies group 
the aggregate amount of the special cash dividend will be up to million  of which we will pay million to jefferies group 
following the payment of the special cash dividend  jefferies group will transfer all of its assets other than its approximately equity interest in our company and all of its liabilities other than liabilities related to our company to a new company new jefferies 
after such transfers have been completed and certain other conditions have been satisfied  jefferies group will distribute all of the outstanding common stock of new jefferies pro rata to jefferies group stockholders 
the spin off will be followed immediately by a tax free merger of our company into jefferies group  with our public shareholders receiving shares of jefferies group 
jefferies group will then be renamed investment technology group  inc new itgi 
based on the number of shares of jefferies group common stock expected to be outstanding on the date of the spin off and upstream merger approximately  and the number of shares of our common stock held by jefferies group  our public stockholders other than jefferies group will receive approximately shares of common stock of new itgi for each share of our common stock held by them 
the spin off and upstream merger and the related transactions are contingent on a number of factors  including receipt of all board of directors and shareholder approvals of jefferies group and our company and other required regulatory and contractual approvals 
the spin off and upstream merger and the related transactions are expected to close in april item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk none
