forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company and the industries in which it operates 
in addition  other written or oral statements which constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on behalf of the company 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions future factors which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors include increasing competition by foreign and domestic competitors  including new entrants  substantial reliance on mecar s principal customers to continue to acquire mecar s products on a regular basis  the cyclical nature of the company s military business  rapid technological developments and changes and the company s ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  the ability of the company to successfully continue its transition from a pure defense firm to a firm with a substantial commercial component  the mix of products services  the achievement of lower costs and expenses  domestic and foreign governmental fiscal affairs and public policy changes which may affect the level of purchases made by customers  changes in environmental and other domestic and foreign governmental regulations  continued availability of financing  financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support the company s future business 
the principal current future factor affecting mecar s business is the continuing impact of depressed oil prices on its principal customers 
these are representative of the future factors that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
in addition  such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general domestic and international economic conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other future factors 
trends in operations allied had one of its most profitable years in mecar turned in another solid performance in it contributed approximately of allied s revenues 
while the vast majority of such revenues resulted from products supplied to mecar s principal customers  mecar received a modest contract award from a new customer in which could lead to substantial follow on awards 
mecar has also negotiated the terms of a contract with another new customer  however this contract has not yet been awarded 
mecar s performance slowed in the fourth quarter of as a result of the lack of current orders from mecar s principal customers 
the last substantial contract received by mecar from its principal customers was received in march  allied believes that depressed oil prices  which adversely impact the purchasing power of such customers  is the principal reason for the delay in receipt of orders from such customers 
notwithstanding the continued depressed state of oil prices  mecar has been in active negotiations with the principal customers for a new contract 
mecar anticipates an award of this contract in the second quarter of  however there can be no assurance as to the receipt of such an award 
allied is optimistic that continued orders will be placed by such principal customers 
in addition to follow on orders for ammunition for various weapons systems currently owned by such customers  these customers are in the process of acquiring two new weapons systems via the foreign military sales program fms 
mecar has received and completed an initial contract for ammunition for one of these systems 
this ammunition is in the process of being tested by the us government and mecar is in negotiations with the us government for a follow on contract for additional rounds of such ammunition 
mecar has engaged in preliminary discussions with respect to an initial order for ammunition for the second new weapons system 
it is currently anticipated that mecar will receive a contract for such an initial order during and anticipates receipt of substantial ammunition orders over a several year period following successful completion of testing of the ammunition supplied for these new weapons systems 
given the several month delay in the recognition of revenue from the time of receipt of a contract due to the ramp up time and the delay in receipt of raw materials following the placement of orders therefor  the company anticipates a substantial slow down in mecar s revenue beginning at the end of the first quarter of if substantial contracts are received in the near future  the reduced contribution by mecar may be limited to the next few quarters 
further  mecar utilized all of its tax loss carry forwards in and therefore will be subject to belgian tax on any earnings 
the vsk group had a record year in it contributed approximately in revenues and in profits 
thus  the vsk group contributed approximately of allied s profits on only of allied s revenues 
while all lines of business increased in  the vsk group s results were enhanced by a project for an integrated security system installed in a large hotel complex outside of the vsk group s traditional service territory 
this project is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of allied expects the vsk group to provide another excellent year in  although it may not reach levels 
in addition to the one time hotel project  the vsk group expects a temporary downturn in its bank business in one of its principal bank customers is in the process of merging with another bank and has advised the vsk group that it will discontinue the installation of further security systems until the merged entity determines which bank branches it will continue to operate and which will be closed 
notwithstanding these matters  the vsk group has a substantial backlog of orders and good prospects for additional work 
in  the vsk group established dealer relationships in the united kingdom and in germany  two of the fastest growing european markets for security services and products 
the vsk group expects to continue to expand into these markets 
in addition  allied and the vsk group are actively seeking to grow the vsk group by acquisition 
an active acquisition search is in process 
the internal expansion of the vsk group s business and its growth by acquisition are being pursued to further increase allied s non defense business with the twin goals of having i a larger commercial business base to reduce the volatility of allied s defense business and ii a sufficient commercial component of revenues and profits to cause the investment community to cease valuing allied stock solely as a defense company 
bri s profitability was based in large part on revenues from a large contract for the benefit of a foreign government 
this contract is scheduled for completion in mid in  bri entered into several teaming arrangements with us based firms to pursue both domestic and international business 
in  bri began to receive certain contract awards from such arrangements 
it is anticipated that bri s future prospects will depend in large part on the success of such teaming arrangements and its ability to secure other large contracts 
allied commenced with a consolidated backlog of approximately compared with a consolidated backlog at the beginning of of mecar began with a backlog of approximately compared with a beginning backlog of vsk began with a backlog of approximately compared with a beginning backlog of approximately bri s beginning backlog in was compared with a beginning backlog of the future prospects for allied depend largely on mecar s ability to continue to obtain large orders on a periodic basis and allied s ability to successfully continue its expansion of its commercial business 
trends in liquidity and capital resources allied s liquidity has improved in the last few years as a result of its profitable operations 
no liquidity problems are forecast for in the longer term  allied s liquidity will continue to depend upon its ability to obtain substantial orders from its traditional customer base and the success of its efforts to broaden its revenue base 
year issues allied is addressing a broad range of issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is complex  as many computer systems will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
the year issue creates risks for allied from unforeseen problems in its products or its own computer and embedded systems and from third parties with whom allied deals on financial and other transactions worldwide 
failure of allied s and or third parties computer systems could have a material impact on allied s ability to conduct its business 
allied has commenced a phased program to inventory  assess  remediate  test  implement and develop contingency plans for all mission critical applications and products potentially affected by the year issue the yk program 
to accelerate overall completion  activities in each phase are often concurrent rather than serial  but all phases  except developing contingency plans  are expected to be completed by mid allied s current estimate of the aggregate costs to be incurred for the yk program is less than  which is expected to be funded from operating cash flows 
if allied encounters significant unforeseen year problems  either in its products or internal business systems or in relation to third party vendors  manufacturers or suppliers  actual costs could materially exceed this estimate 
allied has substantially completed its inventory of year impacted software and is assessing its centralized computer and embedded systems to identify any potential year issues 
allied has a number of projects underway to replace or upgrade hardware and software that are known to be year non compliant 
allied currently expects to substantially complete remediation  validation  and implementation of its internal systems by mid however  if implementation of replacement or upgraded systems or software is delayed  or if significant new non compliance issues are identified  allied s results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
allied is also in the process of contacting its critical suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and other vendors to determine that the operations  products and services that they provide to allied are year compliant 
where practicable  allied will attempt to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of third parties to be year ready  including developing contingency plans 
however  such failures  including failures of any contingency plan  remain a possibility and could have a materially adverse impact on allied s results of operations or financial condition 
allied is in the process of developing contingency plans to address situations that may result if allied is unable to achieve year readiness of its critical operations  including operations under the control of third parties 
additionally  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
completion of such contingency plans is in progress and is expected to be completed by september there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop contingency plans that will adequately address all year issues that may arise 
liquidity 
allied s liquidity increased in  principally as a result of profitable operations at each operating segment 
working capital  which includes restricted cash  was approximately at december   which is an increase of from the december  level 
allied s current working capital is required for operations and to support credit facility agreements 
cash and equivalents at december  increased over year end levels largely due to the profitable operations of the operating segments 
restricted cash increased over year end amounts due to an increased level of work in process at mecar 
accounts receivable at december  decreased from december  by due to unusually large shipments of products at the end of costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts increased by over as a result of larger amounts of work in progress at the end of which is anticipated to be completed and shipped in the first quarter of inventories decreased by from levels due to the increase in contracts in progress and the reduced backlog 
prepaid expenses increased by over levels corresponding to the increase in contracts in progress which are scheduled to be shipped in the first quarter of current liabilities increased slightly from levels 
during  and  allied funded its operations principally with internally generated cash and back up credit facilities required for foreign government contracts 
except for modest lines of credit to support certain of its operations  allied s ability to cover its anticipated future operating and capital requirements is dependent upon its ability to generate positive cash flow from operations 
given the relative size of the operations of its subsidiaries  allied s continued ability to generate sufficient cash flow remains dependent principally upon the operations of mecar and the vsk group 
mecar typically obtains relatively large orders for its ammunition and weapon systems which require credit facilities to provide import letters of credit  advance payment guarantees and performance bonds 
these needs have been met in the last few years via agreements with a multi member foreign bank pool 
the current credit facility was revised in as has been the case in recent years  the bank pool must agree to extend such facility to new orders as they are received by mecar 
while management believes that it will be able to finance additional mecar contracts using the bank pool structure  there can be no assurance that such financing will be provided 
the credit facility and other loan agreements continue to impose certain restrictions on mecar 
mecar s obligations were collateralized at december  by base cash deposits of and a pledge on mecar s assets of the bank agreement further precludes mecar from making payments to any company in the allied group in excess of per year until mecar has unrestricted cash of not less than mecar s obligations under the bank agreement are also supported by a guarantee provided by allied 
mecar has a mortgage loan with a foreign bank which had an outstanding balance of approximately at december  principal and interest payments on the mortgage loan extend through january  the vsk group operated throughout primarily from cash generated from operations 
the vsk group is obligated on several mortgages and other long term obligations with december  balances aggregating it is also obligated on letters of credit required by a contract with a customer 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
based on a preliminary assessment  allied does not believe the conversion will have a material impact on the competitiveness of its products or increase the likelihood of contract cancellations 
further  allied expects that modifications to comply with euro requirements have been and will continue to be made in its business operations and systems on a timely basis and does not believe that the cost of such modifications will have a material adverse impact on allied s results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that allied will be able to continue to complete such modifications on a timely basis  any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on allied s results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  allied faces risks to the extent that suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and other vendors upon whom allied relies and their suppliers are unable to make appropriate modifications to support euro transactions 
the inability of such third parties to support euro transactions could have a material adverse effect on allied s results of operations or financial condition 
bri operated throughout from cash generated from operations supplemented by a credit facility 
the credit facility consisted of a line of credit  which was increased to in the latter portion of as well as a cash collateralized letter of credit facility 
at december   the line of credit had an outstanding balance of 
allied has guaranteed bri s obligations under the above described credit facility 
principally in order to finance bri s principal contract for the benefit of a foreign government  allied advanced approximately million to bri in the third and fourth quarters of the inter company loan 
in early  bri obtained a new credit facility consisting of a line of credit which permits advances based upon bri eligible accounts receivable and unbilled work in process 
bri has used a portion of its line of credit to repay a substantial portion of the inter company loan 
in september  allied s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of allied s common stock 
to date  the company has made very modest repurchases under the share repurchase program 
the timing and size of any future stock repurchases are subject to market conditions  stock prices allied s cash position and other cash requirements going forward 
capital resources 
allied spent in on capital equipment as compared with in and in  respectively 
the expenditures in were primarily for facility upgrades and computer equipment 
management currently anticipates that it will spend approximately on capital expenditures in  principally for additional upgrades to the mecar and vsk facilities and equipment

mecar s pre tax profit increased by over pre tax profits due to a substantial increase of revenue in from mecar s traditional customer base  including the systems integration contract 
the vsk group s pre tax profit increased by from its pre tax profit principally due to a substantial increase in vsk group revenue in the pre tax profit of the vsk group increased by over the pre tax profit as a result of higher profit margins and the implementation of cost containment measures at the vsk group in bri s pre tax profit remained substantially unchanged throughout the period 
income taxes the effective tax rate was  primarily due to the utilization of tax loss carryforwards at mecar and the reduction of in deferred and accrued tax obligations in the united kingdom that were favorably resolved in the foreign operating loss carryforwards at mecar were fully utilized in and some mecar earnings became subject to belgian tax at the statutory rate 
the effective tax rate was primarily due to the utilization of tax loss carryforwards at mecar

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
allied manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at year end  allied had approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness and approximately million of variable rate indebtedness 
allied has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in days or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end variable rate debt and cash available for investment  a one percent change in interest rates would impact net interest income by less than  exchange rate sensitivity 
allied conducts business in several foreign countries and approximately  and  of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  was derived from allied s operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
allied uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates associated with some  but not all  of its contracts in which the expenses for providing services are incurred in currency other than the functional currency of allied s foreign subsidiaries or payments on contracts are made by the customer in another currency 
the objective of these contracts is to hedge fixed obligations to reduce the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on allied s foreign subsidiaries operating results 
additionally  allied s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the allied subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
allied does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by less than million 
allied does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does allied hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
allied regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program
