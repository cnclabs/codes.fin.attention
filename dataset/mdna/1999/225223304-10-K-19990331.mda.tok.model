item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preliminary note regarding forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  and is subject to the safe harbor created by that section 
factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are set forth in this section and under business risk factors 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview we had an accumulated net loss of approximately million as of december  our funding through the end of has been primarily from the sale of approximately million of securities  research funding from the defense advanced research projects agency darpa of approximately million  and revenue of approximately million 
we have experienced net losses in each year of operations and expect to incur substantial further losses until we make additional sales  and possibly thereafter 
in april  we recognized our first revenue from product sales with our delivery of a two processor mta system to the san diego supercomputer center sdsc 
we upgraded the mta system at sdsc in december to four processors 
this larger system was accepted by sdsc in january and we will recognize the revenue from that delivery in the first quarter of assuming receipt of purchase orders  we plan to upgrade the mta system in sdsc in stages to larger configurations as we receive production printed circuit boards  integrated circuits and other components that we integrate into a commercially acceptable system 
see business risk factors development status of the mta system and business strategy 
we generally recognize revenue from sales of mta systems upon acceptance of the system by the customer  revenue from the maintenance of the mta system ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement and service revenue as services are performed 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
we had revenue in of approximately million  up from  in revenues included million from the sale of the two processor mta system to sdsc  our first revenue from product sales 
we had  of service revenue in  up from  in service revenue in both years was pursuant to a subcontract with sdsc to evaluate multithreaded architecture for certain defense applications 
we expect to complete this subcontract for another  in  of which our portion  after payments to our subcontractors  will be approximately  this contract expires on june  we also anticipate receiving revenue in from sales of larger configurations to sdsc and from other sales to potential customers in  although we currently have no contracts or purchase orders for such sales 
see business risk factors 
operating expenses 
cost of revenue from product sales was high in and as a percentage of the revenue due to favorable pricing terms provided to sdsc and the inclusion of costs of system infrastructure to support a full proocessor mta system 
the cost of service revenue in was of service revenue  an increase from in  due to increased billings from our subcontractors 
research and development expenses constitute the largest portion of our operating expenses  and include costs associated with the development of the mta system  including personnel expense  depreciation and lease expense on facilities and equipment  nonrecurring engineering  software and hardware costs and preproduction expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  a increase  and to million in  a further increase 
research and development expenses for included a  charge as compensation expense related to certain performance based stock options  without that charge  research and development expenditures would have been approximately million 
salaries  benefits and allocated overhead for research and development increased from million in  to million in excluding the compensation expense for performance based stock options and to million in  largely reflecting additional personnel and higher wages in both and engineering expenses  consisting of payments to third parties for services and products  were million in  million in and million in the decline of approximately million in engineering expenses from to was largely due to lower expenditures on the mta prototype  which decreased from million in to  in and essentially ceased after the third quarter of in  we spent nearly million on further engineering expenses on the current mta implementation  compared to million in we also spent approximately million in and million in on the conversion from gallium arsenide integrated circuits to cmos integrated circuits  primarily for design services from cadence design services  inc our preproduction costs and expense related to adjustments in inventory valuation and reserves have increased from practically nothing in to million in and million in  reflecting our acquisition of inventory and transition to a production company 
from time to time during the development process of the mta system  we have been required to redesign certain components because of previously unforeseen design flaws 
for example  various processor and network chip technologies we thought were functional across multiple configurations have subsequently been discovered to require additional design features to function as intended and to achieve a fully operational system scalable to multiple processors 
this has led to significant downward inventory adjustments  including approximately million in and million in preproduction costs also include variances from our standard costs  including expense from revaluating our inventory because of increased production yields  which were  in and  in  and costs of purchasing various materials which are not capitalized as inventory  which were  in and million in while we expect that research and development expenditures will continue to be a major expense  they are expected to decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses and will generally include expenditures related to continuing engineering of the mta system  research and development related to the next generation mta system and related software development  including personnel expense  depreciation and lease expense on facilities and equipment 
marketing and sales expense has increased from  in to million in and to over million in  as we have continued to increase sales and customer support staff and expenditures in connection with sales and marketing  benchmarks and development of third party applications software 
in  marketing and sales expenses increased to of total operating expenses  up from in  with a significant increase in the fourth quarter as we then opened a two person  branch sales office in japan and added a third us salesperson 
with the impact of these expenses for all of plus additional sales support personnel during the year  marketing and sales expenses increased by over  constituting of total operating expense 
we expect that we will continue to increase our marketing and sales activities as we build larger mta systems for sale to industrial and commercial customers 
our general and administrative expenses have increased each year consistent with expansion of our infrastructure 
these expenses were nearly million in  nearly million in and over million in  an increase of in over and a further increase in over the increase in expenditures in over was primarily due to additional staff and further increases in legal  investor relations  stock transfer and other costs associated with being a publicly owned company 
the increase in these expenses for over was due largely to higher wages and operating costs associated with being a publicly owned company 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase commensurate with any growth in our operations 
research funding 
we have been billing darpa under a million research contract awarded in september billings increased in to  over  in  and then declined to  in there remains approximately  to be billed under this contract  which expires in september other income expense 
other income increased by  in to  as interest income increased from  to  while interest expense declined from  to  reflecting the company s increased cash position due to the sales of equity securities throughout the year 
we increased other income by another  in primarily due to increasing interest income to  due to our increased cash position after completion of a million financing in december and other financings in  which was offset in part by interest expense of  largely due to a fully utilized lease line of credit 
taxes 
we made no provision for federal income taxes in  or as we have continued to incur net operating losses 
as of december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which expire in years through  if not utilized 
our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other tax attributes including its research credit of approximately million at december  would be limited to an annual utilization for losses and credits for periods prior to of approximately  this limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
preferred stock 
we amortized a total of million related to the conversions of our series b and series c convertible preferred stock during into common stock at a discount from the fair market value of the common stock  and recorded dividends of  on these securities  almost all of which were paid in shares of our common stock  based on the market price at the time of payment 
in december  we issued  of its series a convertible preferred stock  and recorded a preferred stock discount of approximately  from the allocation of proceeds to warrants issued with the series a convertible preferred stock 
in  we paid all of the  of dividends on our outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock  issued in june  in shares of common stock  based on the market price at the time of payment 
in addition we amortized in the third quarter the preferred stock discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to warrants issued in connection with the series b convertible preferred stock  which resulted in another  non cash charge to the loss for common stock 
year issues relating to the year result from many computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  so that the year may be interpreted as the year rather than a related issue is the ability to recognize the year as a leap year 
software programs and embedded microcircuitry that have date sensitive features may have year issues 
these programs may include software tools that we use in the development of the hardware and operating systems of our mta system  the software programs and embedded chips used in our internal systems and software programs and equipment used in the normal operation of our business 
in addition  key suppliers may have issues relating to the year that could affect their ability to provide needed products and services 
we are conducting a formal review of our products  our internal network system  the hardware and software tools we are using and our key suppliers regarding the potential impact on us regarding year issues 
the review is being conducted by representatives from our finance  manufacturing  engineering  purchasing and systems administration departments 
we believe there is no significant exposure relating to our mta system and its unix based operating system 
we expect that our formal review will be largely completed as to other matters by the end of the second quarter of based upon the responses to date and informal inquiries  we believe no significant modifications to our internal network or computer systems are necessary to address year issues 
we installed a materials requirement planning ii system in that complies with year issues 
we have received assurances that the services provided at our new offices in seattle are year compliant  except for one system that our landlord has agreed to remedy 
our review is ongoing with respect to our other internal systems and the various software development tools we use 
we are making inquiries of our suppliers and service providers to obtain assurances concerning their year compliance and their ability to continue to provide products and services to us which are year compliant 
we have assumed that basic public utilities will continue to be available to us after january   and are not aware of any information to the contrary 
to date we have not identified any material deficiencies or remediation requirements and have not budgeted for any remediation costs or costs associated with responding to other parties year noncompliance 
the company does not separately track the internal costs for its year review  and current and future anticipated costs are expected to include only payroll and related costs for the employees engaged in the review 
we are reevaluating these positions periodically as we continue our review 
at this point we cannot predict the effect of the year issues on our suppliers or the resulting effect on us 
we have not yet developed a contingency plan of operating in the event that critical systems of vendors  suppliers or other third parties are not year compliant  or that the software development tools  software programs and equipment we use internally are not year compliant 
we plan on completing a contingency plan once our inquiries are completed and to have a contingency plan in place by the end of the third quarter of if any of our critical systems are not in fact year compliant or if critical suppliers from whom we obtain products and services are not year compliant  then year issues could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in through december   our principal sources of liquidity have been net proceeds from the sale of equity totaling million  darpa research funding and subcontracts totaling million and sales receipts of approximately million 
at december   we had million in cash and had no bank line of credit 
during  we spent almost million of cash on operating activities  up from million in during  our operating activity expenses will depend primarily upon personnel costs  the cost of inventory and third party engineering expenses related to future implementations of the mta system  primarily the conversion to cmos technology 
our overall wages and benefits increased from million in to million in  while total expenses related to inventory  including inventory additions and scrap  increased in to approximately million  a million increase over we expect that personnel costs will continue to increase in  although not as rapidly as in and as we have slowed the growth of personnel pending the receipt of additional sales orders 
similarly  we expect inventory costs to decrease in  since we plan only modest inventory additions pending receipt of purchase orders 
in  we incurred third party engineering expenses related to the cmos implementation of the mta system of million and we expect those expenditures to increase in in  our investing activity consisted of additional property  plant and equipment of over million  of which million was spent on computer and electronic test equipment   on leasehold improvements and  on computer software 
in  we raised approximately million through the sale of securities  primarily through sales of million preferred stock and common stock in private placements and stock option and warrant exercises for the balance 
we believe that in addition to our current funds and revenue from anticipated sales of mta systems  we will need to raise at least million in equity and debt financings in to meet our contractual commitments  which principally consist of operating leases and licenses for software tools and third party engineering services pertaining to the cmos implementation of our mta system  and to continue our present level of business activities in and beyond 
see business risk factors additional shares issuable by us would dilute existing shareholdings and could hinder our ability to obtain additional financing 
the company is seeking a lease line of credit for capital goods for up to million 
if we were unable to raise the necessary funds  then we would delay inventory purchases  reduce third party engineering services and reduce personnel 
we believe that we will be cash flow positive once we have sales receipts of approximately million per quarter  we do not anticipate such level of sales prior to  if then 
in certain circumstances  the holders of our series b convertible perferred stock and common stock with adjustment rights could demand that we repurchase such shares 
these circumstances generally relate to the inability of such holders to sell their shares in market transactions  material defaults by us in performing under the relevant transaction documents  a merger or consolidation resulting in a change of control and an inability by us  as a result of applicable nasdaq rules  to issue all the shares of common stock that the holders would be entitled 
if the event giving rise to this repurchase obligation was not within our sole control  such as a decline in the market price of our common stock  then we could elect not to repurchase these shares 
to the extent that the events giving rise to any such repurchase obligation are within our control  we plan to conduct our operations so as not cause any event that would give rise to a repurchase obligation 
if the event giving rise to any such repurchase obligation is within our control  we likely would be unable to repurchase any shares delivered to us for repurchase absent receipt of additional capital 
we would be subject to certain penalties for failure to repurchase any such shares in these circumstances 
see note of the notes to financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 
in the first quarter of  we raised over million in equity and debt financings  and an investor has an option to invest another million later this year 
we will require further additional working capital if anticipated sales of the mta system are substantially delayed 
we plan to raise additional equity capital in  even if revenues are received from sales of mta systems when anticipated  in order to enhance our financial position for future operations 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms when needed or  if available  will be available on satisfactory terms or that such financings will not be dilutive to our shareholders 
see business risk factors additional shares issuable by us would dilute existing shareholdings and could hinder our ability to obtain additional financing
