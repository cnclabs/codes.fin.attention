capital calls related to investments to be made by the company s joint ventures are also subject to the company s approval of such investments 
item amount undrawn abbey credit facility commitment million undrawn safeguard credit facility commitment million undrawn wellsford whitehall equity commitment million undrawn creamer vitale wellsford equity commitment million undrawn liberty hampshire spfc jv equity commitment million inflation substantially all of wellsford capital s and wellsford whitehall s office leases provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measures 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
a substantial majority of the leases at the company s multifamily properties are for a term of one year or less which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or re letting of apartment units 
such short term leases generally minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
approximately of the company s investments in debt securities bear interest at floating rates or have remaining terms to maturity of less than one year 
as such  the company expects the rates of interest earned to increase in the event of high inflation 
year the company has developed a plan to modify its information technology  primarily its accounting software  to recognize the year the company currently expects the project to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of at a cost of less than million which will be funded from operations  including costs incurred to date 
the company does not expect this project to have a significant effect on its operations 
the timing and cost of this project will be closely monitored and are based on management s best estimates 
actual results  however  could differ from those anticipated 
the company also has initiated discussions with its third party property management companies the managers to ensure that those parties have appropriate plans to allay any year issues that may impact the company s operations 
these issues would include both accounting management software and non information technology it systems such as fire safety  security and elevator systems 
wellsford whitehall has completed its analysis of such systems and has determined that no material adverse consequences will likely result from its year issues 
wellsford capital and wellsford development have initiated such analysis  which is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of under the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  wherein the managers fail to update their software and non it systems  the company has the ability to convert its accounting and management systems to a spreadsheet based system on a temporary basis and to utilize its building engineers to manually override any non it systems which fail 
while the company believes its planning efforts are adequate to address its year concerns  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems and operations rely  primarily its banks  payroll processing company  creditors  and debtors  will be converted on a timely basis and will not have a material effect on the company 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be one appropriate measure of the performance of real estate companies because it is predicated on a cash flow analysis  as opposed to a measure predicated on generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which gives effect to non cash items such as depreciation 
ffo  for the company s purposes  represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures  and reflects gains or losses from the sale of real estate assets included in the company s consolidated net income since the strategic sale of such assets is integral to the company s operations 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs

h the fair value of this mortgage is considered to be its carrying amount since it is similar in both terms and collateral to the red canyon mortgage which reflects current market conditions see i below i the fair value of this mortgage is considered to be its carrying amount as it is a recently executed transaction reflective of current market conditions 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by offsetting its investments and financing exposures as well as by strategically timing and structuring its transactions 
the company has invested in million of libor based debt instruments and has obtained million of libor based financing as of december  the company has invested in million of fixed rate debt instruments and has obtained million of fixed rate financing as of december  these exposures substantially offset one another 
the company believes that its net exposure to both libor based and fixed rate instruments is minimal because interest rates are currently near historical lows and increases in interest rates would be beneficial to the company s net exposures  subject to credit risk
