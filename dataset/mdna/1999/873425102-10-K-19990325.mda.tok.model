comparable stores sales for the first six months of fiscal decreased  while comparable store sales for the last six months of the year decreased only 
management attributes much of the decline during the first six months to unfavorable weather conditions  significant declines in the colorado market which was closed in november  and a promotional strategy which highlighted higher priced  premium products in an intensely price competitive landscape 
this strategy was changed during the second half of the year to a promotional strategy which continually highlights various meals at a competitive price

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management made the decision to close the seven restaurants in its colorado market 
the company committed substantial resources to this market during in an attempt to reverse trends of poor sales and losses 
the desired results from the implementation of the plan were not achieved and the decision to close the market was made 
these seven restaurants had total sales of approximately million and operating losses of million during the approximately eleven months of that they were in operation 
additionally  the company continued to experience unfavorable sales trends during  concluding the year with comparable restaurant sales declining 
however  during the first six months of  comparable restaurant sales declined 
this trend compelled management to continue its evaluation of the operating model of the company 
during this evaluation  management concluded that certain volumes must be achieved in order to operate individual restaurants in accordance with company standards 
these standards include food quality  cleanliness  speed of service  and profitability 
management reviewed all existing restaurants to determine which restaurants could not reasonably be expected to achieve these volume levels  generally annual revenues of at least million 
this led to the decision to close an additional ten restaurants 
due to the significance of the closures described above  management performed an evaluation of the recoverability of all remaining assets as described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas 
management concluded from the results of this evaluation that a significant impairment of intangible as well as long lived assets was required to be recognized 
the impairment was reflective of a market value determined to be less than the carrying value of approximately restaurants  of which were acquired 
the assets were tested for impairment by projecting cash flows for individual restaurants based on recent results and trends specific to that restaurant 
the undiscounted projected cash flows for each restaurant were compared to the carrying value for that restaurant  including allocated goodwill  where applicable 
if the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value  an impairment was deemed to have occurred 
the amount of the impairment was determined by calculating the difference between the present value of the projected cash flows and the carrying value attributable to the specific restaurant 
the cash flows were discounted using the rate of return the company utilizes for approving new restaurant construction 
such discounted cash flows are  in management s opinion  the best estimate of the assets current value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future discounted cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from management s estimates 
the process described above resulted in the company s recording a special charge during the fourth quarter of of million pre tax  million after tax  or per share 
this amount had the following components 
impairment of intangible assets of million and impairment of long lived assets of million for restaurants that will continue in operation  based on the fas analysis described above  
a provision of million for the closure of seventeen restaurants  including all of the restaurants in the colorado market 
the amount was determined in accordance with fas and was comprised of 
million for the carrying value of the assets  net of estimated proceeds of million for the sale of restaurant properties  
million to record the estimated lease related obligations for closed restaurants 
this amount was determined as the lesser of the present value of the monthly lease commitments  net of expected sublease receipts  or lease termination provisions  
 for severance and relocation benefits paid to employees displaced by the restaurant closures  
 for the probable settlement of a franchisee lawsuit related to the colorado market 

the write off of other assets totaling  during  the seventeen restaurants contributed a total of million in sales  and had operating losses totaling million 
in addition  the total amount of depreciation and amortization recorded during relating to assets which were impaired was approximately million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income and interest capitalized on construction costs  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the difference was due to lower interest expense due to a decrease in the average debt outstanding during compared to  a reduction in interest income and an increase in interest capitalized on construction cost 
the company earned  of interest income during  compared to  of interest income earned during the the decrease was due to a reduction in short term investments 
in addition the company capitalized  of interest during no interest was capitalized during net income loss and net income loss per share 
the company recorded a net loss of  for compared to net income of  for net loss per share was for compared to net income per share of in the loss recorded in includes special charges totaling million pretax million after tax  or per share 
excluding these charges  the company would have reported net income of million equal to per share in fiscal net income in included charges totaling million pretax million after tax  or cents per share 
excluding these charges  the company would have reported net income of million equal to per share for fiscal disregarding these charges  management believes that the decrease in income was largely due to declining sales  and increased labor and marketing expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has financed business and expansion activities by using funds generated from operating activities  build to suit leases  equity financing  short and long term debt and capital leases 
the company currently maintains credit facilities totaling million  including a million unsecured revolving line of credit 
as of march   approximately million had been used under these commitments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million for net cash used in investing activities was million for  representing the construction of nine company owned restaurants  the reimaging of twenty seven restaurants and capital expenditures for improvements to existing restaurants 
this was offset by the sale of assets generating million in proceeds 
this compared to million for  representing primarily capital expenditures for improvements to existing restaurants  the construction of five free standing and two non traditional restaurants  and the conversion of two sombrero rosa and two two pesos restaurants to the taco cabana concept 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for representing primarily net borrowings under the company s credit facilities  offset in part by the purchase of million of the company s stock in market transactions  which is held as treasury stock 
this compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in representing primarily net borrowings under the company s credit facilities  offset in part by the purchase of million in treasury stock 
the company s board of directors previously approved plans to repurchase up to a total of  shares of the company s common stock 
as of march   the company had repurchased  shares at an average cost of per share 
the company has funded the repurchases primarily through available bank credit facilities 
the timing  price  quantity and manner of future purchases will be made at the discretion of management and will depend upon market conditions 
the company intends to fund the repurchase program through available credit under its bank credit facilities and current cash flows from operations 
the special charges recorded in and included accruals totaling approximately million to record the estimated monthly lease payments  net of expected sublease receipts  associated with certain restaurants which have been closed 
cash requirements for this accrual were approximately million during year ended january  during the year ended january   the company sold properties relating to the special charges which resulted in proceeds of million 
subsequent to january  the company sold one property relating to the special charges which resulted in proceeds of  which approximated the carrying value of the property 
the company currently has two closed restaurant property for sale which were covered by the special charges 
although there can be no assurance of the particular price at which such property will be sold  the company expects to receive funds equal to or in excess of the carrying value upon the actual disposition of this property 
in addition  certain acquisition and accrued liabilities related to the two pesos acquisition were reduced by payments of approximately  during the year ended january  the company believes that existing cash balances  funds generated from operations  its ability to borrow  and the possible use of lease financing will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through  including the planned opening of ten to twelve restaurants and the reimaging of to restaurants 
total capital expenditures related to new restaurants are estimated to be to million 
the total for other capital expenditures  including the cost of the reimagings  is estimated to be to million 
total capital expenditures for are expected to approximate to million 
impact of inflation although increases in labor  food or other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations  management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on the company s operations to date 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s sales fluctuate seasonally 
historically  the company s highest sales and earnings occur in the second and third quarters 
in addition  quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores  and the company s growth may offset the impact of seasonal influences 
therefore  quarterly results are not indicative of results for the entire year 
year issue description 
the company relies to a large extent on computer technology to carry out its day to day operations 
many software products in the marketplace are only able to recognize a two digit year date and therefore will recognize a date using as the year instead of the year the year issue 
this problem could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
state of readiness 
the company has established a plan to prepare its systems for the year issue as well as to reasonably assure that its critical business partners are prepared 
to date  the company has completed its assessment of all internal systems that could be significantly affected by the year issue 
based upon its assessment  the company determined that it was required to modify or replace portions of its software supporting human resources  payroll  accounting  labor analysis and the point of sale 
the company believes that with modifications or replacements of the identified software programs  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if all additional phases of the year plan are not completed on time  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
as of march   the company has substantially completed the remediation of the identified systems and expects to complete software reprogramming and replacement no later than june  once the software is reprogrammed or replaced with a year compliant version  the company will test and implement the software completion of the testing phase for all significant systems is expected by june  many hardware upgrades were necessary but no further hardware replacement has been identified as a result of the year issue 
as such  the company is not currently remediating additional hardware 
however  the existence of embedded technology is by nature more difficult to identify 
while the company believes that all significant systems are year compliant  the company plans to continue testing its operating equipment 
the company has deferred other information technology projects due to the year issue 
the deferral of these projects is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
significant third parties 
the company s significant third party business partners consist of suppliers  banks  and service providers 
the company has significant system interfaces with banks  credit card processors and tax filing services 
an initial inventory of significant third party business partners has been completed and letters mailed requesting information regarding each parties year compliance status 
additionally  the company has identified key suppliers and distributors which it intends to meet with and discuss their year readiness 
the company intends to develop contingency plans by june  for third party business partners that appear to have substantial year operational risks  which may include the change of some suppliers to minimize such risks 
costs 
the company will use both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test software for year issue modifications 
the total cost of the year issue project is estimated to be approximately  of which the company has incurred  relating to the purchase of new software 
the costs relating to the year issue are being financed through operating cash flows and borrowings from the company s available credit facilities 
of the total project cost  the majority is attributable to the purchase of new software  which will be capitalized 
the remaining amount  which will be expensed as incurred over the next year  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
to date  the costs the company has incurred and expensed relating to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts in connection with  its year issue and the development of a remediation plan have not had a material effect on the results of operations 
risks and contingency plans 
management believes it has an effective plan in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
however  due to the forward looking nature and lack of historical experience with year issues  it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen after december  despite the year remediation efforts being made  it is likely that there will be disruptions and unexpected business problems during the early months of the company plans to make diligent efforts to assess the year readiness of its significant business partners and will develop contingency plans for all critical systems where it believes its exposure to year risk is the greatest 
however  despite the company s efforts  it may encounter unanticipated third party failures  public infrastructure failures or a failure to successfully conclude its remediation efforts as planned 
if the remaining year plan is not completed timely  in addition to the implications noted above  the company may be required to utilize manual processing of certain otherwise automated processes 
any one of these unforeseen events could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows in and beyond

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of its notes payable and outstanding line of credit 
the company has notes payable and a line of credit which bear interest at the lesser of the london interbank offer rate plus or the prime rate 
the aggregate balance outstanding of these notes and the line of credit as of march  was million 
the company also has a note payable which bears interest at the prime rate 
the outstanding balance of this note as of march  was million 
the impact on the company s results of operations of a one point interest rate change on the outstanding balances under the notes payable and line of credit as of march  would be immaterial

these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature
