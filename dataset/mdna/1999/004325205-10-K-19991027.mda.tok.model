item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview acclaim develops  publishes  distributes and markets video and computer games for use with game consoles  both dedicated and portable  and pcs on a worldwide basis 
the company owns and operates five software development studios located in the us and the us where it develops its own software  and a motion capture studio in the us from time to time  acclaim hires independent developers to create software for it 
acclaim publishes  or releases to the public under its brand names  software developed by it as well as third party developers 
acclaim distributes its software directly in north america  the u 
k  germany  france  spain and australia 
acclaim also distributes software developed and published by third parties and develops strategy guides relating to the company s software and comic book magazines 
the company s operating strategy is to develop and maintain a core of key brands of software titles  such as turok  shadow man  south park  nfl quarterback club and all star baseball 
acclaim focuses on developing and publishing software for the game consoles that are popular at a given time or which it believes will become popular 
the company s console titles are primarily sports simulation and arcade style performance games  and its pc titles are primarily arcade style performance games  real time simulation  adventure and sports simulation games 
the interactive entertainment software industry is driven by the size of the installed base of game consoles  such as those manufactured by nintendo  sony and sega  and pcs dedicated for home use 
the interactive entertainment software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes mostly due to o the introduction of game consoles incorporating more powerful processors and operating systems  o the impact of technological changes embodied in pcs  o the development of electronic and wireless delivery systems  and o the entry and participation of new companies in the industry 
these and other factors have resulted in successive introductions of increasingly advanced game consoles and pcs 
as a result of the rapid technological shifts  no single game console or pc system has achieved long term dominance in the video and computer games market 
therefore  acclaim must continually anticipate game console cycles and its research and development group must develop programming tools and engines necessary for the development of software for emerging hardware systems 
the rapid technological advances in game consoles have significantly changed the look and feel of software as well as the software development process 
currently  the process of developing software is extremely complex and acclaim expects it to become more complex and expensive in the future as more powerful and complex hardware is introduced 
according to acclaim estimates  the average development time for a title is between and months and the average development cost for a title is between and million 
approximately  and of the company s gross revenues in the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively  were derived from software developed by its studios 
see factors affecting future performance increased product development costs may adversely affect profitability 
the company s performance has historically been materially affected by platform transitions and product cycles 
as a result of the industry transition to and bit game consoles which commenced in  the company s software sales during fiscal  and were significantly lower than in fiscal and the company s inability to predict accurately the timing of such transition resulted in material losses in fiscal and the company believes its results in those years were also adversely impacted by the fact that the company had not yet received a significant portion of the benefits of implementing its brand strategy and its internal development strategy through its owned studios and that the studios had not yet developed the game engines which are capable of being used in multiple titles to support the strategy 
see factors affecting future performance industry trends  platform transitions and technological change may adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
in the past  the company has experienced delays in the introduction of new titles  which has had a negative impact on its results of operations 
it is likely that some of the company s titles will not be released in accordance with the company s operating plans for a period  in which event its results of operations and profitability in that period could be negatively affected 
see factors affecting future performance revenues are dependent on timely introduction of new titles 
the company recorded a net loss of million and net earnings of million and million in fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
the fiscal results primarily reflect increased sales in the united states of the company s software for the current generation of hardware systems  n and playstation 
the company believes that the market for n and playstation is reaching maturity 
no assurance can be given as to the future growth of the software market for n and playstation systems  the timely introduction and market acceptance of the company s software therefor or of the company s results of operations and profitability in future periods 
the results for fiscal years ended august  and also reflect the company s significantly reduced operating expenses as compared to prior periods 
the company s ability to generate sales growth and profitability in the short term will be materially dependent on the continued growth of the software market for and bit and other new emerging game consoles and the company s ability to identify  develop and publish hit software for those platforms 
results of operations the following table shows certain statements of consolidated operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended august  domestic revenues foreign revenues net revenues cost of revenues gross profit marketing and sales general and administrative research and development goodwill writedown litigation settlements recoveries downsizing charge total operating expenses earnings loss from operations other expense income  net earnings loss before income taxes net earnings loss net revenues the company s gross revenues were derived from the following product categories portable software bit software bit software bit software computer games software other the numbers in this chart do not give effect to sales credits and allowances granted by the company since the company does not track such credits and allowances by product category 
accordingly  the numbers presented may vary materially from those that would be disclosed if the company were able to present such information as a percentage of net revenues 
the increase in the company s net revenues from million for the year ended august  to million for the year ended august  was predominantly due to increased revenues from sales of the company s bit software 
the increase in sales in fiscal was primarily due to the continued increase in the installed base of n and playstation consoles worldwide and the quality and market acceptance of the company s titles for those platforms 
the company anticipates that titles currently scheduled for introduction in the first quarter of fiscal will be shipped as announced  however  no assurance can be given that these titles will be released in accordance with such announcements 
assuming timely shipment of the company s titles  the company s revenues from the sale of software are anticipated to grow in fiscal  however  the company anticipates that  for fiscal as a whole  its growth rate will be lower than its fiscal and growth rates of and  respectively 
if the company does not release new titles as planned in fiscal  the company s net revenues would be materially negatively impacted and the company could incur losses from operations 
the company anticipates that its mix of domestic and foreign net revenues will continue to be affected by the content of titles released by the company to the extent such titles are geared towards the domestic market 
the increase in the company s net revenues from million for the year ended august  to million for the year ended august  was predominantly due to increased sales in the united states of the company s bit and  to a lesser extent  bit software 
the increase in sales in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in the installed base of n and playstation consoles worldwide and the quality of the company s titles 
the company s domestic sales in fiscal comprised a higher percentage of total net revenues compared to fiscal primarily because the titles published by the company in achieved greater popularity in the domestic market for example  wwf war zone and nfl quarterback club 
a significant portion of the company s revenues in any quarter are generally derived from software first released in that quarter or in the immediately preceding quarter 
see factors affecting future performance revenues are dependent on timely introduction of new titles and the company s future success is dependent on its ability to release hit titles

for the years ended august   and  the company derived  and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of nintendo compatible software   and of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of software for playstation and  less than and less than of its gross revenues  respectively  from sales of sega compatible software 
the company has a license to develop  and release  titles for sega s dreamcast platform introduced in the united states in september  has released one title for dreamcast in the fourth quarter of fiscal and plans to release additional titles for that platform in fiscal see factors affecting future performance if the company is unable to obtain or renew licenses from hardware developers  it will not be able to release software for game consoles 
gross profit gross profit is primarily impacted by the percentage of sales of cd software as compared to the percentage of sales of cartridge software 
gross profit may also be impacted from time to time by the percentage of foreign sales  the percentage of foreign sales to third party distributors  and the level of returns and price protection and concessions to retailers and distributors 
the company s margins on sales of cd software currently  playstation  pcs and dreamcast are higher than those on cartridge software currently  n and game boy color as a result of significantly lower cd software product costs 
the company s margins on foreign software sales to third party distributors are approximately one third lower than those on sales that the company makes directly to foreign retailers

general and administrative expenses were million of net revenues for the year ended august   million of net revenues for the year ended august  and increased to million of net revenues for the year ended august  the dollar decrease in fiscal was primarily due to cost reduction efforts initiated by the company in fiscal  and the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to a higher level of expenses in all categories 
research and development expenses were million of net revenues for the year ended august   million of net revenues for the year ended august  and increased to million of net revenues for the year ended august  the dollar decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the consolidation of certain of the company s studio operations  reduced personnel costs and other cost reduction efforts initiated by the company

the provision for income taxes of million primarily relates to federal alternative minimum  state and foreign taxes 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal  with higher revenues and operating income typically occurring during its first  second and fourth fiscal quarters which correspond to the holiday selling season 
however  the timing of the delivery of software titles and the releases of new products cause material fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenues and earnings  which may cause the company s results to vary from the seasonal patterns of the industry as a whole

the increase in net cash derived from financing activities in the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period is primarily attributable to the increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants

the company s software for n  playstation  dreamcast and pcs is year compliant 
the company is continuing to seek information regarding year compliance from vendors  customers  manufacturers  outside developers  and financial institutions associated with the company 
however  given the reliance on third party information as it relates to their compliance programs and the difficulty of determining potential errors on the part of external service suppliers  no assurance can be given that the company s information systems or operations will not be affected by mistakes  if any  of third parties or third party failures to complete the year project on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems 
the cost of the company s year project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the necessary testing are based on the company s estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its internal information systems and products

the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of its subsidiaries functional currency as compared to the currencies of its foreign denominated sales and purchases 
the results of operations of the company s subsidiaries  as reported in us dollars  may be significantly affected by fluctuations in the value of the local currencies in which the company transacts business 
such amount is recorded upon the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars  and is dependent upon the various foreign exchange rates and the magnitude of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements 
at august   the company s foreign currency translation adjustment is not material and  for the year ended august   net foreign currency transaction losses were insignificant 
see note k of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and related expenses  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company is not exposed to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term obligations since the majority of the company s long term obligations are at fixed rates
