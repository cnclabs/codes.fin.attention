in addition to dealing with the company s yk code  the yk program also is designed to identify and evaluate the year readiness of the company s key suppliers of inventory and non inventory goods and services  and of the company s significant customers 
the yk program  as it relates to the company s computer programs and embedded technology  has five phases assessing computer programs and embedded technology to identify yk code  assigning priorities to the identified yk code  repairing or replacing yk code to make such yk code year capable  testing the repaired or replaced yk code  and developing and implementing  as necessary  contingency plans to address the possibility that the company or third parties  whose operations or business could affect the company  do not become year capable 
the company has engaged certain outside consultants with recognized expertise in assessing and dealing with year needs  principally computer sciences corporation  to assist in the management of the yk program and in the repair and testing of certain yk code 
the yk program focuses on company yk code in three principal areas infrastructure  applications software  and facility operations  where the great majority of embedded technology is found 
the infrastructure area involves hardware and systems software other than applications software 
as hardware and systems software is repaired  upgraded or replaced  they are tested to ensure that they are year capable 
the company expects the infrastructure portion of the yk program to be completed by june  significant portions of the company s application software will be replaced by new software  principally sap  an erp software package 
at december   the global design for the sap project was complete  and the first implementation  encompassing the company s north american operations  is scheduled to take place in may  the scheduled date under the sap project plans 
applications software yk code not being replaced as part of the sap project is being repaired  upgraded or replaced where an upgrade or replacement is available from the supplier of such software to make such yk code year capable

the remaining amount  totaling million  represents the costs of repair  testing and related efforts  and is being expensed as incurred 
of the million spent as at december   approximately million related to capital and the balance of million was expensed

the failure to make yk code year capable could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain business activities or operations  which could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
the company currently expects that the company s yk code will be year capable on or before december  due to general uncertainty about the overall extent of the year problem  however  including  but not limited to  uncertainty about the extent of year capability of the company s suppliers and customers  the company is currently unable to determine whether the consequences of the failure of entities other than the company to be year capable will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
subject to the above uncertainties  however  the company believes that  with the completion of the yk program as scheduled  and with the implementation of sap  the likelihood of material interruptions of the company s normal business should be reduced 
notwithstanding the company s belief  the company is currently unable to predict  and thus to describe  its most likely worst case year scenario 
to address the possibility that the company or its suppliers  customers  or other third parties are not successful in becoming year capable  the company has commenced to develop contingency plans for the critical aspects of its operations 
such plans will be designed to avoid or mitigate potential serious disruptions in the company s business and will be refined and modified as the company monitors and evaluates the progress of its yk program
