the company acquired million in treasury stock and paid million in dividends 
this activity was funded from the net income generated in of million  depreciation and amortization totaling million  proceeds from the sale of the fuller s earth business amounting to million and additional borrowings of million 
the company currently anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million for the current indicated annual dividend rate is

in both and  unit sales volume increased at a faster rate than the sales dollars 
gross profit margins improved slightly from to  and increased from to margins improved in primarily as a result of lower costs for acrylic acid  while the over improvement was primarily a result of higher capacity utilization 
in each case  the lower costs more than offset lower unit selling prices 
the gross profit margin also reflected the additional costs of shipping products from the united states to the united kingdom to meet customer demand in excess of the uk plant capacity in the first half of while general  selling and administrative expenses have increased from to and from to  the rate of increase is less than the rate of increase in sales 
in  the increase related primarily to a higher bad debt provision 
much of the increased cost was directed to research and development of new products unrelated to the current markets served 
the company has aggressively expanded its capacity to produce superabsorbent polymers

domestic metalcasting sales increased in  offsetting sales declines to the domestic well drilling and export markets 
sales increased in virtually all sectors of the minerals segment  except for iron ore pelletizing  from to metalcasting and cat litter sales led the increase 
as a result of the cat litter acquisition made in late  the uk mineral operation produced an operating loss of approximately million 
the company experienced management problems  customer service problems  production problems and construction delays in integrating the acquisition into the existing plant and organization 
the problems have been identified and corrective action is under way 
it is management s current estimate that the uk mineral operation will not reach an operating profit break even until the fourth quarter of gross profit margins increased by and by from to and from to  respectively 
the domestic gross profit margin improvement from to of was largely offset by the problems at the uk operation

impact of new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas is effective for fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company has not yet completed its evaluation of this statement  but does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this accounting standard 
year issues in mid  the company started a year date conversion project to address all necessary code changes  testing and implementation for all of its computer systems 
concurrently  the company sent inquiries to its suppliers and other key third parties to assess their ability to become year compliant in a timely manner 
the internal evaluation stage is completed except for a number of personal computers  and the company is still awaiting responses from some third parties 
the implementation phase is in progress 
many of the company s computer systems rely on purchased software for which the company pays a maintenance fee 
the maintenance fee covers the cost of system upgrades  including the update for year issues 
the company s financial reporting system is expected to be year compliant by the end of the first quarter of through the use of software upgrades performed as part of the periodic upgrade process 
the company is relying on its vendor to bring the company s network system and servers into year compliance by april  evaluation of the company s personal computer equipment should be completed by april   with remediation to be completed by june  the company also replaced its headquarters telecommunications system as a result of office infrastructure changes 
the new system is year compliant 
with respect to the company s non information technology systems  the company is still in the process of evaluating the presence of imbedded date chips in some of its plant machinery and equipment  and expects that its review will be completed by april  any remediation will be completed by june costs and expenses incurred to date in addressing the year issue have not been material  and based upon the company s assessment and remediation efforts to date  future costs of conversion or upgrades are not expected to be material 
the company does not believe that there is a material risk to its business or financial condition related to its own systems from year issues  but the company has no control over the ability of its key suppliers and other key third parties to achieve year compliance in a timely manner 
for example  an interruption in the supply of power to its plants and the inability to ship the company s products by rail are both issues that could have severe adverse consequences to the company s ability to carry on its business at current profit levels 
should rail service become temporarily unavailable  the company would likely ship product by truck  but at a higher cost 
a prolonged interruption in the power supply to its major plants  in particular its absorbent polymer plants in aberdeen  mississippi  and in the united kingdom  however  is a risk that is difficult to minimize 
while the company continues to focus on solutions for the year issues  and expects to be year compliant in a timely manner  a contingency plan is being developed 
such plan is intended to address the company s response should it  or materially significant third parties  fail to achieve year compliance in a timely manner 
the contingency plan is expected to be finalized by september  the company s expectations about future costs necessary to achieve year compliance  the impact on its operations and its ability to bring each of its systems into year compliance are forward looking statements subject to a number of uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially 
such factors include the following i the company has no control over the ability of its key suppliers and other third parties to achieve year compliance  ii the nature and number of systems that require remediation may exceed the company s expectations in terms of complexity and scope  iii the company may not be able to complete all remediation and testing necessary in a timely manner  and iv the company may not be successful in properly identifying all systems and programs that contain two digit year codes 
the company s systems disaster recovery planning is a comprehensive  ongoing process  which is updated as products are developed  tested and modified 
disaster recovery for financial and other strategic systems is provided at alternative locations serviced by third parties  or at company maintained facilities 
conversion to euro on january   european union member states adopted the euro as their common national currency 
from that date until january  the transition period either the euro or a participating country s currency will be accepted as legal tender 
beginning on january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and by july   only euro currency will be used 
management continues to address the strategic  financial  legal and systems issues related to the various phases of transition 
while the company does not believe the ultimate costs of conversion will be material to its earnings  cash flow or financial position  every effort is being made to address customer and business needs on a timely basis and anticipate and prevent any complications during the transition period 
forward looking statements certain statements made from time to time by the company  including statements in the management s discussion and analysis section above  constitute forward looking statements made in reliance upon the safe harbor contained in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements include statements relating to the company or its operations that are preceded by terms such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends and similar expressions  and statements relating to anticipated growth  levels of capital expenditures  future dividends  expansion into global markets and the development of new products 
such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from the results  performance or achievements expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including without limitation  the following growth rate of absorbent polymer operations a significant part of our growth in sales and profit during the last five years has come from sales of superabsorbent polymers sap 
our sales of sap have increased in part because newer diaper designs use larger amounts of sap and because of growth in our sales to international markets 
our ability to continue this growth depends on several factors  including the following our ability to retain key clients  the continued use of larger amounts of sap in new diaper designs  the continued growth in sales to international markets  growth in sales to manufacturers of brand name products  and acceptance of new applications for sap which we have developed 
there can be no assurance that our sales of sap will continue to grow in the future or remain at current levels 
dependence on large absorbent polymer customers our two largest absorbent polymer customers accounted for approximately of our absorbent polymer sales in and our four largest absorbent polymer customers accounted for approximately of such sales 
we do not usually enter into long term contracts with our absorbent polymer customers 
these customers generally have the right to terminate their relationship with us with little or no notice 
we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current level of sales to our four largest absorbent polymer customers or any other customer in the future 
many diaper manufacturers  including some of our customers  frequently change their diaper designs 
during this process  many diaper manufacturers review the types of sap available to determine the type of sap best suited for their new diaper design 
some of our customers may elect to use the sap of one of our competitors in their new diaper designs 
the termination of our relationship with any of our significant absorbent polymer customers or a material reduction in the sap sold to such customers could adversely affect our business and future financial results 
competition absorbent polymers 
the absorbent polymers market is very competitive 
our united states operations compete with approximately four manufacturers and at least three importers 
our united kingdom operations compete with numerous manufacturers 
two of our competitors have more production capability and several producers have greater resources 
in addition  several of our competitors also produce acrylic acid  which is the primary cost component of sap 
the cost of acrylic acid to these competitors may be significantly less than the price we pay for acrylic acid 
we believe competition in our absorbent polymers segment is primarily a matter of product quality and price 
if we fail to compete successfully based on these or other factors  we may lose customers or fail to attract new customers and our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
minerals 
the minerals market is very competitive 
we believe competition is essentially a matter of product quality  price  delivery  service and technical support 
several of our competitors in the united states market are larger and have substantially greater financial resources 
if we fail to compete successfully based on these or other factors  we may lose customers or fail to recruit new customers and our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
technology we believe our success and ability to compete in the absorbent polymers segment depends  to a large extent  on our proprietary production process 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  trademark  and other intellectual property laws to protect this proprietary technology 
however  we may have difficulty monitoring the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and the steps we have taken to protect it may not be adequate 
any misappropriation of our proprietary technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or future financial results 
in addition  if any of our competitors become able to produce a more effective or cheaper sap  demand for our sap products may decrease or be eliminated 
reliance on metalcasting and construction industries approximately of our minerals segment s sales and of our environmental segment s sales in were to the metalcasting and construction markets  respectively 
the metalcasting and construction markets depend heavily upon the strength of the domestic and international economies 
if these economies weaken  demand for products from our minerals segment by the metalcasting market and from our environmental segment for the construction markets may decline and our business or future financial results may be adversely affected 
regulatory and legal matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety matters 
substantial penalties may be imposed if we violate certain of these laws and regulations 
if these laws or regulations are changed or interpreted differently in the future  it may become difficult or expensive for us to comply 
in addition  investigations or evaluations of our products by government agencies may require us to adopt additional safety measures or precautions 
if our costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future materially increase  our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
the company may be subject to adverse litigation results  as well as  future changes in laws and regulations which may negatively impact its operations and profits 
availability of raw materials acrylic acid is our primary cost component in manufacturing sap 
acrylic acid is only available from a limited number of suppliers 
if we become unable to obtain a sufficient supply of sap at a reasonable price  our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
risks of international expansion an important part of our business strategy is to expand internationally 
we intend to seek acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic alliances globally 
currently  our business outside of the united states represents approximately of our consolidated sales 
the approximate breakdown of the sales outside of the united states for was as follows europe  latin america including mexico  asia  africa and the middle east  and other 
as we expand internationally  we will be subject to increased risks  which may include the following currency exchange or price control laws  currency translation adjustments  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
the above listed events could result in sudden  and potentially prolonged  changes in demand for the company s products 
also  we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting accounts receivable through a foreign country s legal system 
at december   approximately of the gross accounts receivable were due from customers outside of the united states and canada 
the breakdown of the overseas balance was as follows europe  latin america including mexico  asia  and africa and the middle east 
volatility of stock price the stock market has been extremely volatile in recent years 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock fluctuations in our financial results  our introduction of new services or products  announcements of acquisitions  strategic alliances or joint ventures by us  our customers or our competitors  changes in analysts recommendations regarding our common stock  and general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will increase in the future or be maintained at its recent levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational corporation that manufactures and markets products in countries throughout the world  the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency  interest rates and government actions 
the company uses a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including  when considered appropriate  derivative financial instruments 
the company uses derivative financial instruments only for risk management and does not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate sensitivity the company is exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the german mark  the british pound  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the mexican peso  the thai baht and the korean won 
the company s various currency exposures often offset each other  providing a natural hedge against currency risk 
periodically  specific foreign currency transactions eg inventory purchases  royalty payments  etc 
are hedged with forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency risk 
gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges are included in the basis of the underlying hedged transactions 
as of december   the company had outstanding foreign currency contracts to sell the equivalent of million of british pounds to hedge raw material purchases 
the fair value of these agreements results in an immaterial unrecognized loss at december  interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt obligations 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the company s reporting currency 
the instrument s actual cash flows are primarily denominated in both us dollars us  german marks dm  british pounds bp  norwegian kroner nok  singapore dollar sdg  korean won won and thai baht thb as indicated in parentheses 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value us equivalent in millions long term debt fixed rate us       average interest rate variable rate us    average interest rate variable rate bp    average interest rate variable rate dm    average interest rate variable rate nok   average interest rate variable rate sdg average interest rate variable rate won average interest rate variable rate thb    average interest rate debt to be refinanced    total         the company periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on debt securities 
these instruments allow the company to exchange variable rate debt into fixed rate or fixed rate debt into variable rate 
interest rate differentials paid or received on these arrangements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense over the life of the agreements 
at december   the company had one interest rate swap outstanding  which expires in september  in a notional amount of million 
the fair value of this agreement results in an unrecognized loss at december   of the company is exposed to credit risk on certain assets  primarily cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
the credit risk associated with cash equivalents and short term investments is mitigated by the company s policy of investing in securities with high credit ratings and investing through major financial institutions with high credit ratings 
the company provides credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base 
the company currently believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks 
the company s accounts receivable financial instruments  other than those discussed above  are carried at amounts that approximate fair value 
commodity price sensitivity acrylic acid is the most significant cost component in the production of sap 
the company purchases a significant amount of acrylic acid under long term contracts 
the terms of these contracts include a linkage to the cost of propylene 
the company has not hedged against fluctuations in the cost of propylene
