the systems that might be affected by the year issue are the company s internal corporate support systems  including a mid range computer system the company relies upon to assimilate accounting information and produce internal and external accounting reports  the company s internal personal computer network and related software that it relies upon to produce correspondence and daily and weekly financial data  the com pany s point of sale and restaurant back office accounting systems that it relies upon to process guest orders  track the status of orders  schedule and track time and attendance information and related labor costs  and produce store level operating data  restaurant equipment necessary to prepare the guests orders  and third party systems such as computer systems used by the banking  telephone  utility  food preparation and distribution industries  all of which are necessary to the basic operation of the company s restaurants 
in  the company began identifying those most critical areas that might be deficient and established a time line to complete the necessary analysis and remediation plans 
the company has begun correcting the deficiencies identified in all affected areas and anticipates completion of the remediation plans by september  the established cost of the analysis and remediation plans related to the year issues is approximately as part of this process  the company has assessed the role of critical suppliers of products and services to determine the extent that the company might be vulnerable in the event that these suppliers have failures due to the year issue 
a questionnaire has been provided to  and research is being conducted on  critical suppliers to determine their state of year readiness 
when critical suppliers or processes might not be compliant  or compliance is uncertain  the company is establishing contingency plans in the event that such suppliers or processes fail to perform after december  such contingency plans might consist of converting to manual systems or changing to alternative processes or suppliers that will function properly after december  the company anticipates that it will complete these contingency plans by september  as of the filing date of this report  the company is unable to reasonably estimate the effect  if any  on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows from the failure of its significant vendors to be year ready 
the company has determined that the worst case scenario related to the year issue would be a complete failure of the company s systems and those of the company s critical suppliers of products and services 
the failure of the company s information systems  embedded systems  or business processes or the systems of third parties to timely achieve year compliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results
