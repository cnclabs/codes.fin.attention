as of december   the minimum guaranteed payments required to be made by the company under such agreements were  the company s minimum guaranteed payments are subject to reduction in the case of certain agreements based upon the appreciation of warrants issued  the value of stock received on exercise of such warrants and the amount of profit sharing earned under the related agreements

the company believes that its current cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  the company expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for at least the next to months 
to the extent the company requires additional funds to support its operations or the expansion of its business  the company may sell additional equity  issue debt or convertible securities or obtain credit facilities through financial institutions 
the sale of additional equity or convertible securities will result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available to the company in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company 
year compliance the company utilizes a significant number of computer software programs and operating systems across its entire organization  including applications used in operating the company s various web sites  member services  e commerce  and various administrative and billing functions 
to the extent that the company s software applications contain source codes that are unable to appropriately interpret the upcoming calendar year  some level of modification  or even possible replacement of such applications may be necessary 
the company has retained a consulting firm to help assess the company s year compliance 
the assessment is currently being conducted in three phases  the first two of which have been completed 
during phase one the company analyzed facilities  applications  network  distributed computing  infrastructure  and data in order to determine the size  scope  and complexity of the company s exposure to year during phase two specific strategies required to bring exposure areas into compliance were formulated 
additionally  during phase two  the company began interviewing hardware  software  market feed  and firmware vendors for year compliance plans 
the results of the first and second phases were used to develop a compliance renovation approach  budget  and project plan which includes an analysis of compliance strategies  cost parameters and timelines 
during phase three  the company will complete the renovations of software and applications  implement hardware patches  develop project contingencies and complete final testing 
the company expects to be substantially year compliant before the end of april with respect to its mission critical computing infrastructure  associated applications  and strategic vendors suppliers 
the costs incurred by the company during to address the year compliance were approximately  the company estimates it will incur a maximum of  in direct costs during to support its compliance initiatives 
although the company expects to be year compliant on or before december   there can be no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal systems or by failures of its vendors partners to address their year issues in a timely and effective manner 
should miscalculations or other operational errors occur as a result of the year issue  the company or the parties on which it depends may be unable to produce reliable information or to process routine transactions 
furthermore  in the worst case  the company or the parties on which it depends may  for an extended period of time  be incapable of conducting critical business activities which include  but are not limited to  the production and delivery of the company s internet sites  invoicing customers and paying vendors  which could have material adverse effect on the company s business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
seasonality the company expects that its revenue will be higher leading up to and during major us sports seasons and lower at other times of the year  particularly during the summer months 
in addition  the effect of such seasonal fluctuations in revenue could be enhanced or offset by revenue associated with major sports events  such as the olympics  the ryder cup and the world cup  although such events do not occur every year 
the company believes that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year  and that advertising expenditures fluctuate significantly with economic cycles 
depending on the extent to which the internet is accepted as an advertising medium  seasonality and cyclicality in the level of internet advertising expenditures could become more pronounced 
the foregoing factors could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

and presently does not have any derivative instruments 
risk factors that may affect future results the company s business  results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the following risk factors related to the company s operations limited operating history  anticipation of continuing losses  accumulated deficit the company was incorporated in february and commercially introduced its first web site in august the company first recognized revenue from operations in the quarter ended september  accordingly  the company has a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of the company and its prospects can be based 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in the new and rapidly evolving internet based advertising  information services and commerce markets 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  provide compelling and original content to internet users  maintain existing relationships and effectively develop new relationships with advertisers  their advertising agencies and other third parties  develop and upgrade its technology  respond to competitive developments and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in addressing such risks  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
since its inception  the company has incurred substantial costs to develop and enhance its technology  to create  introduce and enhance its service offerings  to acquire and develop content  to build traffic on its web sites  to acquire members  to establish marketing relationships and to build an administrative organization 
the company intends to continue these efforts and  in addition  to increase its spending for content development and acquisition and for marketing 
the company has entered into various licensing  royalty and consulting agreements with content providers  vendors  athletes and sports organizations  which agreements provide for consideration in various forms  including issuance of warrants to purchase common stock and payment of royalties  bounties and certain other guaranteed amounts on a per member and or a minimum dollar amount basis over terms ranging from one to ten years 
additionally  some of these agreements provide for a specified percentage of advertising and merchandising revenue to be paid to the athlete or organization from whose web site the revenue is derived 
as of december   the minimum guaranteed payments required to be made by the company under such agreements were  the company s minimum guaranteed payments are subject to reduction in the case of certain agreements based upon the appreciation of warrants issued  the value of stock received on exercise of such warrants and the amount of profit sharing earned under the related agreements 
also  the company recorded non cash expense of  for the year ended december  related to the cbs agreement and will record an additional  of non cash expense related to the cbs agreement over the remaining eight year term of that agreement 
additionally  non cash expense under the company s agreement with aol will total  over the remaining term of such agreement 
as a consequence of the foregoing  the company has incurred operating losses in each of its fiscal quarters and years since inception and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for at least the next to months 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  the company has achieved only limited revenue to date and its ability to generate significant revenue is subject to substantial uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that the company will ever generate sufficient revenue to meet its expenses or achieve or maintain profitability and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  in view of the rapidly evolving nature of the company s business and its limited operating history  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
unpredictability of future revenue  potential fluctuations in quarterly operating results  seasonality as a result of the company s relatively short operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which it competes  the company is limited in its ability to accurately forecast its revenue 
the company derives revenue from a mix of advertising  merchandise sales  membership and premium service fees  content licensing  web site development and syndication fees 
because changes in revenue from memberships and premium services are expected to occur over a period of time while advertising revenue will be recognized when the advertisements appear  fluctuations in quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to be particularly affected by the level of advertising revenue within each quarter 
the company s current and future expense levels are based largely on its expectations concerning future revenue and are to a large extent fixed 
accordingly  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  and a shortfall in revenue in relation to the company s expectations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company currently intends to significantly increase its operating expenses to develop and enhance its technology  to create  introduce and enhance its service offerings  to acquire and develop content  to fund increased sales and marketing expenses and to enter into new strategic agreements 
to the extent that such expenses precede or are not subsequently followed by increased revenue  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control 
these factors include the level of usage of the internet  the level of traffic on the company s web sites  demand for internet advertising  seasonal trends in both internet usage and advertising placements  the addition or loss of advertisers  the advertising budgeting cycles of individual advertisers  the number of users that purchase memberships  merchandise or premium services  the amount and timing of capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of the company s operations  the introduction of new sites and services by the company or its competitors  price competition or pricing changes in the industry  general economic conditions  and economic conditions specific to the internet  electronic commerce and online media 
the company expects that its revenue will be higher leading up to and during major us sports seasons and lower at other times of the year  particularly during the summer months 
in addition  the effect of such seasonal fluctuations in revenue could be enhanced or offset by revenue associated with major sports events  such as the olympics  the ryder cup and the world cup  although such events do not occur every year 
the company believes that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year  and that advertising expenditures fluctuate significantly with economic cycles 
depending on the extent to which the internet is accepted as an advertising medium  seasonality and cyclicality in the level of internet advertising expenditures could become more pronounced 
the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that the company s operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter 
in such event  the trading price of the common stock would likely be materially adversely affected

com  cnn and sports illustrated s cnn si and fox sports or to enthusiasts of particular sports such as web sites maintained by major league baseball  the nfl  the nba and the nhl  ii publishers and distributors of traditional off line media such as television  radio and print  including those targeted to sports enthusiasts  many of which have established or may establish web sites  iii general purpose consumer online services such as aol and microsoft network  each of which provides access to sports related content and services  iv vendors of sports information  merchandise  products and services distributed through other means  including retail stores  mail  facsimile and private bulletin board services  and v web search and retrieval services  such as altavista  excite  infoseek  lycos and yahoo  and other high traffic web sites  such as those operated by cynet and netscape 
the company anticipates that the number of its direct and indirect competitors will increase in the future 
management believes that the company s most significant competitors are espn 
com  cnn si and fox sports  web sites that offer a variety of sports content 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  significantly greater name recognition and substantially larger user or membership bases than the company and  therefore  have a significantly greater ability to attract advertisers and users 
in addition  many of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly than the company to new or emerging technologies and changes in internet user requirements and to devote greater resources than the company to the development  promotion and sale of their services 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those developed by the company or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing internet user preferences 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which would materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  as the company expands internationally it may face new competition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by the company would not have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on content providers  significant payments required to be made to content providers  risk of third party claims the company relies on independent content providers for sports news  scores  statistics and other sports information 
the company s future success depends  in significant part  on its ability to maintain and renew its existing relationships with such content providers and to build new relationships with other content providers 
the company s agreements with content providers generally are short term and may be terminated by the content provider if the company fails to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreement 
some of the company s content providers compete with one another and  to some extent  with the company for advertising and members 
termination of one or more significant content provider agreements would decrease the availability of sports news and information which the company can offer its customers and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s agreements with most of its content providers are nonexclusive  and many of the company s competitors offer  or could offer  content that is similar or the same as that obtained by the company from such content providers 
in addition  the growing reach and use of the internet have further intensified competition in this industry 
consumers have gained free access to certain information provided directly on the internet by certain content providers 
to the extent that content providers  including but not limited to the company s current suppliers  provide information to users at a lower cost than the company or at minimal or no cost  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
fees payable to content providers constitute a significant portion of the company s cost of revenue 
there can be no assurance that the company s content providers will enter into or renew agreements with the company on the same or similar terms as those currently in effect 
if the company is required to increase the fees payable to its content providers  such increased payments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the company may in the future be subject to third party claims  for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of information supplied by its content providers  and any such claims may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see intellectual property  risk of third party claims for infringement and liability for information retrieved from the internet 
risks associated with potential acquisitions and investments the company pursues opportunities to acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies that would complement or expand its existing business 
a decision by the company to pursue a significant business expansion  acquisition or new business opportunity may require a substantial investment of capital  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and its ability to implement its existing business strategy  and may involve the issuance of equity interest in the company or its subsidiaries  which would be dilutive to holders of common stock 
such an investment could also result in operating losses for the company 
there can be no assurance that any significant business expansion  acquisition or new business strategy would ever be profitable  and a failure by the company to recover its investment required could have a material adverse effect in the company s business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
acquisitions and investments also involve a number of other risks that could adversely affect the company s operating results  including the diversion of management s attention  the assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired companies  the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
in addition  any such acquisition or investment that is not favorably received by consumers or other persons such as advertisers with whom the company does business could damage the company s reputation or the sportsline brand 
there can be no assurance that any businesses acquired by the company will be successfully integrated or that the company will be able to consummate future acquisitions on satisfactory terms 
risks associated with international expansion the company intends to continue to expand internationally and expects that its international operations will be subject to most of the risks inherent in its business generally 
there can be no assurance that revenue from international operations will increase in the future or that operating losses will not be incurred from such operations 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets  such as changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences and difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations  and there are likely to be different consumer preferences and requirements in such markets 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors would not have a material adverse effect on the company s current or future international operations and  consequently  on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
intellectual property  risk of third party claims for infringement the company s performance and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degree on its internally developed content and technology 
the company relies on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with its employees and with third parties and contractual provisions to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate  that the company will be able to secure trademark registrations for all of its marks in the united states and or foreign countries  or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate the company s copyrights  trademarks  service marks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  effective copyright and trademark protection may be unenforceable or limited in certain foreign countries  and the global nature of the internet makes it impossible to control the ultimate destination of the company s services 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect the company s trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not bring copyright or trademark infringement claims against the company  or claim that the company s use of certain technologies violates a patent 
if it is determined that the company has infringed upon a third party s proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that any necessary licenses or rights could be obtained on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
the inability to obtain any required license on satisfactory terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may also be subject to litigation to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
if competitors of the company prepare and file applications in the united states that claim trademarks used or registered by the company  the company may oppose those applications and have to participate in proceedings before the united states patent and trademark office uspto to determine priority of rights to the trademark  which could result in substantial costs to the company  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to the company 
an adverse outcome could require the company to license disputed rights from third parties or to cease using such trademark 
any such litigation would be costly and divert management s attention  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of certain of the company s proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from third parties  and prevent the company from selling its services  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  inasmuch as the company licenses a substantial portion of its content from third parties  its exposure to copyright infringement actions may increase because the company must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such licensed content 
the company generally obtains representations as to the origins and ownership of such licensed content and generally obtains indemnification to cover any breach of any such representations  however  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that such indemnification will provide adequate compensation for any breach of such representations 
in  the company was issued a united states trademark registration for its former sportsline usa logo 
the company has applied to register in the united states its current sportsline usa logo and a number of other marks  several of which include the term sportsline usa 
the company has filed applications to register sportsline marks in australia and the united kingdom 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure adequate protection for these trademarks in the united states or in foreign countries 
many foreign countries have a first to file trademark registration system and thus the company may be prevented from registering its marks in certain countries if third parties have previously filed applications to register or have registered the same or similar marks 
it is possible that competitors of the company or others will adopt product or service names similar to the company s  thereby impeding the company s ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion 
the inability of the company to protect its sportsline usa and other marks adequately would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
as part of its confidentiality procedures  the company generally enters into agreements with its employees and consultants and limits access to and distribution of its software  documentation and other proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will prevent misappropriation of its technology or that agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable 
notwithstanding the precautions taken by the company  it might be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s software or other proprietary information without authorization or to develop similar software independently 
policing unauthorized use of the company s technology is difficult  particularly because the global nature of the internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software or other data transmitted 
the laws of other countries may afford the company little or no effective protection of its intellectual property 
the company also relies on a variety of technology that it licenses from third parties  including its internet server software  which is used in the company s web sites to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party technology licenses will continue to be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of or inability of the company to maintain or obtain upgrades to any of these technology licenses could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
management of growth the company has rapidly and significantly expanded its operations and anticipates that significant expansion of its operations will continue to be required in order to address potential market opportunities 
the company expanded from five employees at january  to employees at december   and the company expects to add additional personnel in the near future 
such growth has placed  and any future growth may continue to place  substantial strain on the company s management  operational and financial resources and systems 
to manage its growth  the company must implement  improve and effectively utilize its operational  management  marketing and financial systems and train and manage its employees 
in addition  it may become necessary for the company to increase the capacity of its software  hardware and telecommunications systems on short notice 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage the expansion of its operations or that the company s systems or procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations 
any failure of management to effectively manage the company s growth would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risk of system failure  delays and inadequacy the performance of the company s web sites is critical to its reputation and ability to attract and retain users  advertisers and members 
services based on sophisticated software and computer systems often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors or failures when introduced 
any system error or failure that causes interruption in availability or an increase in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users  advertisers or members and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the attractiveness of the company s web sites to users and advertisers 
a sudden and significant increase in the number of users of the company s web sites also could strain the capacity of the software  hardware or telecommunications systems deployed by the company  which could lead to slower response time or system failures 
in addition  if the number of web pages or users of the company s web sites increases substantially  there can be no assurance that the company s hardware and software infrastructure will be able to adequately handle the increased demand 
the company s operations also are dependent upon receipt of timely feeds and computer downloads from its content providers  and any failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of such feeds and downloads  whether on account of system failure of the company  its content providers  the public network or otherwise  could disrupt the company s operations 
any failure or delay that causes interruptions in the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company relies on private third party providers to provide it with access to the internet 
any disruption in the company s internet access or any failure of the company s third party provider to handle higher volumes of users could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is also dependent upon web browsers and internet service providers isps and online service providers osps to provide internet users access to the company s web sites  and members and users may experience difficulties accessing or using the company s web sites due to system failures or delays unrelated to the company s systems 
the company s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to protect its systems against damage from fire  hurricanes  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  computer viruses and other events beyond the company s control 
although the company has developed an out of state disaster recovery plan to respond to system failures and also maintains property insurance for its equipment  there can be no assurance that the company s disaster recovery plan is capable of being implemented successfully  if at all  or that such insurance will be adequate to compensate the company for all losses that may occur or to provide for costs associated with business interruption 
any damage or failure that causes system disruptions or other significant interruptions in the company s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of its senior management and other key personnel 
the company maintains million of key man life insurance covering michael levy  the company s president and chief executive officer  and in june entered into an employment agreement with mr 
levy that continues in effect through december  however  the loss of the services of mr 
levy or one or more of the company s other executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its key personnel 
the company s future success also depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  editorial and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the company has  at times  experienced difficulties in attracting the desired number of such individuals 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract or retain a sufficient number of highly qualified employees in the future 
if the company is unable to hire and retain personnel in key positions  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to the internet industry emerging market for the company s services the company operates in a market that is at a very early stage of development  is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed competing products and services 
as is typical in the case of a new and rapidly evolving industry  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty and risk 
because the market for the company s web sites is new and evolving  it is difficult to predict  with any assurance  the size of this market and its growth rate  if any 
in addition  it is not known whether individuals will utilize the internet to any significant degree as a means of purchasing goods and services 
the adoption of the internet for commerce  particularly by those individuals and companies that historically have relied upon traditional means of commerce  will require a broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging information 
there can be no assurance that the market for the company s web sites will develop or that demand for the company s service will emerge or be sustainable 
if the market fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if the company s web sites do not achieve or sustain market acceptance  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on adoption of the internet as an advertising medium  reliance on short term advertising contracts  competition for advertisers the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from the sale of advertisements on its web sites 
the company s ability to generate advertising revenue will depend on  among other factors  the development of the internet as an advertising medium  the amount of traffic on and the membership bases of the company s web sites and the company s ability to achieve and demonstrate user and member demographic characteristics that are attractive to advertisers 
most potential advertisers and their advertising agencies have only limited experience with the internet as an advertising medium and have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to internet based advertising 
there can be no assurance that advertisers or advertising agencies will be persuaded to allocate or continue to allocate portions of their budgets to internet based advertising or  if so persuaded  that they will find such advertising to be effective for promoting their products and services relative to traditional print and broadcast media 
no standards have yet been widely accepted for the measurement of the effectiveness of internet based advertising  and there can be no assurance that such standards will develop sufficiently to support internet based advertising as a significant advertising medium 
in addition  the widespread adoption of technologies that permit internet users to selectively block out unwanted graphics  including advertisements  attached to web pages could adversely affect the growth of the internet as an advertising medium 
acceptance of the internet among advertisers and advertising agencies will also depend  to a large extent  on the level of use of the internet by consumers  which is highly uncertain  and upon growth in the commercial use of the internet 
if widespread commercial use of the internet does not develop  or if the internet does not develop as an effective and measurable medium for advertising  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
the company s advertising revenue to date has been derived under short term contracts 
consequently  the company s advertising customers can move their advertising to competing web sites or to other media quickly and without penalty  thereby increasing the company s exposure to competitive pressures 
there can be no assurance that the company s current advertisers will continue to purchase advertisements  or that the company will be able to secure new advertising contracts from existing or future customers at attractive rates or at all 
any failure of the company to achieve sufficient advertising revenue would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
there is intense competition for the sale of advertising on high traffic web sites  which has resulted in a wide range of rates quoted by different vendors for a variety of advertising services  making it difficult to project levels of internet advertising that will be realized generally or by any specific company 
competition for advertisers among present and future web sites  as well as competition with other traditional media for advertising placements  could result in significant price competition 
most of the company s advertisements to date have been sold on the basis of the number of impressions  or times that an advertisement appears in page views downloaded by users  rather than on the number of click throughs  or user requests for additional information made by clicking on the advertisement 
there can be no assurance that the company s future advertising customers will continue to pay on a per impression basis rather than on a click through basis 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s advertising customers will accept the internal and third party measurements of impressions received by advertisements on the company s web sites  or that such measurements will not contain errors 
the foregoing factors and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on continued growth in use of the internet the company s success is highly dependent upon continued growth in the use of the internet generally and  in particular  as a medium for advertising  information services and commerce 
use of the internet by consumers is at a very early stage of development  and market acceptance of the internet as a medium for advertising  information services and commerce is subject to a high level of uncertainty 
the rapid growth of global commerce and the exchange of information on the internet and online services is new and evolving  making it difficult to predict whether the internet will prove to be a viable commercial marketplace 
the company believes that its future success will require the development and widespread acceptance of the internet and online services as a medium for advertising and commerce 
in particular  the company s future financial success will be dependent on the sale of advertising on its web sites and its ability to attract and retain paying members and to sell merchandise and premium services 
there can be no assurance that the internet will be a successful commerce and information channel 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace due to inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  such as reliable network backbones  or complementary services  such as high speed modems and security procedures for financial transactions 
consumer concern over internet security has been  and could continue to be  a barrier to commercial activities requiring consumers to send their credit card information over the internet 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed on it by sustained growth 
risks associated with technological change the internet industry is characterized by rapid technological developments  evolving industry standards  changes in user and customer requirements  frequent new service and product introductions and enhancements 
the introduction of services or products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render the company s existing web sites and proprietary technology obsolete and unmarketable or require significant unanticipated investments in product development 
the company s performance will depend  in part  on its ability to license leading technologies  enhance its existing services  develop new proprietary technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of web users and advertisers and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development of web sites and other proprietary technologies entails significant technical and business risks 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting its web sites and proprietary technologies to customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
if the company is unable  for technical  legal  financial or other reasons  to adapt in a timely manner in response to technological developments  evolving industry standards  changing market conditions or customer requirements  or if the company s web sites do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
internet commerce security risks a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
the company relies on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information 
there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms used by the company to protect customer transaction data 
if any such compromise of the company s security were to occur it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a party who is able to circumvent the company s security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in the company s operations 
the company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
concerns over the security of internet transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet generally  and the web in particular  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
to the extent that activities of the company or third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could expose the company to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
there can be no assurance that the company s security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation and legal uncertainties the company is subject to various laws and governmental regulations applicable to businesses generally 
the company believes it is currently in compliance with such laws and that such laws do not have a material impact on its operations 
in addition  although there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on the internet  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is possible that more stringent consumer protection laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet  covering issues such as user privacy and expression  pricing  intellectual property  information security  anti competitive practices  the convergence of traditional channels with internet commerce  characteristics and quality of products and services and the taxation of subscription fees or gross receipts of isps 
on june   the united states supreme court held unconstitutional provisions of the communications decency act of  which  among other things  imposed criminal penalties on anyone who distributes obscene  lascivious or indecent communications over the internet 
the enactment or enforcement of other federal or state laws or regulations in the future may increase the company s cost of doing business or decrease the growth of the internet and could in turn decrease the demand for the company s products and services  increase the company s costs  or otherwise have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the applicability to the internet of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy is uncertain  may take years to resolve and could expose the company to substantial liability for which the company might not be indemnified by the content providers or other third parties 
any such new legislation or regulation or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s contests and sweepstakes may be subject to state and federal laws governing lotteries and gambling 
the company seeks to design its contest and sweepstakes rules to fall within exemptions from such laws and restricts participation to individuals over years of age who reside in jurisdictions within the united states and canada in which the contests and sweepstakes are lawful 
there can be no assurance that the company s contests and sweepstakes will be exempt from such laws or that the applicability of such laws to the company would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce 
new state tax regulations may subject the company to additional state sales and income taxes 
as the company s service is available over the internet in multiple states and foreign countries  such jurisdictions may claim that the company is required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each such state and foreign country 
the failure by the company to qualify as a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where it is required to do so could subject the company to taxes and penalties for the failure to qualify 
it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries also might attempt to regulate the company s transmissions of content on its web sites or prosecute the company for violations of their laws 
there can be no assurance that violations of local laws will not be alleged or charged by state or foreign governments  that the company might not unintentionally violate such law or that such laws will not be modified  or new laws enacted  in the future 
in addition  several telecommunications carriers are seeking to have telecommunications over the internet regulated by the federal communications commission the fcc in the same manner as other telecommunications services 
for example  america s carriers telecommunications association has filed a petition with the fcc for this purpose 
in addition  because the growing popularity and use of the internet has burdened the existing telecommunications infrastructure and many areas with high internet use have begun to experience interruptions in phone service  local telephone carriers  such as pacific bell  have petitioned the fcc to regulate isps and osps in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on the isps and osps 
if either of these petitions are granted  or the relief sought therein is otherwise granted  the costs of communicating on the internet could increase substantially  potentially slowing the growth in use of the internet 
any such new legislation or regulation or application or interpretation of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
liability for information retrieved from the internet due to the fact that materials may be downloaded from web sites operated by the company and may be subsequently distributed to others  there is a potential that claims will be made against the company for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of such materials 
such claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services in the past 
in addition  the company could be subject to liability with respect to content that may be accessible through the company s web sites or third party web sites linked from the company s web sites 
for example  claims could be made against the company if material deemed inappropriate for viewing by children could be accessed through the company s web sites 
although the company carries general liability insurance  the company s insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify the company for all liability that may be imposed 
any costs or imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to the company s common stock possible volatility of stock price the trading price of the common stock has fluctuated significantly and could be subject to future fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in the company s results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new services or products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of companies within certain industry groups such as technology companies and internet related companies in particular  and that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the trading price of the common stock

anti takeover effects of certain provisions of delaware law and the company s charter and bylaws the company is organized under the laws of the state of delaware 
certain provisions of delaware law may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
in addition  certain provisions of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation the certificate and amended and restated bylaws the bylaws may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in its best interest 
the certificate authorizes the board to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares of any series of preferred stock and the designation of any such series  without any vote or action by the company s shareholders 
thus  the board can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of the company s common stock 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of the company  since the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit the company s consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of its assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of the common stock 
other provisions of the certificate and bylaws i divide the company s board of directors into three classes  each of which will serve for different three year periods  ii provide that the shareholders may not take action by written consent  but only at duly called annual or special meetings of shareholders  iii provide that special meetings of the shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors or a majority of the entire board of directors and iv establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at annual shareholders meetings 
shares eligible for future sale a substantial number of shares of common stock currently outstanding  or issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants  are or will become eligible for future sale in the public market at prescribed times pursuant to applicable regulations or registration rights held by certain security holders 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales will occur  could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
in connection with entering into strategic relationships  particularly with athletes  the company has issued and may continue to issue warrants to purchase significant amounts of common stock 
the issuance of significant amounts of warrants in the future  particularly warrants with exercise prices below the fair market value of the common stock at the time of issuance  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition  or on the market price for the company s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
