item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview formed in  corvas international  inc corvas or the company is a biopharmaceutical firm engaged in the design and development of a new generation of therapeutic agents for cardiovascular  cancer and other major diseases 
to date  the company has not generated significant revenues from product sales and currently does not sell any commercial products 
the company has not been profitable on an annual basis since inception and expects to incur substantial additional operating losses over the next several years as the company progresses in its research and development programs 
the company s historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
in addition  there is no assurance that the company will successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture or market its products or generate sufficient revenues to become profitable on a sustained basis or at all 
at december   the company had an accumulated deficit of  results of operations total operating revenues in decreased to  from  in operating revenues in were  revenues from collaborative agreements in  which increased by  over  included i  attributable to the company s strategic alliance agreement with schering corporation schering plough to collaborate on the discovery and commercialization of orally active inhibitors of coagulation factor xa  ii  recognized pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement with schering plough regarding the design and development of oral inhibitors of a key protease necessary for hepatitis c virus replication  iii  recognized pursuant to a research and development agreement with vascular genomics inc vgi which covers a novel vascular targeting technology  and iv  attributable to the company s research and option agreement with pfizer inc pfizer to collaborate on the development of neutrophil inhibitory factor nif 
license fees and milestones in  which decreased  from the amounts  were comprised of i a  milestone payment received from pfizer upon commencement of a phase i trial of nif  ii a  milestone payment received from schering plough upon commencement of a phase i trial of an oral thrombin inhibitor  and iii license fees of  pursuant to the transfer of manufacturing activities of recombinant tissue factor to two johnson johnson subsidiaries 
the  decrease in net product sales in compared to is due to the discontinuation of tissue factor manufacturing in total operating revenues in increased over the amounts by  primarily due to a  milestone earned with respect to thrombin inhibitors 
revenues from collaborative agreements in  which increased by  from the amount  consisted of i  attributable to the company s factor xa inhibitor program with schering plough  ii  from the company s program with schering plough covering inhibitors of the hepatitis c virus  iii  recognized pursuant to the research and development agreement with vgi for vascular targeting  and iv  attributable to the company s alliance with pfizer on the nif program 
license fees and milestones in  which increased by  over  were comprised of i a  milestone payment received upon selection of a clinical development compound in the company s collaboration with schering plough for thrombin inhibitors  ii license fees of  in connection with pfizer exercising its option on the nif program  and iii license fees of  attributable to initiation of the hepatitis c collaboration with schering plough 
research and development expenditures  which accounted for of the total costs and expenses in  in and in  increased to  in from  in this  increase is primarily due to the clinical development of rnapc  the company s proprietary anticoagulant drug candidate which entered phase ii clinical trials late in  as well as research associated with the vgi technology 
manufacturing of clinical supplies for the rnap program also contributed to the increase in expenditures 
research and development costs in decreased by  from  in this decrease was primarily due to costs incurred in for the manufacture of rnapc clinical supplies that were not incurred in general and administrative expenses decreased to  in from  in this  reduction was primarily attributable to a reduction in legal and business development costs  as well as administrative recruiting and relocation expenses incurred in that were not incurred in these same factors accounted for the majority of the  increase of general and administrative expenses in compared to total other income was  in   in and  in in addition to interest income of  the amount also included  from the sale of certain equipment and materials to a johnson johnson subsidiary in connection with the transfer of manufacturing activities described above 
the fluctuations in interest income over the three year period is due to varying cash balances available for investment 
subject to the availability of additional capital  the company expects it will continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years  including increased research and development expenses as the clinical development of rnapc proceeds 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to raise any additional capital 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s operations have been funded primarily through public offerings and private placements of equity securities  revenues and milestones from collaborative agreements  license fees and interest income earned on cash and investment balances 
the company s principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents  time deposits and debt securities which  net of a restricted time deposit  totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
working capital as of december  and was  and  respectively 
available cash is invested in accordance with an investment policy set by the board of directors  which has established the objectives of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity and maximizing income 
the policy provides guidelines concerning the quality  term and liquidity of investments 
the company presently invests its excess cash primarily in government backed debt instruments and  to a smaller degree  in debt instruments of corporations with strong credit ratings 
net cash of  was used in operations for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in total costs of  in  and the recognition of  of revenue that was recorded as deferred revenue at the end of net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  in the previous year 
this difference was primarily due to the increased use of maturing investments required to fund operations in net cash provided by financing activities increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to  raised by the company pursuant to an offer for the early exercise of certain warrants 
the company expects it will continue to incur substantial additional costs in the foreseeable future  including  but not limited to  costs related to clinical trials  preclinical studies  and research and development activities 
over the next several years  the company expects such costs will result in additional operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
increased costs are anticipated as the company s multi center phase ii trial of rnapc continues 
further  the company expects that revenues in will decrease from the current levels due to reaching the contractual end of the research program on nif in march of  and the nine month extension of the factor xa funding 
however  management has determined that  in this difficult financing market  the company s burn rate should be reduced and is developing plans for various alternatives that could include  among other things  restructuring its drug discovery programs  reduction in facility costs and containment of external expenditures 
in addition  management is continuing to pursue strategic financings  as well as additional collaborative relationships 
as of december   the company believes its existing capital resources and interest earned thereon should be sufficient to satisfy its anticipated funding requirements for at least the next months  even continuing at the current burn rate 
in the future  the company may also receive additional funds through milestone payments and royalties on sales of products in connection with its alliances 
however  there is no assurance that the company will receive any additional amounts under existing or any future alliances  or that it will be successful in raising additional capital through strategic or other financings or through collaborative relationships 
in august  the company and schering plough agreed to terminate their oral thrombin inhibitor collaboration 
strategic collaborations ongoing with schering plough and pfizer provide for payments to the company if and when certain milestones are met 
in addition to future milestones  the company may also receive royalties on sales of products in connection with its existing alliances  as well as from any future alliances 
if all the milestones on all of the company s existing collaborations are met  corvas could receive a maximum of  in future milestone payments and research and development funding over the next several years 
there is no assurance that the company s existing collaborations will be successful  that the company will receive any future milestones or other payments pursuant to collaborative agreements  that the collaborations will continue since the existing agreements are terminable at the option of the collaborator upon certain events  or that the existing collaborations will be commercially successful 
in june  the company entered into an option agreement with vgi pursuant to which the company has the option through june to acquire all of the stock of vgi in exchange for corvas common stock or  in certain circumstances  a combination of cash and common stock 
the aggregate acquisition price  which is based on the timing of option exercise  ranges from a minimum of  as of december  to a maximum of  at present  the company does not anticipate that it will exercise the vgi option in if corvas elects not to  or is unable to  exercise its option  vgi may require the company to purchase of its outstanding stock for  in corvas common stock  priced at then current market rates 
if vgi requires the company to purchase this of its outstanding stock  substantial dilution to existing stockholders could result 
during the option period  corvas is making monthly option payments of approximately  to vgi 
in addition  under a research and development agreement  vgi is required to make monthly payments of  to corvas to be applied to research and development covering the vgi technology 
although the net impact of these payments is not material  the company has incurred and may continue to incur substantial additional costs to develop this technology 
to date  corvas has not demonstrated adequate proof of principle with respect to the vgi technology and  therefore  has not been in a position to enter into one or more collaborative relationships to develop and commercialize this technology and fund its further development 
the company cannot predict whether or when it will be able to establish proof of principle or whether it will be able to establish collaborative relationships on satisfactory terms  that such relationships will successfully reduce the costs associated with the research and development of this technology  that the option will be exercised  or that if the option is not exercised  that vgi would not put of its shares to corvas 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the following the scientific progress in and magnitude of its drug discovery programs  the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the costs involved in regulatory compliance  the costs of filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patents  the progress of competing technology and other market developments  the changes in its existing collaborative relationships  the company s ability to establish and maintain collaborative or licensing arrangements  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and the effectiveness of activities and arrangements of the company or its collaborative partners to commercialize the company s products 
in  the company invested approximately  in capital equipment and leasehold improvements  but anticipates significantly reduced capital spending in the company has recently executed an amendment to extend its lease for laboratory and office space through september rent paid under this amendment will reflect a reduction over the amount currently paid 
to continue its long term product development efforts  the company must raise substantial additional funding either through collaborative arrangements or through public or private financings 
the company s ability to raise additional funds through such sales of securities depends in part on investors perceptions of the biotechnology industry  in general  and of the company  in particular 
the market for securities of biotechnology companies  including corvas  has historically been highly volatile and  accordingly  there is no assurance that additional funding will be available  or  if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing securities  further dilution  possibly substantial  to existing stockholders will likely result 
the company may enter into additional collaborative relationships to develop and commercialize certain of its current or future technologies or products 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to establish such relationships on satisfactory terms  if at all  or that agreements with collaborators will successfully reduce the company s funding requirements 
in addition  the company has not attempted to establish bank financing arrangements  and there is no assurance that it would be able to establish such arrangements on satisfactory terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  the company may be required to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue one or more of its drug discovery programs  clinical trials or other aspects of its operations  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others which may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that the company would not otherwise relinquish or at prices below what the company would otherwise choose to accept for relinquishing such rights 
at december   the company had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax reporting purposes that begin to expire in the net operating loss carryforwards for state purposes  which expire five years after generation  are approximately  the company has unused research and development tax credits for federal income tax reporting purposes of  at december  in accordance with internal revenue code section  the annual utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and credits existing prior to a change in control may be limited 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  with the instruments measured at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation 
sfas becomes effective for the company on january   however the company does not believe such adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements 
year compliance many of the world s computer systems are currently coded to accept only two digit entries in the date field 
such systems will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the end of  which could lead to business disruptions commonly referred to as the year or yk issue 
the company has implemented a yk program to access the potential exposure of its current information systems  desktop systems  laboratory equipment and infrastructure 
an internal task force  established to administer this program  is in the process of investigating the company s yk readiness 
the task force has identified key vendors and suppliers  corporate partners  governmental agencies  financial institutions and communication providers to determine the extent to which the company s systems are vulnerable to failure by those third parties to remediate their own yk issues 
the company has been assessing the yk readiness of these third parties through their public statements and has requested information regarding readiness from third parties deemed to be critical 
there is no assurance that the systems of third parties on which the company relies will be yk ready  or that any system failure by such a party would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
as of december   the company has not identified any material yk issues and does not expect remediation costs  if any  to be material  however  this process is ongoing 
the company believes that its most likely worst case scenario would be if third parties do not adequately address their yk issues 
the company has developed a contingency plan to address the material risks that it has identified  which include power outages  clinical trial oversight and contract manufacturing issues 
as the company continues its evaluation of the impact of the yk issue  there is no assurance that a complete review will not identify additional costs and efforts that will be required which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  the yk issue is complex and there is no assurance that the company will be able to address any problems that may arise from the yk issue without incurring a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has limited interest rate market risk related to its fixed income investments consisting of short term debt securities held to maturity and time deposits 
see note of the notes to financial statements for information about these financial instruments 
interest income earned on the company s short term investment portfolio is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates 
the company believes that it is not exposed to significant changes in fair value because such investments are held to maturity 
the fair value of each investment approximates its amortized cost 
the company has assumed that the similar nature of its short term investments warrant aggregation of such securities for purposes of interest rate sensitivity 
the principal amount of held to maturity investments at december   which mature at various dates in  is  the related weighted average interest rate is
