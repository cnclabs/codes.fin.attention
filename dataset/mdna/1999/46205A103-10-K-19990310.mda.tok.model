item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general on august   the company launched pax tv 
pax tv is the brand name for the programming that the company provides to its owned  operated and affiliated television stations  as well as to certain cable system affiliates and satellite providers 
pax tv programming consists of family friendly traditional entertainment television programs that have had or are having successful first runs on television  as well as original programs 
prior to the launch of pax tv  the company aired long form paid programming  consisting primarily of infomercials on its television distribution system 
the company will continue to carry infomercials on pax tv at significantly reduced inventory levels 
certain of the company s pax tv stations were and continue to be operated pursuant to time brokerage and affiliation agreements 
the company s consolidated operating revenues and expenses include the operating results of time brokered stations and the advertising revenue  related sales costs and affiliation fees of certain affiliated stations 
at december   the company also owned a interest in the travel channel  llc  a cable television network joint venture with discovery communications  inc dci 
the company s interest in the operating results of the travel channel  llc has been included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on the company s sale of its interest in the travel channel in february  the company s operating data throughout the periods discussed have been affected significantly by the timing and mix of television station acquisitions throughout such periods and the costs incurred to launch and support pax tv 
the company expects its costs to remain significantly higher than prior to the launch of pax tv 
the company s primary operating costs include commissions on revenues  employee salaries  administrative expenses  and payments in respect of syndicated program rights  cable distribution  ratings services and promotional advertising 
the company s business is subject to various risks and uncertainties which may significantly reduce revenues and increase operating expenses 
for example  a reduction in expenditures by television advertisers in the company s markets may result in lower revenues 
the company may be unable to reduce expenses  including syndicated program rights fees and certain variable expenses  in an amount sufficient in the short term to offset lost revenues caused by poor market conditions 
the broadcasting industry continues to undergo rapid technological change which may increase competition within the company s markets as new delivery systems  such as direct broadcast satellite and computer networks  attract customers 
the changing nature of audience tastes and viewing habits may affect the continued attractiveness of the company s broadcasting stations to advertisers  upon whom the company is dependent for its revenue 
the company believes that its group of television stations comprises a valuable national broadcasting distribution infrastructure 
the pax tv network reaches us television households through a distribution system comprised of broadcast television stations  cable television systems in markets not served by a pax tv station and nationwide through satellite television providers 
according to nielsen television index nti  as of february  the pax tv network reached of us television households through such broadcast  cable and satellite distribution 
upon completion of pending transactions  the pax tv network will include broadcast television stations  consisting of stations which are owned and operated by the company  or in which the company has an economic interest  and non owned or operated pax tv affiliates 
the stations and pax tv affiliates which the company will own  operate or have an economic interest in will reach of the top markets and of the top markets 
additionally  the company has entered into agreements with multiple cable system operators msos  whereby the company will receive carriage of its pax tv programming in markets not currently served by the company s broadcast television station group 
the company will pay certain fees based on the number of cable television subscribers actually reached and in certain instances  will provide the msos certain amounts of local advertising airtime during pax tv programming 
similarly  the company has entered into nationwide distribution agreements with two satellite television providers who will carry pax tv to their subscribers 
the company anticipates that this additional cable and satellite distribution will provide pax tv with incremental coverage to achieve a presence in every one of the top us television markets 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount contingent or otherwise of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period

based on the advice of counsel  management believes that  in the event of a challenge by the irs of these tax positions  it is more likely than not that the company would prevail

in may  the company amended and restated its million senior credit facility which matures june in connection therewith  the company had placed approximately million in an interest bearing escrow in order to pre fund interest payments under this facility 
the company had approximately million remaining in escrow as of december  in august  the company entered into the million equipment facility which matures the first business day of october the draw down period of the equipment facility expires in august all borrowings under this facility are secured by the equipment purchased with the proceeds drawn and bear interest at the index rate plus per annum  the libor rate plus per annum or the commercial paper rate plus per annum  at the company s option 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly in arrears 
at december   the company had borrowings of approximately million outstanding under the equipment facility bearing interest at a rate of

the equipment facility requires the company to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios and make equal quarterly principal payments of one sixteenth of the aggregate unpaid principal balance commencing on the first business day of january and continuing on the first business day of each succeeding calendar quarter thereafter up to and through the maturity date  except that the final payment due shall be in an amount equal to the entire remaining unpaid balance 
the company intends to use the equipment facility to fund the majority of its capital expenditure needs through august in february  the company sold its interest in the travel channel for aggregate consideration of approximately million and realized a gain of approximately million 
of the consideration received  approximately million was utilized to pay current obligations for cable distribution rights 
the ratings for the company s programming since the launch of pax tv on august   have generally equaled or exceeded the company s preliminary estimates 
the company s initial advertising revenues have been lower than operating expenses and as a result  the company has experienced an operating deficit for this period 
the company believes that demand for television advertising was generally weak for this period and adversely affected revenues 
the company has implemented improvements to its sales and marketing strategies and procedures in order to address what management believes to be initial reluctance of certain advertisers to purchasing advertising time on pax tv  which the company believes is attributable in part to unfamiliarity with pax tv and a lack of historical ratings and demographic data for pax tv programming which many advertisers utilize in making their advertising purchases 
furthermore  a significant number of advertisers make commitments for their advertising expenditures on quarterly and calendar year cycles  and the company believes that due to the recent launch of pax tv and the other factors described above  many advertisers have not yet included pax tv in making their advertising commitments 
the company believes reluctance by advertisers to purchase advertising in pax tv will further decrease over time as more historical ratings data for pax tv becomes available  advertisers become more familiar with pax tv and pax tv more fully participates in quarterly and annual cyclical advertising expenditure cycles 
the company has also implemented improvements to its newly developed proprietary sales and billing software system to address certain initial software system difficulties experienced since the launch of pax tv which should improve the company s ability to assess and respond to the marketplace and pax tv s operations and to more effectively manage its advertising sales efforts 
the company believes that these measures should improve the effectiveness of its advertising sales efforts and should allow the company to generate higher revenues over time that are more reflective of pax tv s ratings performance to date 
the company s primary capital requirements are for the funds required to complete announced acquisitions of broadcasting properties  capital expenditures on existing and acquired properties  syndicated programming rights payments  cable carriage and promotion payments  interest and debt service payments on indebtedness and the company s working capital requirements 
the notes require semi annual interest payments at a fixed rate 
as of december   the company s programming contracts require collective payments by the company of approximately million as follows in thousands obligations for program program rights rights commitments total thereafter through   the company has also committed to purchase at similar terms additional future series episodes of its licensed programs should they be made available 
the company continues to evaluate additional programming purchases 
the company has taken steps to defer obligations on programming which it does not anticipate airing in the near term and is in discussion with certain programming distributors regarding measures which will reduce the company s current programming obligations 
as of december   obligations for cable distribution rights require collective payments by the company of approximately million over such periods as follows in thousands thereafter less amount representing interest  present value of cable rights payable  during february the cable distribution rights commitments were reduced to million after application of million of the million of total consideration received by the company in connection with the february sale of its interest in the travel channel 
the company is in discussions with certain cable mso s regarding the reduction of its cash obligations for cable distribution rights in exchange for the company s stock at a negotiated strike price 
as of december   the company had agreements to purchase significant assets of  or to enter into time brokerage and financing arrangements with respect to  broadcast properties anticipated to close in  anticipated to close in and thereafter  the completion of such acquisitions or investments in broadcast properties is subject to a variety of factors and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the receipt of regulatory approvals and there can be no assurance that any of such investments will be completed 
the company has additional purchase commitments for two stations in the aggregate amount of approximately million net of advances and escrow deposits of approximately million for which management cannot estimate the closing date primarily as a result of delays in the receipt of fcc approval of the license transfer 
these commitments relate to channel in pittsburgh  pennsylvania million  and channel in mobile  alabama million 
in addition to operating performance  the company s liquidity position is affected by its commitments to increase distribution through television station acquisitions and cable carriage agreements as well as the company s ability to liquidate certain investments in broadcast properties and dispose of certain non core assets 
the company is pursuing measures to improve its liquidity position during the next twelve months in order to continue to pursue its business strategy and to fund its operations and debt service 
the measures the company is pursuing include the sale of non core assets including several broadcasting stations  deferring or abandoning non essential capital expenditures for improvements of existing properties  deferring or restructuring payments under cable carriage agreements  and continuing its efforts to reduce operating expenses 
the company also believes it will liquidate certain investments in broadcast properties in the company believes that by implementing a combination of the foregoing measures  it should be able to preserve sufficient liquidity to address its working capital needs during the next twelve months 
should the company s revenues during such period fall short of its current expectations  or should the company fail to successfully implement one or more of the measures discussed above  the company would likely be required to take other measures to address its liquidity position  including additional asset sales and operating expense reductions 
in addition  the company continually evaluates opportunities for raising additional capital through offerings of debt  equity and preferred stock 
the company cannot be sure that it will be able to successfully implement any such measures or that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its needs during the next twelve months in the event its advertising revenues fall significantly short of its current expectations 
the company will likely require additional financing to pursue its business strategy and fund its capital requirements in the year and thereafter 
the amount of additional financing needed could be increased to the extent that the company pursues additional acquisitions or requires additional working capital as a result of higher than expected operating costs  lower than expected advertising revenues  additional programming rights obligations and payments under additional cable carriage agreements 
the company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to it 
if the company fails to maintain sufficient liquidity to finance its future cash requirements  the company s ability to pursue its business strategy during the year and thereafter could be adversely affected 
year considerations the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions to operation 
state of readiness the company has identified four major categories of year risk software systems these include the company s revenue system traffic system  financial system eg general ledger  accounts payable  fixed assets  etc  digital cable transmission and automation systems for video servers  equipment with embedded chip technology these include on air equipment eg  video servers  compression gear  transmitters  etc  computer hardware and generators  external vendors and suppliers these include satellite transmission operators  cable television operators  and other third parties whose system failures potentially could have a significant impact on the company s operations  and facilities these include fire alarm systems  phone systems and access control systems 
the company has substantially completed its inventory of software systems and equipment and has identified external vendors and suppliers whose system failures could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company has substantially completed its assessment and is in the process of completing the remediation of all mission critical systems and equipment 
in  the company replaced its traffic system with a system that is year compliant 
the company is currently replacing its financial system with a year compliant system which is expected to be operational by june  the implementation of these new systems minimizes the possibility of year issues significantly interrupting normal operations 
the company has already received assurances as to year compliance from identified external vendors and suppliers and is currently evaluating their compliance programs 
the objective of the company is complete assessment  remediation  testing and certification of third party software for all mission critical systems and components by june  over the next few months as the company receives more information on the extent of year compliance by external vendors and third party suppliers  the nature of any contingency plans that may be needed will evolve 
the company is currently preparing contingency plans to identify and handle its worst case scenarios 
it expects to complete these plans by june  in conjunction with the completion of its assessment  remediation  testing and certification phases 
risks and costs based on its current efforts  the company does not believe that year issues will have a material adverse effect on the results of its operations  liquidity  or financial condition 
however  this assessment is dependent on the ability of third party suppliers and others whose systems failures potentially could have an impact on the company s operations to be year compliant 
although the company cannot control the conduct of external vendors and suppliers  the company expects to reduce the company s level of uncertainty and the adverse effect that any such failures may have
