it is important to note that the company s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
you should consult the risk factors described from time to time in the company s reports on sec form q  as well as those disclosed in the discussion above  under the heading factors that may affect results and financial condition and below  under the heading year update and additional factors that may affect results and financial condition 
the components of the company s statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of net sales  are as follows years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses engineering  research and development selling  general and administrative in process research and development impairment of long lived assets total operating expenses operating income loss interest income other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss results of operations years ended december   and net sales the company  along with the semiconductor equipment industry in general  is currently experiencing a downturn caused by a number of factors  including economic conditions in asia  excess capacity in the fabrication process  semiconductor pricing pressures  and the growth of the sub pc 
these factors  among others  have all combined to reduce customer spending on new capital equipment which has affected the company s sales over the last two and a half years except for a brief upturn in the latter part of net sales were million in  as compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was due to lower prober unit sales resulting from the industry downturn that has been affecting the company s sales throughout the decrease in net sales in was offset partially by incremental revenues generated from the yield management and inspection system businesses that were acquired in may and december  respectively 
net sales were million in  as compared to million in excluding knights software sales  prober sales decreased in due to lower system sales resulting from the industry downturn that negatively impacted the company s sales from the third quarter of through the second quarter of net sales were comprised of prober systems million  million and million for  and  respectively  aftermarket sales  consisting primarily of service  spare parts and upgrades in support of the prober business million  million and million for  and  respectively and knights software and techne inspection systems million and million for and  respectively 
international sales represented  and of net sales for the years  and  respectively 
the company s international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales in however  asian economic conditions may continue to have a significant adverse impact on international revenues in gross profit gross profit was  and as a percentage of sales for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit in as compared to primarily reflects the impact of the company s under absorbed manufacturing overhead resulting from lower net sales 
additionally  gross profit in was negatively impacted by approximately million of charges to write down manufacturing inventory resulting from rapid product transition from the older horizon models to the newer furthermore  gross profit was impacted by lower gross margins on inspection systems as a result of million of capitalized profit in inventory arising from the acquisition of techne that was recorded in cost of sales in the second quarter of when the systems were shipped 
the decrease in gross profit in as compared to  was primarily attributable to a change in sales mix from higher margin  more mature products to the horizon  which has lower margins due to higher material costs 
lower warranty costs in partially offset the negative impact of the change in sales mix 
the company believes that its gross profit will continue to be affected by a number of factors  including competitive pressures  changes in demand for semiconductors  changes in product mix  level of software sales  and excess manufacturing capacity costs 
engineering  research and development the company s engineering  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  project materials  consultant fees and other costs associated with the company s research and development efforts 
engineering  research and development expenses were  and as a percentage of sales for  and  respectively 
the increase in was due mainly to continuing investment in the horizon micro and mm programs  and incremental research and development costs related to the yield management software and inspection products businesses acquired in the company believes that in order to remain competitive it must continue to invest substantially in research and development through the downturn 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to the addition of knights expenses associated with the development of yield management software 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  and as a percentage of sales for  and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to higher incremental operational expenses and goodwill amortization related to the software and inspection products businesses acquired in on lower sales 
in addition  million of costs associated with severance compensation and facilities consolidation were charged during the increase in sg a expenses in compared to was due primarily to the addition of knights operations and intangible amortization related to the knights acquisition in in addition  the company accrued million for environmental remediation costs related to the clean up of its leased property in santa clara  california in the remaining increase in was due to additional marketing support and higher worldwide sales expenses 
interest income interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in each year was principally the result of increasing average cash balances and a shift to higher yielding taxable instruments during in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of knights technology  inc  and techne systems  inc  the company wrote off in process research and development totaling million and million  respectively 
see note under notes to consolidated financial statements 
these amounts were expensed on the acquisition dates because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
the company is using the in process research and development to create new process management tools 
knights at the date of acquisition  knights in process research and development related to two primary research and development programs that were expected to reach completion between late and these projects related to various stages of development of knights yield management and cad navigation software 
at the acquisition date  total estimated cost to complete was approximately million 
at december   the company estimates that it has spent million and will spend an additional million in research and development over the next three years to complete the acquired in process research and development 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
additionally  these projects will require maintenance expenditures when and if they reach a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
to date  the company has not had the expected success in commercializing the in process research and development and has significantly revised downwards its forecasts of future cash flows since the acquisition date 
techne at the date of acquisition  techne s in process research and development related to two primary research and development programs that were expected to reach completion between late and these projects related to various stages of development of techne s microstructure  bump and sort wafer inspection tools 
at the acquisition date  total estimated cost to complete was approximately million 
at december   the company estimates that it has spent million and will spend an additional million in research and development over the next year to complete the acquired in process research and development 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
additionally  these projects will require maintenance expenditures when and if they reach a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
to date  the company has not had the expected success in commercializing the in process research and development and has significantly revised downwards its forecasts of future cash flows since the acquisition date 
value assigned to in process research and development the value assigned to in process research and development was determined by estimating the costs to develop knights and techne s purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue estimates used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value are based on knights and techne s weighted average cost of capital 
given the nature of the risks associated with the estimated growth  profitability and developmental projects  knights and techne s weighted average cost of capital was adjusted 
a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for knights  while a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for techne 
these discount rates are intended to be commensurate with each company s corporate maturity and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above 
the estimates used by the company in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions the company believes to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
the company s assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
any such variance may result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
impairment of long lived assets in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded asset impairment charges of million 
the charge principally relates to long lived assets  including goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisitions of techne systems  inc and knights technology  inc 
the charges were recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
standard requires that the company analyze whether the cash flows attributable to an asset support the value assigned to that asset in the financial statements 
where estimated cash flow is not sufficient to recover the asset s net carrying value  a fair value approach is taken towards reassigning a carrying value to the asset 
during the second half of  the company did not receive any orders for a new techne inspection product being developed 
consequently  there were no inspection products in backlog at the end of the year and there is significant uncertainty as to future orders 
in light of this  the company re evaluated its forecast for such products 
the company expects that it will not be able to recover the carrying value of the long lived assets related to techne  and recorded an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of in addition  the company experienced lower than expected sales of knights products  which resulted in an operating loss for knights in in light of this  the company reevaluated its forecast for knights products 
the company expects that it will not be able to recover the carrying value of the long lived assets related to knights  and recorded an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of income taxes the income tax benefit as a percentage of income was in income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes exclusive of the non deductible in process research and development expenses were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate benefit in compared to was primarily due to the lower percentage impact of tax exempt investment income and the valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in compared to was primarily due to increased benefits of tax exempt investment income and the research and development tax credit 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance of million against its net deferred tax assets at december  due to uncertainties surrounding their realization 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  cash generated from operations was million  which resulted primarily from changes in working capital accounts partially offset by the net loss 
accounts receivable generated million as a result of improved asset management and lower revenues 
inventories decreased by million due primarily to lower sales volume in the later half of compared to the same period in and the million write down of inventory resulting from rapid product transition 
these cash generating assets were partially offset by a decrease in accrued liabilities and accounts payable of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accounts payables and accrued liabilities was due to lower production levels and headcount reflecting lower anticipated business volumes 
in addition  an increase in taxes receivable consumed million of cash 
cash used by investing activities was million due primarily from the transfer of million of cash to restricted cash  as a requirement of the lease agreement for the construction of the company s san jose campus see below and note under notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s net maturities of investments of million was offset by capital expenditures of million for engineering design and test equipment  manufacturing leasehold improvements  and enhancement of the company s information technology infrastructure 
cash used by financing activities was million 
the cash used by financing activities resulted from the net payment of short term borrowings of million by the company s japanese subsidiary  the repurchase of an additional  shares of the company s common stock at a cost of million  partially offset by the sale of common stock of million under employee stock plans 
at december   the company s japanese subsidiary had lines of credit with japanese banks with a total borrowing capacity of approximately million denominated in yen 
amounts outstanding under these facilities at december  were million 
these facilities enable the company s japanese subsidiary to finance its working capital requirements locally 
in march  the company entered into a million five year operating lease for approximately acres of land in san jose  california 
on july   the lease agreement was amended to provide a construction allowance of million for certain buildings currently under construction on the land 
the monthly payments are based on the london interbank offering rate libor 
at current interest rates and based on the lease amount of million at december   the annual lease payments currently represent approximately million  which will increase as the construction funding increases throughout the construction period of to months 
at the end of the lease  the company has the option to purchase the land and buildings at approximately million 
the guaranteed residual payment on the lease is approximately million 
the lease contains certain restrictive covenants 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
in connection with the lease collateral requirements  the company was required to collateralize the lease 
at december   the company collateralized million  which is included in other assets as restricted cash 
the amount of collateralization will increase as funding increases over the construction period 
historically  the company has generated cash in an amount sufficient to fund its operations 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources and cash flow generated from future operations will enable it to maintain its current level of operations and its planned operations including capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
year update the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in computer systems as the year approaches 
the year problem is pervasive and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with the year problem 
the company currently is in the process of auditing its own information technology infrastructure for year readiness  including reviewing what actions are required to make all software systems year ready as well as actions needed to mitigate the risks of year such actions include a review of vendors contracts  attention to year issues in future contracts with vendors  and formal communications with suppliers requesting that they certify that their products are year ready 
state of readiness the company has been actively addressing the year issues 
the following sections broadly address year matters with respect to the company s a information technology systems  b suppliers  c products  and d facilities and infrastructure for year readiness assessment 
information technology systems the company has upgraded  or is in the process of upgrading or replacing  many of its core business applications systems 
a year ready upgrade to the company s enterprise resource planning system was completed in the third quarter of year ready upgrades exist for most of the company s remaining core applications systems  and the company plans on upgrading these systems by june the company s wide area network requirements are provided by major national and international carriers  and the company expects these carriers to be year ready 
during fiscal and  the company invested in a desktop upgrade program 
the standard personal computers  servers and laptop computers installed during this period are year ready to the extent the vendors have affirmed 
although not every desktop application has been fully tested as of the filing date  the company believes that the number of non ready systems is small 
the company expects it will complete its assessment and replacement of these systems by june over the past several years  the company has replaced or upgraded its local pbx and voice mail systems to year ready systems 
the company is in the process of verifying year readiness of these systems in the company s domestic and international sales offices  and intends to complete its assessment by june suppliers during fiscal  the company sent year readiness questionnaires to its suppliers 
to date  the company has received responses from over of its major suppliers  most stating that they will be year ready 
the company expects to initiate follow up communications in the first quarter of with the suppliers that did not respond to the year readiness questionnaire 
supplier responses to the questionnaire will be closely monitored 
in some cases  alternate suppliers may need to be identified by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to find suitable alternate suppliers and contract with them on reasonable terms  or at all  and such inability could have a material and adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations 
products the company s year product testing is ongoing 
the company is using two nationally and industry recognized test procedures to verify that the company s products are year ready 
they are the ymark program nstl  for pc based products  and the sematech year readiness test scenarios for all products 
the company notified its customers of known risk areas and proposed remediation plans during the fourth quarter of the company plans to make year upgrades available to customers during the first quarter of  and to have upgrades installed in the field in there can be no assurance that the company s products will contain all necessary date code changes 
any failure of the company s products to perform  including system malfunctions due to the onset of year  could result in claims against the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the company s customers could choose to convert to other year ready products in order to avoid such malfunctions  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
facilities and infrastructure the company is in the process of assessing its year risk with respect to building automation  electronic security  water and utility systems 
the company plans to send formal queries to landlords  local fire departments  and water and utility providers in the first quarter of the company is primarily an assemble to order manufacturing operation 
there is no significant automated assembly equipment on its manufacturing shop floor 
the company is in the process of reviewing its manufacturing operations for potential year issues and plans to complete such assessment by the end of march costs to address year issues the company is in the process of identifying for its customers the corrective measures necessary to ensure that its installed products are year ready 
in this regard  the company is incurring  and will continue to incur throughout  various costs to provide customer support regarding year issues  and certain of such costs are expected to be borne not by the company but  instead  to be passed on to the customers 
the full cost of these activities  including corrective measures  is not fully known 
however  costs incurred to date have not been material and the company believes that the potential future financial impact of assuring such year readiness will not be material 
the company is continuing its assessments and developing alternatives that will necessitate refinement of this estimate over time 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the efforts described in this section 
since the efforts described in this section are ongoing  all potential year complications have not yet been identified 
therefore  the potential impact of these complications on the company s financial condition and results of operations cannot be determined at this time 
if computer systems used by the company or its suppliers  the product integrity of products provided to the company by suppliers  or the software applications used in systems manufactured and sold by the company  fail or experience significant difficulties related to the year  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected 
contingency plans the company currently is in the process of preparing contingency plans for the year readiness issues noted above and the company anticipates completing those plans by december there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent the occurrence of year problems  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
euro the company has established a team to address issues raised by the introduction of the single european currency euro for initial implementation as of january   and through the transition period to january  the company expects to be able to meet related legal requirements by january   and through the transition period 
the company does not expect the cost of system modifications to be material and does not currently expect that introduction and use of the euro will materially affect its foreign exchange activities or will result in a material increase in transaction costs 
the company will continue to evaluate the impact over time of the introduction of the euro  however  based on currently available information  management does not believe that the introduction of the euro will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or the overall trends in results of operations 
additional factors that may affect results and financial condition the company s future operating results may be affected by inherent uncertainties that exist in the worldwide semiconductor equipment industry 
such uncertainties include  but are not limited to  unexpected additional environmental remediation expenses in the event the current remediation efforts need to be expanded or ongoing investigation reveals additional contamination  timely availability and acceptance of new hardware and software products  capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  changes in demand for semiconductor products  competitive pricing pressures  product volume and mix  development of new products  enhancement of existing products  global economic conditions  availability of needed components  availability of skilled employees  timing of orders received  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  financial instability in asian markets  introduction of competitors products having technological and or pricing advantages  and the integration of the businesses of knights and techne into the company 
in addition  the company has experienced  and may in the future experience  significant fluctuations in its quarterly financial results 
accordingly  recent historical operating results should only be one source of information when evaluating the future financial performance of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s interest rate risk at december   the company s cash equivalents and short term investments consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
the company maintains a strict investment policy which ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and may decline in value when interest rates change 
the table below presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s investment portfolio 
dollars in thousands total fair value cash equivalents fixed rate    average rate short term investments fixed rate     average rate preferred stock fixed rate    average rate restricted cash variable rate    average rate total investment securities     average rate foreign currency exchange rate risk the current foreign exchange exposure in all international operations is deemed to be immaterial 
the company believes the impact of a change in exchange rates would not be material to the company s financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge its current foreign exchange exposure
