item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a worldwide leader in the design  manufacture and marketing of high performance bicycle suspension products 
substantially all of our historical revenues have been attributable to sales of mountain bike front suspension forks 
our two principal channels of distribution are i sales to oems and ii sales to distributors and ibds the retail accessory market 
a large portion of our sales are to a small group of oem customers 
we have substantial export sales  a significant portion of which include products shipped to asian manufacturing subcontractors for certain us based oems 
we believe that a substantial portion of these products are ultimately shipped back to the us and sold domestically by oems 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of the product and  to date  product returns have not been material 
our gross margins are generally higher on retail accessory market sales compared to oem sales  oem sales generate higher unit volume  which allows us an opportunity to capitalize on manufacturing efficiencies 
research  development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth operations data as a percentage of net sale for the periods indicated 
years ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense research  development and engineering expense 
restructuring and non recurring charges income loss from operations fiscal year ended march  fiscal compared to fiscal year ended march  fiscal net sales 
net sales for the year ended march  decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended march  oem sales decreased in fiscal by to million compared to million in fiscal sales to the retail accessory market ibds decreased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these decreases reflect continued softness in the overall domestic and international mountain biking market 
export sales  a significant portion of which included products shipped to asian manufacturing subcontractors for certain us based oems  accounted for approximately and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal  decreased to compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to fixed overhead costs not being fully absorbed due to lower than anticipated sales  manufacturing inefficiencies encountered during fiscal  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory in fiscal in addition  fiscal had a higher percentage of ibd sales compared to fiscal ibd sales generally have a higher gross margin than oem sales due to discounts given to oem customers 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense for fiscal increased by to million or approximately of net sales compared to million or approximately of net sales for the prior year 
the year to year increase over the same period last year is primarily a result of lower than expected sales  new software  and recruiting of some members of senior management 
sg a expense for fiscal included moving costs of  associated with the closing of two of our facilities and moving to a single larger facility in december research  development and engineering expense 
research  development and engineering r d expense for fiscal remained constant at million which represented approximately of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal the increase in r d expense as a percentage of sales was principally due to lower sales during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
restructuring and non recurring charges 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we incurred a restructuring charge of approximately million 
restructuring costs of  consisted of costs related to a planned headcount reduction of approximately employees  estimated losses associated with vacating certain of our leasehold premises  the write off of associated leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures no longer being used  totaling million  and an impairment charge of  relating to property and equipment used for production of certain discontinued products 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march   we reversed  primarily due to lower than expected severance costs and equipment write downs 
this reversal represents the unused portion of the million set aside during fiscal for the restructuring program 
interest income 
for the years ended march  and  the company had interest income of  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily attributed to lower cash balances from lower revenue during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
income tax benefit expense 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit compared to a expense for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the operating loss recorded by us in fiscal and was also due to certain capital investment tax credits

net sales for the year ended march  decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended march  oem sales increased in fiscal by to million compared to million in fiscal sales increases with certain oem customers were substantially offset by a significant decline from two large domestic oem customers 
oem sales were impacted by a soft domestic mountain bike market 
sales to the retail accessory market decreased by to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was principally due to soft domestic sales to distributors and dealers 
export sales  a significant portion of which included products shipped to asian manufacturing subcontractors for certain us based oems  accounted for approximately and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross margin

in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred a non recurring charge of million related to the termination of an incentive based bonus plan the bonus plan with the former president and former vice president of advanced research upon completion of the company s ipo 
interest income expense 
for the year ended march   we had interest income of  for the year ended march   we incurred net interest expense of million which included the amortization of capitalized financing costs 
the change was principally due to the elimination of our outstanding debt upon the closing of the company s ipo in october income tax expense 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the decrease was principally due to certain capital investment tax credits and a lower state tax rate

during fiscal  we recognized a one time pre tax charge  reflected as an extraordinary item  from the write off of capitalized financing costs  totaling approximately million before income taxes  in connection with the repayment of all of our outstanding debt that occurred in october upon the closing of the company s ipo 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended march   net cash used in operating activities was  which was comprised of the net loss of million decreased by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  offset by a net increase in working capital of million 
accounts receivable at march  increased to million net of allowance for doubtful accounts compared to million at march  the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period last year  extending longer payment terms to some of our largest customers  and granting open credit terms to some foreign customers 
inventories at march  decreased to million net of inventory reserves compared to million at march  the decrease in inventory was due to improved materials and supply chain management  as well as write offs of excess and obsolete inventory 
net cash used in investing activities was million which principally consisted of acquisitions of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was  which represented net proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
capital expenditures totaled million for fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease in capital expenditures principally related to purchases of manufacturing equipment in fiscal that allowed us to bring in house certain manufacturing processes previously performed by subcontractors 
as of march   we had purchase commitments of approximately million primarily for tooling and machinery to be used in manufacturing beginning in fiscal  which commitments are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations or available cash balances 
on september   we entered into a bridge loan note agreement providing for borrowing up to million 
on october   million was borrowed against the note  of which million was repaid on october   and the remaining million was repaid by december  on that date  we entered into a new credit agreement providing for borrowing up to million against this credit facility  which expires on december  any outstanding amounts under the facility are collateralized by our accounts receivables  inventory  equipment and intangibles 
there were no outstanding borrowings against the new credit facility as of march  at march   we had cash of million and working capital of million 
we believe that our current cash balances and or financing sources available will be sufficient to provide operating liquidity for at least the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be recognized at fair value in the balance sheet  and that the corresponding gains or losses be reported as a component of comprehensive income 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after june  currently  we do no hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee  or acsec  released statement of position  or sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires companies to capitalize certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  provided that these costs are not research and development 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the requirements of sop and the effects  if any  on our current policies on accounting for software costs 
in april  acsec released statement of position  or sop  accounting for costs of start up activities 
sop requires the costs of start up activities to be expensed as incurred 
start up activities are defined as those one time activities related to opening a new facility  introducing a new product or service  conducting business in a new territory  conducting business with a new class of customer  initiating a new process in an existing facility  or commencing some new operation 
sop is effective for our fiscal year  and the adoption of sop will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
selected quarterly financial data  seasonality the following table presents selected quarterly financial information expressed in thousands  except per share data for the last eight fiscal quarters 
we have prepared this information on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements and it includes all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the results of such quarters 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any entire year

    net income loss     net income loss per share basic shares used in per share calculations basic     net income loss per share diluted shares used in per share calculations diluted     because of our fluctuation in sales  historical quarterly operating results do not reflect management s expectations of future quarterly operating results 
management believes that future operating results will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors  including seasonal cycles associated with the bicycle industry  the effects of weather conditions on consumer purchases  the timing of orders from oems  distributors and ibds  the number and timing of new product introductions  and changes in the mix of products ordered and re ordered by oems  distributors and ibds 
management anticipates that our sales will normally be lowest in our first and fourth fiscal quarters  which end on june and march  respectively 
inflation we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on the company in the past  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case in the future 
impact of the year as many computer systems and other equipment with embedded chips or processors use only two digits to represent the year  they may be unable to process accurately certain data before  during or after the year the year 
as a result  business entities are at risk for possible miscalculations or systems failures causing disruptions in their business operations 
this is commonly known as the year issue 
the year issue can arise at any point in our supply  manufacturing  processing  distribution  and financial chains 
we have identified our year risk in three categories internal enterprise resource planning software  other internal software and imbedded chip technology  and external noncompliance by customers and suppliers  service providers and contractors 
internal enterprise resource planning software 
during the current fiscal year  we replaced our legacy information system with an enterprise resource planning system which our software vendor oracle has indicated is year compliant 
we expect to be in full year compliance with internal financial systems before the year the cost of this system conversion was approximately million  of which million was capitalized 
all other internal systems have been evaluated and have been deemed year compliant 
however  if the oracle software and other internal software are found not to be year compliant  the year could have a material impact on our operations 
internal enterprise software failures may result in loss of revenues  or an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
other internal software and imbedded chip technology 
over the last three years  our information technology group has ensured that all system upgrades  software purchases and replacements have been year compliant 
the costs associated with these upgrades  software purchases and replacements are part of the normal course of business 
we have identified most of the year compliance issues with regard to other internal software and imbedded chip technology  such as manufacturing equipment  all desktop systems and security equipment 
for those issues identified  contingency plans have been developed and implementation and testing is in process by the information technologies department 
implementation includes the replacement of software and hardware with upgraded year compliant versions and is expected to be completed by june  if we are unable to achieve year compliance for other internal software  the year could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
failure to complete the implementation may result in loss of revenues  or an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
external noncompliance by customers and suppliers  service providers and contractors 
we specifically procurement are in the process of identifying and contacting our critical suppliers to determine the extent of their plans and progress in addressing the year problem 
responses to date have indicated that the majority of vendors are year compliant 
to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  we intend to change suppliers  service providers and contractors to those that have demonstrated readiness  however  we cannot be assured that we will be successful in finding such alternative suppliers  service providers and contractors 
we have sent approximately formal letters requesting information concerning the year compliance status of our top customers 
to date  essentially all significant customers have replied  indicating in writing that they expect to be year compliant on a timely basis 
in the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  and we are unable to replace them with new customers or alternative suppliers who have demonstrated year readiness  our business or operations could be adversely affected 
these effects could lead to  but are not limited to  loss of revenues  loss of suppliers and customers  or failure to deliver products 
worst case scenarios of our failure to solve the year compliance issues could include substantial purchasing costs to develop alternative methods of managing our business and replace noncompliant equipment  temporary slowdowns or cessations of certain manufacturing operations  delays in delivery or distribution of products  delays in the receipt of supplies  invoice and collection errors  and inventory and supply obsolescence 
we are in the process of developing our contingency plan to address each of the three critical business risks outlined herein 
these plans may include shifting from replacement to remediation activities for it systems  replacing electronic applications with manual processes  developing emergency backup and recovery procedures  investing in safety stocks of key raw materials and finished goods and other measures considered appropriate by management 
these contingency plans will be continually refined as additional information becomes available 
spending necessary for year readiness is substantially complete as of march  introduction of the euro the european economic and monetary union and the introduction of a new currency the euro began in europe on january  the new currency enables the european union eu to blend the economies of eu s member states into one large market with unrestricted and unencumbered trade across borders 
the change of currencies in europe may affect our business operations in europe as well as having systems and accounting issues for the company 
we do not anticipate a material impact of the euro on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we considered the provision of financial reporting release no 
 disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at march  we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
an increase in interest rates would not significantly affect our net loss 
all of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars
