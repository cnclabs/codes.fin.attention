item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations heilig meyers company the company is the nation s largest retailer of furniture  bedding and related items and operates under four business segments heilig meyers furniture heilig meyers  rhodes furniture  the roomstore and mattress discounters 
this combination of business segments referred to as divisions has been achieved over the last three fiscal years through acquisitions and the reformatting of existing stores between segments 
the heilig meyers division is considered the company s core business 
this division locates its stores primarily in small towns and rural markets in the southern  mid western and western continental united states 
the heilig meyers furniture division offers its customers the broadest selection of competitively priced merchandise of the four divisions and approximately to of its sales have been made through the company s installment credit program 
the rhodes division locates its stores primarily in mid sized markets and metropolitan areas of southern  midwestern and western states 
the company acquired the rhodes division on december  in fiscal  eight stores and the related support facilities in the south texas region were converted to the roomstore division 
management has completed a thorough review of the rhodes operations and has implemented a plan to improve the operating results going forward 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the eight stores in colorado  which were not performing at an acceptable level  were divested 
for substantially all of fiscal  the rhodes division offered a merchandise selection that was considered higher end and more upscale as compared to the other divisions 
the promotional strategy for rhodes has been refocused in order to strengthen and expand its middle income customer base 
initiatives have been implemented to provide a stronger focus on major media advertising  more aggressive price points and event driven promotions 
the roomstore division employs a room packaging concept to value conscious families in large metropolitan markets and in puerto rico 
the roomstore division originated with the acquisition of stores in the central texas region in february that operated under the roomstore name 
this division was expanded through the conversion of stores acquired in january in the chicago area and in february in the washington baltimore area 
additionally  stores formerly operated as part of the heilig meyers division in chicago and puerto rico were transferred to the roomstore division in the fourth quarter of fiscal the former heilig meyers stores and the puerto rican stores  which operate under the berrios name  offer in house installment credit programs to their customers 
historical information presented in managements discussion and analysis has been restated to reflect the current division alignment 
mattress discounters  the nation s largest specialty bedding retailer  offers a broad selection of bedding and bedding related merchandise at a wide range of price points to consumers at all income levels 
these stores are located in major urban markets across the continental united states 
this division resulted from the acquisition of mattress discounters in july  and was expanded into the chicago market in january with the acquisition of the bedding experts  inc on march   the company announced that in an effort to substantially improve the overall financial position of the company and to refocus on its core home furnishings operation  a review of strategic divestiture options of all non core operating assets is being made 
this review includes the retention of third parties to advise on possible divestiture of the rhodes and mattress discounters divisions 
on may  the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of its interest in its mattress discounters division 
the transaction  which is subject to certain closing conditions  is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal the company will retain a interest in mattress discounters 
the cash proceeds from the sale  net of transaction costs  are estimated at million and will be used to pay down debt 
the likelihood of completing the divestiture of all or part of the rhodes division will be dependent on several factors not controllable by heilig meyers management and is uncertain at this time 
as such  the related assets of the rhodes division were considered held for use as of february  and are presented on a consolidated basis 
if an agreement to sell the rhodes division s is executed  the transaction may result in a loss and  depending on the terms of such an agreement  the loss may be material to results of operations 
management believes that  under a held for use classification  the rhodes divison s future undiscounted cash flows will be in excess of the related carrying value of its assets as of february  results of operations for the twelve months ended february  fiscal  heilig meyers company reported a net loss of million or 
per share 
this compares to a net loss of million  or 
per share for the year ended february  fiscal and net income of million  or 
per share  for the year ended february  fiscal 
the loss before benefit for income taxes for fiscal decreased to 
of sales from the loss before benefit for income taxes of of sales in the prior year  and was below the earnings before income taxes of of sales reported in fiscal results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales are as follows fiscal year other income costs of sales selling  general and administrative expense interest expense provision for doubtful accounts store closing and other charges earnings loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net earnings loss a significant component of the decrease in the loss reported in fiscal compared to fiscal relates to pre tax charges of approximately million recorded in fiscal  which are more fully described below  and a million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts 
also contributing to the decrease was a million increase in the earnings before interest and income taxes of the mattress discounters division  which had twelve months of operations in fiscal compared to seven months in fiscal the earnings before interest and income taxes of the rhodes division  however  decreased by million 
the remainder of the change is primarily due to an increase in interest expense and additional selling  general and administrative expenses recorded by the heilig meyers division related to costs associated with corporate downsizing and early retirement benefits 
the company recorded charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to a plan the profit improvement plan to close approximately heilig meyers stores  downsize office and support facilities  and reorganize the heilig meyers private label credit card program 
in connection with this plan  the company recorded a pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of approximately million  or of sales 
related initiatives caused raw selling margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal to be negatively impacted by approximately million  or 
of sales  due to inventory liquidations 
also  approximately million  or 
of sales  in selling  general and administrative expenses were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to asset write downs and other reserves 
during fiscal  the company completed the store closing plan and the reorganization of the private label credit card program 
of the million reserve balance in place at the end of fiscal  million was utilized during fiscal  with the remaining portion related to severance and lease obligations that will extend into fiscal included in the fiscal results are operating losses of approximately million incurred as these stores were closed in an orderly fashion 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company s private label credit card program was reorganized through the establishment of a new agreement with a third party to offer a revolving credit financing option to certain of the company s customers 
the company is not responsible for servicing these accounts or for any related credit losses 
the elimination of the previous program does not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the net loss for fiscal of million compared to earnings of million for fiscal the decrease between years was caused primarily by the charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal discussed above  as well as a million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
the remaining decrease between the years is the result of the additional factors noted in the discussion below 
revenues sales for fiscal compared to the previous periods are shown below fiscal year sales in thousands    sales percentage increase over prior period portion of increase from existing comparable stores portion of increase from new stores the following table shows a comparison of sales by division for the last three fiscal years fiscal year sales amounts in millions of of of of of stores sales total stores sales total stores sales total heilig meyers    rhodes the roomstore mattress discounters total      as noted above  the overall growth rate in sales decreased in fiscal as compared to the two previous years 
this trend is reflective of the current operating strategy of limiting the new store growth in the heilig meyers and rhodes divisions and the impact of acquisitions and new store growth in the roomstore and mattress discounters divisions 
sales in comparable stores  which are stores that were open for at least months  increased at a higher rate in fiscal compared to the two previous years 
the growth in total sales from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to the growth in operating units through acquisitions 
the impact of price changes on sales growth over the last three fiscal years has been insignificant 
other income the heilig meyers division and part of the roomstore division offer installment credit as a financing option to its customers 
the substantial majority of receivables generated by this program are transferred to a special purpose entity and provide a source of financing to the company through an asset securitization program  which is more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
included in other income is the compensation received by the company for servicing these accounts  the finance and related income earned on the accounts that have not been securitized  and other income earned related to non home furnishings merchandise 
the remaining stores in the roomstore  rhodes and mattress discounters divisions do not offer in house credit programs and  accordingly  make limited contributions to the other income category 
on a consolidated basis  other income decreased to of sales for fiscal from of sales in fiscal and of sales for fiscal this trend is primarily a result of the growth in the divisions in which the installment credit program is not offered 
the following table shows other income as a percentage of sales for each division fiscal year heilig meyers rhodes the roomstore mattress discounters 

the decrease in other income as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal in the heilig meyers division is due to an increase in the amount of receivables that have been securitized and the elimination of the previous revolving credit card program 
since the proceeds generated by the sale of accounts under the securitization program are used to reduce debt levels  the reduction in finance income is offset by lower interest expense 
additionally  the loss of other income from the revolving credit program is substantially offset by the elimination of administrative expenses associated with the servicing of those accounts as well as fees and commissions earned under the new revolving credit program 
the rhodes division experienced a decrease in other income compared to the last two fiscal years as a result of the repositioning effort in fiscal as part of this change in strategy  less selling emphasis was place on non furniture sales 
as a result of plans implemented in late fiscal  management expects other income generated in the rhodes division to increase as a percentage of sales in fiscal the declining trend in other income as a percentage of sales in the roomstore division is a result of the increase in stores over the last three years that do not offer an in house installment credit program 
the stores acquired in central texas in february  in chicago in january  and in the washington baltimore area in february do not offer an in house installment credit program 
management expects other income as a percentage of sales in this division to be consistent with the fiscal levels in the future 
costs and expenses on a consolidated basis  costs of sales increased slightly in fiscal to of sales from of sales in fiscal reduced costs of sales in the heilig meyers and mattress discounters divisions compared to the prior year were offset by higher costs in the rhodes and roomstore divisions 
the following table shows costs of sales as a percentage of sales for each division fiscal year heilig meyers rhodes the roomstore mattress discounters the costs of sales in the heilig meyers division include the impact of liquidation sales held in stores closed during the year 
the net effect of these liquidation events increased cost of sales by approximately 
of sales in fiscal the remaining decrease in costs of sales was a result of cost control efforts primarily in the delivery area 
as rhodes was repositioned to the higher end merchandise assortment in the first quarter of fiscal  selling margins were negatively impacted as goods from the previous assortment continued to be liquidated 
selling margins in this division were further reduced during the repositioning period in order to spur consumer demand  which was below managements expectation 
as discussed in the overview section  the rhodes promotional strategy has been refocused in order to expand its middle income customer base 
based on this plan  management expects the costs of sales in the rhodes division to decrease in fiscal the increase in costs of sales in the roomstore division reflects the growth in major metropolitan markets over the past three fiscal years 
management expects these levels of cost  as a percentage of sales  to be consistent in fiscal mattress discounters reported lower costs of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of improved buying power and increased sales of private label merchandise 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal and in fiscal the following table displays selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of the applicable divisions sales fiscal year heilig meyers rhodes the roomstore mattress discounters selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the heilig meyers division in fiscal decreased approximately of sales from the prior year as a result of asset write downs and other reserves recorded in fiscal related to the profit improvement plan 
the remaining portion of the decrease is the result of corporate downsizing actions taken in late fiscal and other cost cutting programs aimed at reducing discretionary spending 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal over fiscal was the result of the charges noted above 
the rhodes division experienced an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased costs associated with the repositioning initiative discussed above 
major components of these expenditures included employee training programs  costs to develop color merchandise catalogs  customer amenities and the sponsorship of a professional race car team 
management has eliminated these programs and as a result expects selling  general and administrative expenses in this division to be reduced by approximately million  or of sales  on an annual basis 
the decreasing trend in selling  general and administrative expenses of the roomstore division  as a percentage of sales  reflects the lower cost structures of the recent additions to this division 
these operations generally have lower cost structures because they do not administer installment credit programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in the mattress discounters division increased over fiscal primarily as a result of costs associated with new store growth 
interest expense was of sales in fiscal and and of sales in fiscal weighted average long term debt increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to the issuance of million in public debt during the second quarter of fiscal and the paydown of approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal weighted average long term interest rates for fiscal remained relatively consistent at  compared to during the prior year 
weighted average short term debt increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal weighted average short term interest rates also remained consistent at compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is mainly due to leverage on the sales by rhodes  the roomstore and mattress discounters  which were purchased with common stock 
the provision for doubtful accounts was of sales in fiscal compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is a result of charges totaling of sales recorded in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal in fiscal  the company provided an additional million for doubtful bankrupt accounts 
the company also provided for increased write offs of approximately million related to a more critical evaluation of accounts for write off in fiscal and to cover the impact of transferring the servicing of accounts from stores that were designated to close 
in addition  the company provided million in fiscal for an increase in estimated losses under the recourse provision of the heilig meyers private label credit card program that was planned for reorganization 
excluding the charges described above  the decrease in the provision as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal resulted from an increase in sales in the rhodes  roomstore and mattress discounters divisions  which utilized third party credit and  therefore  do not incur credit losses 
the volume of accounts declaring bankruptcy was million in fiscal as compared to the prior two years of million and million 
write offs and repossession losses for the on balance sheet portfolio for fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million and million were for purchased accounts 
management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts at february   is adequate 
the profit improvement plan implemented in fiscal has positively impacted the portfolios credit loss performance 
the stores that were closed in the past two years included many of the poorest performers related to credit losses 
management believes the elimination of these stores will continue to positively impact credit losses going forward 
the company is continuing to fully implement risk based scoring models to provide local store management with better tools in making credit decisions 
provision for income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was calculated by applying a percentage of compared to in fiscal the income tax rate in fiscal was 
the lower rate for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to the loss incurred during overall  the income tax rate has increased from the fiscal level as a result of the carryover tax attributes of acquired assets and liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources the company increased its cash position million to million at february  from million at february   which was million higher than the million position at february  net cash inflow from operating activities during fiscal was million  compared to an outflow of million in fiscal the company has continued to slow the expansion of its store base  which has resulted in improved cash flows provided by operating activities 
additionally  proceeds from the sales of interests in the company s installment accounts receivable through the asset securitization program provided cash inflows of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal absent proceeds from securitizations  the company traditionally produces minimal or negative cash flow from operating activities because it extends in house credit in its heilig meyers stores and certain roomstore stores 
during fiscal  installment accounts receivable increased at a slower rate than the prior year period primarily due to the closing of certain heilig meyers stores pursuant to the profit improvement plan 
during fiscal  inventory decreased compared to an increase in the prior year period 
the variation in the change in inventory between years is primarily the result of the closing of certain heilig meyers stores pursuant to the profit improvement plan  prior year purchases related to newly acquired stores and generally lower inventory levels compared to the prior year across all divisions 
investing activities produced negative cash flows of million during the twelve months ended february  compared to negative cash flows of million in the prior year period 
the decrease in negative cash flows from investing activities resulted from a decrease in cash used for acquisitions 
pursuant to the profit improvement plan  management has taken steps to slow the growth of the capital intensive heilig meyers division and lower overall spending on capital projects 
additions to property and equipment during fiscal include the acquisition of properties and equipment totaling million that were previously leased under operating lease agreements 
during the prior year period cash used for additions to property and equipment for fiscal resulted from the opening of new heilig meyers store locations and related support facilities as well as the remodeling and improvement of existing and acquired locations 
capital expenditures will continue to be financed by cash flows from operations and external sources of funds 
financing activities produced negative cash flows of million during the twelve months ended february  compared to a million positive cash flow in the prior year period 
the negative cash flow from financing activities in the current year is due to the decrease in notes payable and payments of long term debt 
in june  the company and a wholly owned subsidiary filed a joint registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission relating to up to million aggregate principal amount of securities 
there were no issuances of debt pursuant to the joint registration statement during the twelve months ended february  as of february   long term notes payable with an aggregate principal amount of million have been issued to the public under this registration statement 
as of february   the company had a million revolving credit facility in place  which expires in july this facility includes ten banks and had million outstanding and million unused as of february  subsequent to february   this facility was reduced to million 
during the year  the company had additional lines of credit with banks that totaled million 
these lines of credit were eliminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of losses incurred during fiscal years and  the company obtained amendments to its bank debt agreements in order to maintain covenant compliance 
the most recent amendment includes a revised covenant package and a provision whereby the revolving credit facility commitment will be reduced  on a dollar for dollar basis  with proceeds from asset sales until the commitment is reduced to million 
in addition  current senior note maturities of million were extended and become payable in september the company expects to repay these notes with the proceeds from the sale of assets or other financing activities 
total debt as a percentage of debt and equity was at february   compared to at february  the decrease in total debt as a percentage of debt and equity is primarily the result of the use of cash generated from operating activities including securitizations to reduce notes payable outstanding 
the current ratio was x at february   compared to x at february  the decrease in the current ratio from february  to february  is primarily attributed to the reclassification of an additional million from long term notes payable to the current portion as a result of the maturity of these amounts within the next twelve months 
other information year issue the year issue arises because many computer programs use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
using two digits could result in system failure or miscalculations that cause disruptions of operations 
in addition to computer systems  any equipment with embedded technology that involves date sensitive functions is at risk if two digits have been used rather than four 
during fiscal year  management established a team to oversee the company s year date conversion project 
the project is composed of the following stages assessment of the problem  prioritization of systems  remediation activities and compliance testing 
a plan of corrective action using both internal and external resources to enhance or replace the systems for year compliance has been implemented 
internal resources consist of permanent employees of the company s information systems department  whereas external resources are composed of contract programming personnel that are directed by the company s management 
the team has continued to assess the systems of subsidiaries as the company has expanded 
management completed the remediation stage for the critical systems of the heilig meyers operations during fiscal year completion of remediation for all other subsidiaries critical systems is expected in the second quarter of fiscal year the testing stage for critical systems within the entire company is planned for the first and second quarters of fiscal year the company is in the middle stage of inventorying and making an assessment of its non information technology systems such as telephone and alarm systems 
managers of such systems have been instructed to contact the appropriate third party vendors to determine their year compliance 
since the project s beginning in fiscal  the company has incurred approximately million in expenses in updating its management information system to alleviate potential year problems 
these expenditures represent personnel costs related to software remediation of major impact systems 
the company had previously initiated a hardware upgrade plan for desktop computers that was independent of the year issue  and  therefore  most hardware upgrades were completed under this plan 
the remaining expenditures are expected to be approximately million  which will be expensed as incurred 
expected future expenditures can be broken down as follows amounts in thousands task hardware remediation internal personnel resources software upgrades remediation auditing testing total  the remaining cost of the company s year project and the dates on which the company plans to complete the year compliance program are based on managements current estimates  which are derived utilizing numerous assumptions 
such assumptions include  but are not limited to  the continued availability of certain resources  the readiness of third parties through their own remediation plans  the absence of costs associated with implementation of any contingency plan and the lack of acquisitions by the company requiring additional remediation efforts 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual events could differ significantly from those anticipated 
the team is communicating with other companies  on which the company s systems rely and is planning to obtain compliance letters from these entities 
there can be no assurance  however  that the systems of these other companies will be converted in a timely manner  or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse effect on the company s systems 
management believes the year compliance issue is being addressed properly by the company to prevent any material adverse operational or financial impacts 
however  if such enhancements are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue may have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the company is currently assessing the consequences of its year project not being completed on schedule or its remediation efforts not being successful 
management is developing contingency plans to mitigate the effects of problems experienced by the company  key vendors or service providers related to the year management is ranking suppliers based on how critical each supplier is believed to be to the company s operations 
the company is requesting a copy of the year project plan under which these suppliers are operating 
the company s year project team will review these plans 
if a supplier is deemed to be critical and has a project plan that does not meet the company s expectations for completion  the company will examine all of the circumstances and develop a contingency plan 
contingency plans may include the identification and use of an alternate supplier of the product or service that is year compliant or the purchase of additional levels of inventory as a precaution based on the company s expected needs 
management expects to complete its year contingency planning during the second quarter of fiscal forward looking statements certain statements included in this annual report are not based on historical facts  but are forward looking statements 
these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  may  will  should  or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology  or by discussions of strategy 
see  eg  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business and legal proceedings 
these statements reflect the company s reasonable judgments with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the customers willingness  need and financial ability to purchase home furnishings and related items  the company s ability to extend credit to its customers  the costs and effectiveness of promotional activities and format realignments  the company s ability to realize cost savings and other synergies from recent acquisitions  the company s ability to complete asset sales at reasonable valuations  the ability of the investment group acquiring mattress discounters to obtain satisfactory financing for their purchase of substantially all of the company s interest in mattress discounters  as well as the company s access to  and cost of  capital 
other factors such as changes in tax laws  consumer credit and bankruptcy trends  recessionary or expansive trends in the company s markets  the ability of the company  its key vendors and service providers to effectively correct the year issue  and inflation rates and regulations and laws which affect the company s ability to do business in its markets may also impact the outcome of forward looking statements
