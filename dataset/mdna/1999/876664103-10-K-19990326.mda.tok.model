item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement the company owns a managing general partner s interest in the taubman realty group limited partnership operating partnership  through which the company conducts all of its operations 
the operating partnership owns  develops  acquires  and operates regional shopping centers nationally 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreement  development projects for future regional shopping centers and the taubman company limited partnership the manager 
shopping centers that are not controlled and that are owned through joint ventures with third parties unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
the operations of the shopping centers are best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to the company s ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
on september   the operating partnership exchanged interests in shopping centers nine consolidated businesses briarwood  columbus city center  the falls  hilltop  lakeforest  marley station  meadowood mall  stoneridge  and the mall at tuttle crossing and one unconsolidated joint venture woodfield and a share of the operating partnership s debt for all of the partnership units owned by general motors pension trusts gmpt the gmpt exchange see results of operations gmpt exchange and related transactions 
performance statistics presented below include these ten centers transferred centers through the completion of the gmpt exchange  except as noted 
because the company s portfolio changed significantly as a result of the gmpt exchange  the results of operations of the transferred centers have been separately classified within the consolidated businesses and unconsolidated joint ventures for purposes of analyzing and understanding the historical results of the current portfolio 
since the company s interest in the operating partnership has been its sole material asset throughout all periods presented  references in the following discussion to the company include the operating partnership  except where intercompany transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted  even though the operating partnership did not become a consolidated subsidiary until september mall tenant sales and center revenues over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
the company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales 
current portfolio historical portfolio mall tenant sales in thousands     sales per square foot minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs includes transferred centers through the date of the gmpt exchange 
occupancy historically  average annual occupancy has been within a narrow band 
in the last ten years  average annual occupancy has ranged between and 
mall tenant average occupancy  ending occupancy and leased space rates are as follows current portfolio historical portfolio mall tenant average occupancy ending occupancy leased space includes transferred centers through the date of the gmpt exchange 
rental rates as leases have expired in the shopping centers  the company has generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following table contains certain information regarding per square foot base rent at the shopping centers that have been owned and open for five years 
current portfolio average base rent per square foot all mall tenants stores closing during the year stores opening during the year seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents and expense recoveries relative to sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter

a one percent decrease in interest rates would increase earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
based on the company s consolidated debt and interest rates in effect at december   a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of debt by approximately million 
funds from operations a principal factor that the company considers in determining dividends to shareowners is funds from operations  which is defined as income before extraordinary and unusual items  real estate depreciation and amortization  and the allocation to the minority interest in the operating partnership  less preferred dividends 
funds from operations does not represent cash flows from operations  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity 
however  the national association of real estate investment trusts suggests that funds from operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
reconciliation of net income to funds from operations year ended december  in millions of dollars income before extraordinary items and minority interest restructuring charge depreciation and amortization share of unconsolidated joint ventures depreciation and amortization other income expenses  net non real estate depreciation preferred dividends funds from operations funds from operations allocable to the company includes gains on peripheral land sales of million for the year ended december  includes million of mall tenant allowance amortization 
includes million of mall tenant allowance amortization 
dividends the company pays regular quarterly dividends to its common and series a preferred shareowners 
dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on the cash available to the company  its financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
preferred dividends on the series a stock accrue regardless of whether earnings  cash availability  or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends 
on december   the company declared a quarterly dividend of per common share payable january  to shareowners of record on december  the board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of per share on the company s series a preferred stock  paid december  to shareowners of record on december  common dividends declared totaled per common share in  of which represented return of capital and represented ordinary income  compared to dividends declared in of per common share  of which represented return of capital and represented ordinary income 
the tax status of total common dividends declared and to be declared  assuming continuation of a per common share quarterly dividend  is estimated to be approximately return of capital  and approximately of ordinary income 
series a preferred dividends declared were and per preferred share in and  respectively  all of which represented ordinary income 
the tax status of total dividends to be paid on series a preferred stock is estimated to be ordinary income 
these are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including the amount of dividends declared  changes in the company s share of anticipated taxable income of the operating partnership due to the actual results of the operating partnership  changes in the number of the company s outstanding shares  property acquisitions or dispositions  financing transactions  including refinancing of existing debt  and changes in the internal revenue code or its application 
the annual determination of the company s common dividends is based on anticipated funds from operations available after preferred dividends  as well as financing considerations and other appropriate factors 
further  the company has decided that the growth in common dividends will be less than the growth in funds from operations for the immediate future 
any inability of the operating partnership or its joint ventures to secure financing as required to fund maturing debts  capital expenditures and changes in working capital  including development activities and expansions  may require the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations  thereby possibly reducing distributions to partners of the operating partnership and funds available to the company for the payment of dividends

estimates of future capital spending include only projects approved by the company s board of directors and  consequently  estimates will change as new projects are approved 
estimates regarding capital expenditures presented above are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to actual results of negotiations with anchors  tenants and contractors  changes in the scope and number of projects  cost overruns  timing of expenditures  financing considerations  and actual time to complete projects 
the company expects to fund the development of new centers primarily with proceeds from construction facilities

year matters the approach of the calendar year year presents issues for many financial  information  and operational systems that may not properly recognize the year the company has developed a detailed plan to address the risks posed by the year issue  covering affected application and infrastructure systems 
affected systems include both informational such as accounting and payroll and operational such as elevators  security and lighting 
the company s plan also addresses the effect of third parties with which it conducts business  including tenants  vendors  contractors  creditors  and others 
the company has completed the assessment  inventory and planning phases of its plan and has determined that the majority of the company s internal systems and all of its mission critical systems are already year compliant 
the company has requested information and has obtained commitments from its national tenants and the majority of its critical vendors and suppliers  and is continuing to develop alternative solutions to minimize the impact on the company in the event they do not meet their year commitments 
the company expects to remediate any remaining issues encountered with application and infrastructure systems through repair and or replacement  and plans to perform a full system test by the end of the first quarter 
the estimated costs of addressing the year issue were not material to and are not expected to be material to operations 
the company will also continue monitoring the progress of material third parties responses to the year issue 
the company believes that its most likely exposure will be the failure of third parties in comprehensively addressing the issue 
for example  failure of utility companies to meet their commitments might result in temporary business interruption at centers 
the company is continuing to develop contingency plans in response to such exposure  as appropriate 
failure of third parties with which the company conducts business to respond successfully to the year issue may have a material adverse effect on the company
