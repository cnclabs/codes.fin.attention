selected financial information for the years ended december  dollars in thousands contracts purchased during year    average monthly purchases during the year    gain on sale of contracts    total revenue    contracts securitized during the year    servicing portfolio at year end    total revenue is comprised of net interest income  servicing fee income and gain on sale of contracts 
contracts purchased and servicing portfolio since its inception  the company has experienced significant growth in its purchased volume of contracts 
acquisition volume for the year ended december   was  million compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of from to this growth in acquisition volume is attributable primarily to i the opening of four additional auto finance centers during and ii an increased penetration of existing dealers due to the maturation of existing relationships 
the company s increase in contract acquisition volume has resulted in the growth in the company s servicing portfolio 
the servicing portfolio at december   was  million compared to million at december   an increase of 
net interest income net interest income consists primarily of the difference between the rate earned on contracts held on the balance sheet during the warehousing period and the interest costs associated with the company s borrowings to finance the warehousing of such contracts 
the following table illustrates the weighted average rate earned on contracts  the weighted average rate paid on borrowings and the corresponding net interest rate spread 
net interest rate spread for the years ended december  yield on contracts cost of borrowings net interest rate spread the yield on contracts is net of dealer participation amortized expenses 
gain on sale of contracts the company computes a gain on sale with respect to contracts securitized based on the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be received from such contracts using a market discount rate 
gain on sale is recorded as a credit enhancement asset on the statement of financial condition and is amortized against servicing income over the life of the contracts 
the gain recorded in the statement of income is adjusted for prepaid dealer participation  issuance costs and the effect of hedging activities 
the company recorded gains on sale of contracts of million on the sale of million of contracts in for its securitizations 
the gain on sale of contracts is affected by the amount of contracts securitized and the net interest rate spread on those contracts

the company assumes an average prepayment speed of abs  a discount rate of bp above the weighted average investor rate  and utilizes a lifetime loss rate ranging from to of the original balance 
servicing fee income contractual servicing is earned at a rate of per annum on the outstanding principal balance of contracts securitized and is consistent with industry standards 
excess servicing income is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold and the performance of the contracts 
servicing fee income is related to the size of the serviced portfolio and also includes investment interest  extension fees  document fees and other fees charged to customer accounts 
results of operations years ended december   and the company had net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and million for the years ended december  and the increase in net income from to is attributable to several factors  including i a increase in the dollar volume of contracts securitized  resulting in an increase in gain on sale  ii higher servicing fee income due to improved performance of contracts securitized and an increase in the serviced portfolio and iii improvements in the cost structure of the company which resulted in a decline in operating expenses as a percentage of average servicing portfolio to from in the reduction in net income from to was attributable to several factors  most notably to the company s commitment to build reserves in the face of increasing delinquency and credit loss ratios related to purchases of contracts in the second half of and the first half of by one of the company s auto finance centers 
management believes that the company is adequately reserved at this time 
additionally  the losses incurred by the company during its start up phase calendar years and generated net operating loss carryforwards which were fully utilized in the unavailability of these carryforwards in accounted for a significant portion of the net income differential between and net interest income 
net interest income increased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to an increase in the average amount of contracts held for sale during as compared to and this more than offset the effect of decline in net interest margins in compared to net interest margins declined to in compared to in and in while the average amount of contracts held for sale increased to million compared to million in and million in the yield on contracts held for sale increased by to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  in addition  the company s cost of borrowings increased by to compared to at december   and at december  in addition to the interest paid on warehouse borrowings  the company includes the interest it pays on its residual line borrowings  subordinated debt  and capitalized lease obligations as components of its cost of funds 
the increase in funding costs in was due to a mix shift amongst these lines rather than to an increase in borrowings rates 
servicing fee income 
servicing fee income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a significant increase in the size of the average servicing portfolio in addition to the improved performance of secured contracts 
for the year ended december   the size of the average servicing portfolio increased to billion from million and from million for the same period in and gain on sale of contracts 
the company completed four securitizations totaling million during the year ended december   resulting in gains on sale of million compared to four securitizations totaling million during the year ended december   resulting in gains on sale of contracts totaling million  and four securitizations for the year ended december   resulting in gains on sale of contracts of million 
the average net spread on the securitizations was compared to in and in provision for credit losses 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses to cover anticipated losses on the contracts held on statement of financial condition 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the contracts held on statement of financial condition or by the sale of contracts held on statement of financial condition 
the level of the allowance is based principally on the outstanding balance of contracts held on statement of financial condition  and historical loss trends 
when the company sells contracts in a securitization transaction  it reduces its allowance for credit losses and factors potential losses into its calculations of gain on sale 
the increase in the provision for credit losses for the year ended december  as compared to december  and is a result of the increase in contracts held for sale at the end of each year 
salaries and benefits expense 
the company incurred salary and benefit expenses of million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  in order to support the growth of its operations and the servicing portfolio  the number of employees increased from at december   to at december   to at december  other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million at december   from million at december   and from million for the year ended december  the majority of increases were due to the growth of the average servicing portfolio from million to million and billion at december   and  respectively 
additionally  the company opened additional auto finance centers during the years ended december   december   and december  income taxes 
the company files federal and certain state tax returns as part of a consolidated group 
tax liabilities from the consolidated returns are allocated in accordance with a tax sharing agreement based on the relative income or loss of each entity on a stand alone basis 
the effective tax rate for onyx was in and in the reduction in tax rates between and is due to lower tax rates in the states where the company has opened new auto finance centers 
the company s effective tax rate in was as the company had net operating loss carry forwards that were utilized to reduce income tax expense 
financial condition contracts held for sale contracts held for sale totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the number and principal balance of contracts held for sale is largely dependent upon the timing and size of the company s securitizations 
the increase in the contracts held for sale from year end to year end is primarily attributable to the company s higher contract volume during the respective warehousing periods 
the company believes that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb potential losses in the owned portfolio 
the allowance for credit losses as of december   was approximately million 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for contracts held for sale and allowance for credit losses 
credit enhancement assets credit enhancement assets consisted of the following as of december  trust receivable   risa   total   investment in trust receivables represent servicer advances and initial deposits in spread accounts 
risa consists of the estimated present value of future servicing cash flows from related securitizations 
future servicing cash flows are computed by taking into account certain assumptions principally regarding prepayments  losses and servicing costs 
these cash flows are then discounted until they are released by the spread account and received by the company at a market based rate 
the balance is then amortized against actual servicing fee income on a monthly basis 
the following table provides historical data regarding the risa 
included in risa is restricted cash of million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
retained interest in securitized assets for the years ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance   additions   amortization   ending balance   asset quality the company monitors and attempts to minimize delinquencies and losses through timely collections and the use of a predictive dialing system 
at december   delinquencies represented of the amount of contracts in its servicing portfolio compared to at december   and at december  net charge offs as a percentage of the average servicing portfolio were for the year ended december   compared to and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the levels of delinquencies at december   increased over december   primarily due to the relocation of the collection and customer service areas in conjunction with the relocation of the corporate headquarters in december of the increase in delinquency from to is attributable in part to an increase on a national basis in the level of bankruptcies and consumer defaults generally  and the tendency of delinquencies and losses with respect to a pool of automobile loans to increase after a period of seasoning 
loan losses however have decreased from to  and the management of the company believes that this is a result of the elimination of significant portion of the portfolio of high delinquency and high loss contracts purchased through the third quarter of by the company s north hollywood auto finance center 
the north hollywood auto finance center had a higher concentration of used car dealerships than the company s other auto finance centers  and this concentration of used car dealerships was principally responsible for the poor performance of the portion of the company s portfolio 
the runoff of these loans impacted losses through december management has increased its off balance sheet reserves as a percentage of the average serviced portfolio sold 
reserves have increased from at december   to at december   to at december  off balance sheet reserves are those reserves established upon the sale of contracts to the grantor and owner trusts in connection with securitized contracts 
delinquency experience of the servicing portfolio for the years ended december  dollars in thousands servicing portfolio    delinquencies days    days    days    total delinquencies as a percent of servicing portfolio delinquencies include principal amounts only  net of repossessed inventory 
the period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due

net charge offs are gross charge offs minus recoveries on contracts previously charged off 
the following table illustrates the monthly performance of each of the securitized pools outstanding for the period from the date of securitization through december  month a b c liquidity and capital resources the company requires substantial cash and capital resources to operate its business 
its primary uses of cash include i acquisition of contracts  ii payment of dealer participation  iii securitization costs  including cash held in spread accounts  iv settlements of hedging transactions  v maintenance of working capital requirements and payment of operating expenses  and vi interest expense 
the capital resources available to the company include i net interest income during the warehousing period  ii contractual servicing fees  iii excess servicing cash flows released from spread accounts  iv settlements of hedging transactions  v sales of contracts in securitizations  and vi borrowings under its credit facilities 
these sources can provide capital to fund expansion of the company s contract purchasing and servicing capabilities 
the principal determinant of cash usage in a particular year is the difference between the dollar amount of contracts purchased and the proceeds from sale of contracts 
in  million more contracts were purchased than sold vs 
a million difference in  resulting in net cash used in operating activities 
in  proceeds from sale of contracts exceeded contract purchases by million  resulting in net cash provided by operating activities 
cash used in investing activities increased to million in the year ended december   from million and  in the years ended december   and respectively 
the increases resulted from higher capital expenditures by the company  principally in the purchase of furniture and equipment  in connection with the company s continued expansion 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided and million used for the years ended december   and respectively 
this increase over was primarily due to the issuance of subordinated debt  and additional borrowing under revolving credit facilities 
in  the company used excess proceeds from sale of contracts to paydown warehouse lines  resulting in net cash used in financing activities 
the company s wholly owned special purpose subsidiary  oafc  is party to a million auto loan warehouse program the cp facility with triple a one funding corporation triple a 
triple a is a commercial paper asset backed conduit lender sponsored by mbia and is currently rated a p by standard poor s ratings group  a division of the mcgraw hill companies inc  and moody s investors service  inc  respectively such ratings are not recommendations to invest and are subject to change 
this facility provides funds to purchase contracts 
the advance rate to oafc was increased during to from of adjusted eligible principal balance of each contract 
the advance rate is subject to reduction by mbia if the net yield on oafc s contract portfolio falls below a target net yield 
the remaining of the purchase price of the contracts generally is funded either from net interest income earned by oafc or by proceeds from the revolving facility or the residual lines described below 
since the cp facility is commercial paper based  the company has the ability to manage its interest rate exposure during the warehouse period between origination and securitization by determining the maturities one to days of its commercial paper borrowings 
upon the occurrence of a wind down event as defined in the cp facility documents  no further borrowings by oafc from triple a will be permitted and all collections on the contracts included in the borrowing base are distributed in substantially the same manner as before the wind down event except that all outstanding triple a advances must be repaid before any amounts can be paid to other borrowers or oafc 
unless earlier terminated upon the occurrence of a wind down event  the cp facility matures in september  subject to the requirement that the liquidity facility provided by certain banks to triple a be extended annually 
after maturity in september  the cp facility is subject to annual renewals upon mutual consent of the parties 
additionally  the company has a collateralized revolving line of credit with a lending group the revolving facility 
the facility maximum at december   was million compared to million at december  the revolving facility is used for working capital and other expenditures for which the company s million cp facility is not otherwise available 
under the revolving facility  the company may subject to borrowing base availability borrow and repay during the two year revolving period up to million based on a collateral based formula 
the interest rate is based on the lender s prime rate 
the company s obligations under the revolving facility are collateralized by a blanket lien on the company s assets 
the revolving facility contains affirmative  negative and financial covenants and other provisions typical of such credit facilities 
the revolving facility converts unless renewed by mutual consent from revolving loans to fully amortizing two year term loans on june   or  if earlier  upon the occurrence of certain credit triggers 
the million merrill line provides funding for the expansion of the purchase or origination of contracts and is used in concert with the cp facility the company currently has in place 
the interest rate is based on libor 
the merrill line has a term of one year and currently matures in february the residual lines are used by the company to finance operating requirements 
the amounts available for borrowing under each line are determined using a collateral based formula which uses a percentage of the value of excess cash flow to be received from certain securitizations  and  with respect to the mlmci facility  a percentage of the amount of the merrill line outstanding on a quarterly basis 
the interest rates are based on libor and the residual lines have a term of one year 
the facility provided by mlmci matures in february  the facility provided by sbrc matures in september as of december   the company has subordinated debt outstanding of million 
the term of the subordinated debt is for two years ending february   with an option by the company to extend the term by three years during which the loan would fully amortize 
the debt bears a fixed interest rate of 
the company also issued to the lender a warrant for common stock in the amount of  shares of the company s common stock 
securitizations the company has a securitization program that involves selling interests in pools of its contracts to investors through the issuance of aaa aaa rated asset backed securities 
the company believes that its experience in securitizations coupled with the quality of contracts acquired and the company s management information systems are instrumental in the company successfully completing aaa aaa rated publicly underwritten securitizations since october the company successfully completed four aaa aaa rated publicly underwritten securitizations in totaling million compared to four securitizations totaling million in and four securitizations totaling million in in the first quarter of  the company securitized contracts in the amount of million 
these ongoing periodic securitizations are an integral part of the company s business plan because they allow the company to increase its liquidity  provide for redeployment of its capital and reduce risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the net proceeds of these securitizations are generally used to pay down outstanding loans under the cp facility and merrill line  thereby creating availability for the acquisition of additional contracts 
in each of its securitizations  the company sells its contracts from oafc to a newly formed grantor or owner trust 
the trust in turn issues interest bearing notes and or certificates to investors in an amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
purchasers of the notes and or certificates backed by contracts receive a fixed rate of interest established at the time of the sale 
the company retains the servicing and receives a servicing fee 
interest rate exposure and hedging the company is able through the use of varying maturities on advances from the cp facility to lock in rates during the warehousing period  when in management s judgment it is appropriate  to limit interest rate exposure during such warehousing period see risk factors interest rate risk 
the company has the ability to move rates upward in response to rising borrowing costs because the company currently does not originate loans near the maximum rates permitted by law 
further  the company employs a hedging strategy which primarily consists of the execution of forward interest rate swaps 
these hedges are entered into by the company in numbers and amounts which generally correspond to the anticipated principal amount of the related securitization 
gains and losses relative to these hedges are recognized in full at the time of securitization as an adjustment to the gain on sale of the contracts 
the company has only used counterparties with investment grade debt ratings from national rating agencies for its hedging transactions 
management monitors the company s hedging activities on a frequent basis to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the company s hedging strategy requires estimates by management of monthly contract acquisition volume and timing of its securitizations 
if such estimates are materially inaccurate  then the company s gain on sales of contracts and results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by senior management based upon the amount of contracts purchased and the interest rate environment 
senior management currently expects to hedge substantially all of its contracts pending securitization 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative contracts  and for hedging activities 
the new standard requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition and that those instruments be measured at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedging instrument 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative that is  unrealized gains and losses depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the statement is effective in the first quarter of year the company is presently assessing the effect of sfas on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
year compliance the company is substantially dependent on its and third party computer systems  business applications and other information technology systems it systems  due to the nature of its consumer finance business and the increasing number of electronic transactions in the industry 
historically  many it systems were developed to recognize the year as a two digit number  with the digits being recognized as the year the year presents a number of potential problems for such systems  including potentially significant processing errors or failure 
given the company s reliance on its computer systems  the company s results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any significant errors or failures 
the company has developed and is in the midst of executing a comprehensive plan designed to address the year issue for its in house and third party it applications 
earlier this year  the company completed a detailed risk assessment of its various in house and third party computer systems  business applications and other affected systems  formulated a plan for specific remediation efforts and began certain of such remediation efforts 
the company assembled survey data from third party vendors and certain other parties with which the company communicates electronically to determine the compliance efforts being undertaken by these parties and to assess the company s potential exposure to any non compliant systems operated by these parties 
during the first half of  the company expects to continue and complete its remediation efforts and to undertake internal testing of its in house and third party systems and applications 
the company currently estimates that its costs related to year compliance remediation for company owned it systems and applications will be approximately  in the amount expected to be expended during represents approximately of the company s it budget 
as of december   the company had expended approximately  for remediation of its it software systems and applications 
by the second quarter of  the company expects to undergo third party review of its year remediation efforts 
this third party review will include an assessment of the procedures undertaken by the company as well as a computer software test of selected portions of the company s computer code 
the company currently expects that its year remediation efforts will be completed during the third quarter of the company expenses year remediation costs as incurred 
the company believes that it has an effective plan in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary processes of its year plan 
the company plans to continuously monitor the status of completion of its year plan and  based on such information  will develop contingency plans as necessary 
in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases of its plan  the company may be unable to perform its key operating activities  such as the purchase of loans and the invoicing  collecting and application of obligor repayments 
the company could be subject to litigation for computer systems failure  such as improper application of repayments and resulting incorrect credit reporting to credit bureaus 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot reasonably be estimated at this time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because the company s funding strategy is dependent upon the issuance of interest bearing securities and the incurrence of debt  fluctuations in interest rates impact the company s profitability 
as a result  the company employs various hedging strategies to limit certain risks of interest rate fluctuations
