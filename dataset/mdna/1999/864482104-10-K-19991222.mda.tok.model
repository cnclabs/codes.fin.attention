item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of the partnership 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
since the operating partnership and service company account for substantially all of the assets  revenues and earnings of the partnership  a separate discussion of the partnership s results of operations from other sources is not presented 
general the partnership is engaged in the retail and wholesale marketing of propane and related sales of appliances and services 
the partnership believes it is the third largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  serving more than  active residential  commercial  industrial and agricultural customers from approximately customer service centers in over states 
the partnership s annual retail propane sales volumes were approximately million  million and million gallons during the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased on the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to storage tanks located on the customers premises 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating  clothes drying and cooking purposes 
industrial customers primarily use propane as a motor fuel burned in internal combustion engines that power over the road vehicles  forklifts and stationary engines  to fire furnaces  as a cutting gas and in other process applications 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for tobacco curing  crop drying  poultry brooding and weed control 
in its wholesale operations  the partnership sells propane principally to large industrial end users and other propane distributors 
product costs the retail propane business is a margin based business where the level of profitability is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales prices and product cost 
the unit cost of propane is subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply or other market conditions 
propane unit cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact retail margins 
there is no assurance that the partnership will be able to pass on product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
seasonality the retail propane distribution business is seasonal because of propane s primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of the partnership s retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the partnership s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the winter heating season 
to the extent necessary  the partnership will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to unitholders in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for propane for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many customers of the partnership rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel 
accordingly  the volume of propane sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather which can vary substantially from year to year 
selected quarterly financial data due to the seasonality of the retail propane business  first and second quarter revenues  gross profit and earnings are consistently greater than the comparable third and fourth quarter results 
the following presents the partnership s selected quarterly financial data for the last two fiscal years 
fiscal unaudited in thousands  except per unit amounts first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal revenues      recapitalization costs   income loss before interest expense and income taxes      net income loss      net income loss per unit 



ebitda      retail gallons sold      fiscal unaudited in thousands  except per unit amounts first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal revenues      income loss before interest expense and income taxes      net income loss      net income loss per unit 


ebitda     retail gallons sold      ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization is calculated as income loss before interest expense and income taxes plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations and is not in accordance with or superior to generally accepted accounting principles  but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to pay the minimum quarterly distribution 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and this measure may vary among companies  the ebitda data presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues from retail propane activities decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to lower product costs which resulted in lower selling prices and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in retail gallons sold 
overall  higher nationwide inventories of propane  coupled with warmer than normal temperatures during the winter of fiscal  resulted in a significant decrease in the cost of propane when compared to the winter of fiscal temperatures during fiscal were warmer than normal and warmer than fiscal  as reported by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 
temperatures during october through march of the fiscal heating season were one of the warmest on record with temperatures being warmer than normal and warmer than the prior year period 
retail gallons sold decreased or million gallons to million gallons in fiscal compared to million gallons in the prior year 
the decline in retail gallons sold is principally attributable to warmer temperatures  principally during the winter heating season  in all areas of the partnership s operations 
revenues from wholesale and risk management activities decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is attributed to lower product costs which resulted in lower selling prices and to the partnership s reduced emphasis on wholesale marketing  due to the low margin nature of the wholesale market 
other revenues increased or million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase is attributable to higher sales of appliances and related parts and an increase in service installation revenues associated with several retail growth initiatives 
operating expenses 
operating expenses remained consistent with fiscal amounting to million compared to million in fiscal as lower payroll  benefits costs and vehicle fuel costs were offset by increased operating expenses associated with several retail growth initiatives 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
fiscal results reflect a million write off of certain impaired information system assets and a million charge related to insurance claims for which insurance coverage was denied 
excluding these non recurring items  general and administrative expenses increased million or in fiscal  principally due to higher information system expenses including costs incurred to address yk compliance and the absence of offsetting dividend income of million earned in the prior year on the sold investment in the dixie pipeline company 
recapitalization costs 
results for fiscal reflect expenses of million incurred in connection with the partnership s recapitalization transactions 
approximately million of the recapitalization costs represent amounts paid for financial advisory fees  proxy solicitation fees  legal  accounting and tax service fees and million paid to millennium to extend the scheduled closing date for the recapitalization 
the million includes approximately million of expenses paid for purchase of the former general partner s interests 
approximately million of the recapitalization costs reflect compensation expense recognized upon accelerated vesting of  issued and outstanding restricted units on the closing date of the recapitalization pursuant to the change of control provisions of the restricted unit plan 
the partnership also incurred approximately million in fees and expenses to amend its senior note agreement 
such amount has been deferred and is being amortized over the remaining term of the senior notes approximately years 
income before interest expense and income taxes and ebitda 
results for the fiscal year include million of recapitalization costs 
results for the fiscal year include a million gain from the sale of an investment in the dixie pipeline co  a million write off of certain impaired assets and a million charge related to insurance claims for which insurance coverage was denied 
excluding these one time items from both periods  income before interest expense and income taxes increased or million to million compared to million in the prior period 
ebitda  excluding the one time items from both periods  increased or million to million compared to million in the prior period 
the improvement in income before interest expense and income taxes and ebitda is primarily attributable to higher overall gross profit of million  partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses 
the increase in gross profit principally resulted from higher sales of appliances and related parts and increased service installation activities attributable to several retail growth initiatives and an increase in gains realized on the partnership s product procurement and price risk management activities  including hedging transactions 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution 
interest expense 
net interest expense remained comparable at million in fiscal compared with million in the prior year 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues from retail activities decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to lower product costs which resulted in lower selling prices and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in retail gallons sold 
overall  higher nationwide inventories of propane  coupled with warmer than normal temperatures during the winter of fiscal  resulted in a significant decrease in the cost of propane when compared to the winter of fiscal temperatures during fiscal were warmer than normal and warmer than fiscal  as reported by the noaa  which is attributable to the el nino weather phenomenon 
temperatures during january and february of the fiscal heating season were the warmest on record according to the noaa  which began keeping records over years ago 
retail gallons sold decreased or million gallons to million gallons in fiscal compared to million gallons in the prior year 
the decline in retail gallons sold is principally attributable to warmer temperatures  principally during the winter heating season  in all areas of the partnership s operations 
revenues from wholesale and risk management activities decreased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease is attributed to the partnership s reduced emphasis on wholesale marketing  due to the low margin nature of the wholesale market 
the decrease in wholesale revenues was partially offset by the increase in the partnership s product procurement and price risk management activities which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from risk management activities increased million to million in compared to million in fiscal the gallons sold for risk management purposes in fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the continued favorable impact of restructuring activities undertaken during  principally lower payroll and benefit costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million or to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million write off of certain impaired information systems assets  an increase in professional consulting services  primarily in the information systems area  and a million charge related to insurance claims for which insurance coverage was denied 
the million write off of impaired assets principally represents software and implementation costs incurred under a project to replace the partnership s retail sales system 
the project was aborted when the partnership s management determined that the software did not have the functionality and flexibility originally represented by the software vendor 
as such  the partnership never installed the new software and is continuing to use its existing retail sales system 
the partnership is currently evaluating alternatives to replace the retail sales system 
the insurance claim resulted from the collapse of the partnership s underground propane storage cavern and associated fire that occurred in hainesville  texas in november third parties who owned interests in nearby oil and gas wells sued the partnership  millennium  and other parties and claimed damage to the wells resulting from the collapse of the underground cavern and alleged brine water migration 
the partnership s insurance carrier denied coverage based upon the pollution exclusion endorsement of its policy 
the partnership settled this claim in december for million  million of which was paid by millennium 
income before interest expense and income taxes and ebitda 
results for the fiscal year include a million gain from the sale of an investment in the dixie pipeline co 
and a million write off of certain impaired assets 
results for the prior year period include a restructuring charge of million 
excluding these one time items from both periods  income before interest expense and income taxes increased or million to million compared to million in the prior period 
ebitda  excluding the one time items from both periods  increased or million to million compared to million in the prior period 
the improvement in income before interest expense and income taxes and ebitda is primarily attributable to higher overall gross profit and lower operating expenses partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses 
the increase in gross profit principally resulted from overall higher average propane unit margins and the expansion of the partnership s product procurement and price risk management activities  including hedging transactions  partially offset by reduced volume of retail propane gallons sold 
the overall higher average propane unit margins were attributable to lower product costs  resulting from a less volatile propane market during and more favorable purchasing contracts which were not fully reflected in lower retail selling prices 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligations but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to distribute the minimum quarterly distribution 
interest expense 
net interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease is attributable to higher interest income on significantly increased cash investments in fiscal resulting from higher net income  proceeds from the sale of the partnership s investment in the dixie pipeline co 
and  to a lesser extent  improved working capital management and lower product costs 
risk management the partnership engages in hedging transactions to reduce the effect of price volatility on its product costs and to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
the partnership is currently a party to propane futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange and enters into forward and option agreements to purchase and sell propane at fixed prices in the future 
these activities are monitored by management through enforcement of the partnership s commodity trading policy 
hedging does not always result in increased product margins and the partnership does not consider hedging activities to be material to operations or liquidity for the years ended september  and september  for additional information  see item a of this report 
liquidity and capital resources due to the seasonal nature of the propane business  cash flows from operating activities are greater during the winter and spring seasons as customers pay for propane purchased during the heating season 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to higher net income of million after excluding the non recurring recapitalization costs of million in fiscal and the million gain on the sale of an investment in fiscal  and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities include an increase in accounts payable of million primarily attributable to changes in the timing and payment terms on propane purchases partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and prepaid expenses of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting million in capital expenditures including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations and million of payments for acquisitions  offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  consisting of capital expenditures of million including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations and acquisition payments of million  offset by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million and million from the sale of the investment in the dixie pipeline co

in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase in net income  exclusive of non cash items  of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities reflect decreases in accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and accounts payable of million principally due to the lower cost of propane 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accrued employment and benefit costs of million reflecting higher performance related payroll accruals and an increase in deferred credits and other non current liabilities of million 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was million  reflecting million of partnership distributions and million in debt repayments partially offset by million in apu contributions received from the former general partner 
for fiscal year  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million or to million compared to million for fiscal year cash provided by operating activities during fiscal reflects increases in cash from accounts receivable of million  prepaid and other current assets of million and inventories of million principally due to lower sales volumes and a resulting decline in propane purchases 
these increases were offset by an aggregate decrease in accounts payable  accrued interest and accrued employment and benefit costs of million and million of cash expenditures incurred in connection with the partnership s restructuring 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was million  reflecting million of partnership distributions and million in debt repayments partially offset by million in apu contributions from the former general partner 
in march  the operating partnership issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an interest rate of 
the senior notes mature june  the senior note agreement requires that the principal be paid in equal annual payments of million starting june  as of september  and through november   the partnership had available a million acquisition facility and a million working capital facility 
borrowings under the bank credit facilities bore interest at a rate based upon either libor plus a margin  first union national bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus of 
an annual fee ranging from 
to 
based upon certain financial tests was payable quarterly whether or not borrowings occurred 
the bank credit facilities  which were due to expire on march   were unsecured on an equal and ratable basis with the operating partnership s obligations under the senior notes 
borrowings under the bank credit facilities were million and as of september  and september   respectively 
the senior note agreement contains and the bank credit facilities contained various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership  including a maintenance of certain financial tests  b restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and c restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
the operating partnership was in compliance with all covenants and terms as of september  in connection with the purchase of assets from scana on november  see note subsequent events  the partnership replaced the bank credit facilities with a new million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by first union national bank as administrative agent 
the revolving credit agreement consists of a million acquisition facility and a million working capital facility which expire on march  the revolving credit agreement provides for substantially the same borrowing terms  interest rates  covenants and conditions as the bank credit facilities 
the revolving credit agreement provides the partnership  at the partnership s option  the right to extend the expiration date from march  to december  provided that the maximum ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda as defined in the revolving credit agreement will decrease from to to to during the nine month extension period 
the partnership borrowed million under the revolving credit agreement s acquisition facility to fund the scana acquisition consisting of million for the scana assets  in acquired working capital and million in related bank fees 
on december   the partnership sold twenty three customer service centers located principally in georgia for million plus working capital 
the partnership has utilized the proceeds of this sale to reduce amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
the partnership will make distributions in an amount equal to all of its available cash approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
the partnership has made distributions of 
per unit to its common unitholders for the first and second fiscal quarters of fiscal and a distribution of 
per unit for the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal consisting of 
in minimum quarterly distribution and an additional distribution of 
per common unit 
the partnership s anticipated cash requirements for fiscal include maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million for the repair and replacement of property  plant and equipment and approximately million of interest payments on the senior notes and the revolving credit agreement 
in addition  the partnership intends to pay approximately million in minimum quarterly distributions and additional distributions to its common unitholders and in distributions to its general partner during fiscal based on its current cash position  availability under the revolving credit agreement and expected cash from operating activities  the partnership expects to have sufficient funds to meet these obligations for fiscal  as well as all of its current obligations and working capital needs during fiscal readiness for year the following disclosure is being made pursuant to the year readiness and disclosure act of many information technology it and non information technology non it systems in use throughout the world today may not be able to properly interpret date related data from the year into the year the yk issue 
as a result  the yk issue could have adverse consequences upon the operations and information processing of many companies  including the partnership 
in the second half of  the partnership began to identify the yk exposure of its it systems by focusing upon those systems and applications it considered critical to its ability to operate its business  supply propane to its customers  and accurately account for those services 
the critical systems identified were the retail sales  the human resources payroll and the general ledger financial accounting systems 
based upon the reasonable assurances of the software developers and vendors  the partnership believes that it has replaced the human resources payroll and the general ledger financial accounting systems with yk compliant versions 
in addition  the partnership has  through the services of a third party vendor  completed the remediation of its retail sales system  as well as the majority of the programs supporting this system 
the partnership has also developed and implemented a comprehensive yk project plan to identify and address both its non critical it and non it systems that could potentially be impacted by yk 
in conjunction with this plan and in an effort to improve its business efficiency  the partnership made the decision to replace all its computer hardware and pc based computer software  as well as to migrate the majority of its network based software to a server environment 
according to the reasonable representations of the manufacturers  software developers and vendors  all of the newly purchased it hardware and pc software are functionally yk compliant 
the partnership has assessed the non it systems utilized by its field locations to determine the yk compliance of those systems 
with limited exceptions which have been addressed  the safety related devices at the partnership s field locations do not incorporate electronic components and  as such  do not require yk remediation 
the partnership does not believe that the failure of any of its non it systems at any field location would have a material adverse impact upon it 
as of december   the partnership has incurred approximately million to address its yk issues 
this figure does not include the amounts spent to upgrade and replace computer hardware and pc based software 
the partnership does not view the foregoing costs as having a material impact upon its overall financial position and has not delayed or eliminated any other scheduled computer upgrades or replacements due to the yk compliance project 
the partnership has completed the testing  as well as any required remediation  of all its critical it systems 
in addition to testing the individual systems  the partnership has conducted an overall it system yk compliance test which was successful 
during the second calendar quarter of  the partnership undertook a business risk impact analysis of its yk exposure 
based upon the results of this analysis  the partnership determined that there was no need for a formal contingency plan due to the availability of manual processes and procedures in response to a yk event 
while propane itself is not date dependent  the supply  transportation and consumption of propane is dependent upon third parties  beyond the control of the partnership  which may have systems potentially impacted by the yk issue 
the partnership has contacted the vendors suppliers identified as being significant to its business and to date has received written responses regarding yk from these parties 
within the group of significant vendors suppliers  firms have been identified as critical to the partnership s business and all have responded in writing to the partnership s requests regarding yk 
the responses received by the partnership typically outline yk compliance programs in effect at these firms and disclose anticipated compliance dates ranging from the first to the fourth calendar quarters of no vendor supplier has  to date  indicated that it will not be yk compliant by the fourth quarter of the partnership has determined that vendors suppliers that have not provided a written response are not critical to its business process and alternate vendors suppliers have been identified 
the partnership believes that by obtaining these responses  it has been able to minimize any potential business interruption arising out of yk s impact upon these vendors suppliers 
further  although the yk failure of any one customer will not have a material adverse effect upon the partnership  if a significant percentage of either its customers and or vendors suppliers fail in achieving yk compliance  the yk issue may have a material adverse impact upon the partnership s operations 
although the partnership currently believes that its internal mission critical it and non it systems are yk compliant  it has taken steps to identify and mitigate yk compliance issues with its vendors suppliers and customers and has adopted a yk contingency plan  the failure of a mission critical it or non it system or the combined failure of vendors suppliers and or customers to achieve yk compliance could have a material adverse impact on the partnership s operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of september   the partnership was party to propane forward and option contracts with various third parties and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
forward and future contracts provide that the partnership sell or acquire propane at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require its holder to buy or sell propane at a specified price during a specified time period  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of propane to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price of propane and the fixed contract price 
the contracts are entered into in anticipation of market movements and to manage and hedge exposure to fluctuating propane prices as well as to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of high demand 
market risks associated with the trading of futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with the partnership s trading policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
market risk the partnership is subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures contracts traded with brokers of the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
credit risk futures contracts are guaranteed by the nymex and as a result have minimal credit risk 
the partnership is subject to credit risk with forward and option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
the partnership evaluates the financial condition of each counterparty with which it conducts business and establishes credit limits to reduce exposure to credit risk of non performance 
sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate the partnership s exposure to unfavorable market price changes in propane related to its open inventory positions  the partnership developed a model which incorporated the following data and assumptions a 
the actual fixed price contract settlement amounts were utilized for each of the future periods 
b 
the estimated future market prices were derived from the new york mercantile exchange for traded propane futures for each of the future periods as of september  c 
the market prices determined in b above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change in the future periods and compared to the fixed contract settlement amounts in a above to project the additional loss in earnings which would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future  forward and or option contract exists indicate potential losses in future earnings of million  as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio 
as of september   the partnership s open position portfolio reflected a net long position purchase aggregating million 
as of november   the posted price of propane at mont belvieu  texas a major storage point was cents per gallon as compared to cents per gallon at september   representing a decline 
such decline is attributable to factors including warmer weather patterns  high national propane inventory levels and decreases in the market price of crude oil
