item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following comments should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in this annual report 
see risks and uncertainties for trends and uncertainties known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
recent developments during  we made significant acquisitions of product rights and licenses 
on december   we acquired exclusive us distribution rights for the patented hospital antibiotic products maxipime registered trademark cefepime hydrochloride for injection and azactam registered trademark aztreonam for injection from bristol myers squibb company 
in august  we acquired from an affiliate of american home products exclusive us marketing rights to the single source tuberculosis drug myambutol registered trademark ethambutol hydochloride 
the acquisitions of rights to these products materially affected our financial position and are expected to materially affect our future operations 
on november   dura and spiros development corporation ii spiros corp 
ii announced the receipt of a complete response letter from the us food and drug administration fda 
the letter indicated that the new drug application nda submitted by dura on behalf of spiros corp 
ii for albuterol spiros trademark will not be approved unless we address certain deficiencies 
albuterol spiros delivers albuterol through our spiros registered trademark system 
the fda requested that we complete additional clinical trials on the spiros system to ensure the system is reliable and to replicate certain clinical outcomes of the initial trials 
the fda also requested that several chemistry  manufacturing  and control issues  as well as certain electromechanical reliability issues  be resolved 
as a result of a series of meetings with the fda  dura and spiros corp 
ii have determined the requirements to address these issues to support the resubmission of the nda for albuterol spiros 
dura  on behalf of spiros corp 
ii  expects to initiate clinical trials for both albuterol spiros and beclomethasone spiros trademark in the fourth quarter of and to commercialize these products in  pending successful development and fda approval 
on september   we announced our agreement with eli lilly and company lilly to develop pulmonary delivery technology for insulin 
the product under development is based on our proprietary spiros system for proteins and peptides 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an up front payment and will receive funding for research as well as additional payments if defined milestones are achieved 
in addition  we will receive royalties and manufacturing payments on products  if any  that reach the market 
lilly has worldwide commercialization rights for any inhaled insulin products that result from the collaboration 
on july   we entered into a series of agreements with a newly formed  privately held company  dj pharma  inc dj pharma  for the co promotion of our keftab registered trademark cephalexin hydrochloride  rondec registered trademark  and certain cough  cold and allergy product lines 
dj pharma also received from us an option to license the exclusive us marketing and distribution rights to these products  which it exercised on october  the marketing and distribution of these products represented dj pharma s sole business activity through december  we provided dj pharma with million in financing in the form of an interest bearing promissory note  which represented dj pharma s sole source of capital until it completed an independent private equity offering in january as dj pharma had not secured financing independent of dura as of december   the accounts of dj pharma have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
the combination of dj pharma into our financial statements reduced net income by million  or per diluted share 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  total revenues in were million  an increase of million  or  over net income for was million  or per diluted share and includes the impact of a nonrecurring charge in the fourth quarter totaling million for the write down of product rights whose values we deemed impaired  as well as the impact of consolidating dj pharma 
excluding these nonrecurring items  we would have reported net income in of million  or per diluted share 
other factors causing these results are discussed below 
pharmaceutical sales in were million  a decrease of million  or  from this decrease is primarily due to a decline in sales of certain of our cough  cold and allergy products resulting from lower prescription volume for such products  partially offset by an increase in sales of myambutol  acquired in august gross profit pharmaceutical sales less cost of sales for was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to this decrease is due to the decrease in pharmaceutical sales discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was for and contract revenue relates primarily to amounts received by us for the development of our spiros system 
pursuant to agreements with several companies  we conduct feasibility testing and development work on various compounds for use with spiros 
contract revenues include payment for feasibility and development work performed by us as well as milestone and technology access payments 
contract revenue for was million  an increase of million  or  over this increase is due to increased development activity conducted on behalf of spiros corp 
ii and lilly 
contract revenue from spiros related development and feasibility agreements for totaled million as compared to million for  including million from spiros corp 
ii for as compared to million from spiros development corporation spiros corp 
and spiros corp 
ii for contract revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on the level of research funding as well as the achievement of milestones and receipt of technology access payments from partners 
clinical  development and regulatory expenses for were million  an increase of million  or  over the increase reflects additional expenses incurred by us under feasibility and development agreements covering the use of various compounds with spiros as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of million  or  over these expenses increased as a percentage of total revenues to for as compared to for the dollar and percentage increases are primarily due to increased costs incurred to support our sales and contract revenue  including costs to expand our sales force from to approximately representatives increase of million  amortization of newly acquired product rights increase of million and increases in operating costs related to general corporate activities increase of million 
in addition  the combination of dj pharma into our financial statements increased our selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
interest income for was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to the increase is due to higher balances of cash and short term investments during resulting primarily from the investment of the net proceeds of our notes offering completed in the third quarter of see liquidity and capital resources below for a more detailed discussion of the notes offering 
interest expense for was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to the same period in the increase is due to interest expense on our notes offering completed in the third quarter of during  we recorded a tax benefit of  on pre tax income of million 
the primary reason for recognizing a tax benefit in spite of achieving pre tax earnings is the availability of federal research and development and other tax credits 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future years will approximate the rate provided for in excluding the impact of nonrecurring charges 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  total revenues in were million  an increase of million  or  over however  we incurred a net loss in of million  or per share basic and diluted  due to nonrecurring charges in the fourth quarter totaling million  of which million related to our spiros system consisting of a million noncash charge for in process technology acquired in connection with our acquisition of spiros corp 
and a million purchase option charge resulting from the cash contribution to spiros corp 
ii 
in december  we terminated a ten year royalty agreement  which we entered into in  resulting in an additional nonrecurring charge of million for the consideration paid by us to terminate the agreement 
finally  in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that the value of a long term investment was impaired and  accordingly  wrote down the investment to its estimated fair value  resulting in a nonrecurring charge of million 
if these nonrecurring charges were excluded  we would have reported net income in of million  or per share basic and per share diluted 
pharmaceutical sales in were million  an increase of million  or  over this increase is due primarily to the acquisition of the entex registered trademark products  ceclor registered trademark cd cefaclor extended release tablets  and keftab registered trademark in and nasarel registered trademark and nasalide registered trademark flunisolide nasal solutions in  which resulted in an increase in pharmaceutical sales of million 
gross profit for was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to gross profit as a percentage of sales for was as compared to for these increases are due primarily to higher average gross margins earned on sales of the entex products  ceclor cd  keftab  nasarel and nasalide  as compared to the average gross margins earned on our other products 
contract revenue for was million  an increase of million  or  over this increase is due to increased development activity conducted on behalf of spiros corp 
and spiros corp 
ii 
contract revenue from spiros related development and feasibility agreements for totaled million as compared to million for  including million from spiros corp 
and spiros corp 
ii for as compared to million from spiros corp 
for clinical  development and regulatory expenses for were million  an increase of million  or  over the increase reflects additional expenses incurred by us under feasibility and development agreements covering the use of various compounds with spiros 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of million  or  over and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to for as compared to for the dollar increase is primarily due to increased costs incurred to support our sales and contract revenue growth  including selling costs to expand our sales force increase of million  higher marketing costs related to the newly acquired products increase of million  and amortization of newly acquired product rights increase of million 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues reflects the growth of pharmaceutical sales due to new product acquisitions and the growth of contract revenues 
interest income for was million  an increase of million as compared to the increase is primarily due to higher balances of cash and short term investments during resulting from public stock offerings completed in may and november and our notes offering completed in the third quarter of  partially offset by decreases in cash used for product acquisitions and capital expenditures 
interest expense for was million as compared to  for the increase is primarily due to interest accrued on our notes issued by us in the third quarter of excluding the impact of nonrecurring charges  our effective tax rate was for as compared to for this increase is primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in net operating loss carryforwards available in relate primarily to tax deductions for stock options exercised 
the related benefit from their utilization has been credited directly to shareholders equity 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from cash used for the purchases of myambutol in august million and maxipime and azactam in december million  cash used to repurchase shares of common stock million  and cash used for capital expenditures million  partially offset by cash generated from operations 
working capital decreased by million from million at december  to million at december in the third quarter of  we issued million principal amount of notes due july  with interest payable semiannually at a coupon rate of 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of common stock at any time prior to maturity or redemption at a conversion price of per share 
in addition to the notes  as of december   we had outstanding an aggregate of million in current and other long term obligations  of which million is to be paid during the next months 
as of december   additional future contingent obligations existed relating to product acquisitions 
payments totaling approximately million  estimated based on historical sales levels of the related products  are contingent upon the levels of future sales of certain products  and approximately million are contingent upon the continued absence of competing formulations of certain products as defined in the respective agreements 
such contingent amounts are payable through  including approximately million contingently due within the next months 
we have entered into a loan agreement which provides for the borrowing of up to million  subject to maintaining certain financial ratios  through may  as of december   no borrowings have been or were outstanding under this agreement 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  cash generated from operations and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to finance our operations through at least the next months 
product or company acquisitions or in licensing opportunities  however  may require significant additional resources 
such additional resources may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
we are actively pursuing the acquisition of rights to products and or companies which may require the use of substantial capital resources  however  there are no present agreements or commitments for such acquisitions 
year we utilize computer systems throughout our business to carry out our day to day operations 
beginning in  we implemented a program designed to enable our computer operating systems to process data having dates on or after january  the program assesses our information technology systems as well as technology systems embedded in our facilities and equipment 
the first phase in our year program was to identify systems with year exposure 
this phase was completed during substantially all the hardware and software comprising our information technology systems were replaced in with systems that are year compliant 
accordingly  no further evaluation or testing of these systems is required 
we are currently evaluating our other systems to assess whether they are year compliant or  if not  whether the systems will be impacted by the change in year 
when the evaluation phase is complete  we will assess if any remediation to these other systems will be necessary 
we have contacted our significant suppliers  customers  and key business partners to determine if our business may be affected if these parties fail to address their year issues 
we intend to monitor the progress made by these parties and to address any risks arising from their failure to adequately prepare for the year in addition  we will test key interfacing data systems with our business partners to ensure that all measures taken to become year compliant are effective 
we are developing a contingency plan to address any year exposures from internal and third party systems that may not be adequately remediated or replaced 
while it is difficult to identify all potential year exposures  the greatest risks to us are our inability to receive and process orders from our customers  and our vendors inability to supply product inventory 
if necessary  our contingency plan will address these risks by identifying alternative suppliers  stocking additional inventory  and developing back up systems to process sales orders 
we expect to complete our year evaluation  testing and contingency planning by june  we estimate that the aggregate costs of our year program will be less than million  including costs incurred to date 
this estimate excludes the cost of the information technology systems implemented in as the implementation was not in response to the year issue 
the majority of the costs are not expected to be incremental expenses but rather an allocation of existing resources 
the estimated impact  cost  and timing of our year program are based on our best estimates using information currently available 
these estimates may not be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from our plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash and short term investments in us government and corporate debt securities with high quality credit ratings and maturities of less than two years 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
at december   we had outstanding subordinated notes totaling million which mature in july the notes have a fixed interest rate of percent 
accordingly  while changes in interest rates may affect the fair market value of the notes  they do not impact our cash flows or results of operations 
as of december   the notes had a fair market value of million 
we are not exposed to risks for changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  or any other market rates
