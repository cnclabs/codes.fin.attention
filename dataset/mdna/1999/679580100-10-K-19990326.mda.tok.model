item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations revenue from operations salaries  wages and benefits purchased transportation operating supplies and expenses depreciation building and office equipment rents operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communication and utilities general supplies and expenses miscellaneous expenses total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income results of operations compared to revenue from operations for increased to  compared to  for this revenue growth was a result of increased market share in existing market areas and the addition of service centers due to expansion into upstate new york in february as well as selected asset purchases of two trucking companies during the year 
during the first quarter of  the company opened four service centers in albany  buffalo  rochester and syracuse  new york 
nine additional service centers were opened during the year as a result of the acquisition of selected assets of fredrickson motor express corporation in january and goggin truck line company  inc in august average less than truckload ltl revenue per shipment decreased 
to for the current year from for this decrease was due to a 
reduction in revenue per hundredweight 
the reduction in revenue per hundredweight was a direct result of a decrease in the company s average length of haul to miles from miles 
the decrease in average length of haul was caused by growth in the company s short haul revenue that resulted from the acquisition of fredrickson and goggin assets  both of which operated in the southeastern region of the country 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company s regional revenue increased during the year compared to the previous year  versus an inter regional revenue growth of 
overall inter regional revenue accounted for of revenue from operations compared to for regional revenue 
operating expenses as a percent of revenue  the operating ratio  increased slightly to for the current year compared to for the previous year 
the increased operating ratio was primarily a result of an increase in salaries  wages and benefits  depreciation and general supplies and expenses 
combined  these expenses were operating points higher than the previous year  increasing to of revenue from for the previous year 
these increased costs as a percent of revenue were offset by decreases in purchased transportation and operating supplies and expenses 
combined  these costs decreased to of revenue for the current year from for  a operating point decrease 
salaries  wages and benefits increased to of revenue in from in the expansion of the service center network in allowed the company to deliver more shipments directly with company personnel and equipment  which increased wages and depreciation expense  while decreasing outside purchased transportation 
the planned reduction of purchased transportation  which has been a trend over the last three years  allows the company to provide superior service with less handling and overall delivery costs 
accordingly  purchased transportation decreased to of revenue from for the previous year 
in addition  sales personnel were added to service the expanded customer base and to increase market share in existing markets 
depreciation increased to of revenue in the current year compared to for the previous year 
this increase was due primarily to increased capital expenditures for the expansion of existing service centers  purchases of new service centers which were previously leased  investments and upgrades to the company s information systems and the acquisition of selected assets of fredrickson and goggin 
the conversion to ownership of formerly leased facilities resulted in a reduction of building and office equipment rents to of revenue in from for the previous year 
operating supplies and expenses decreased to of revenue in from for the previous year 
this reduction was primarily due to a reduction in the average price per gallon paid for fuel during compared to the company s tariffs  however  contain provisions that allow a fuel surcharge to be assessed should the price per gallon of fuel exceed certain limits 
during  the company exercised these provisions which were reflected as an increase in revenue in on a comparable basis  the cost of fuel  net of the fuel surcharge  was in compared to in net income was  for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to  for the effective tax rate was approximately in both and compared to revenue from operations for was  an increase of  compared to  for this revenue growth was a direct result of the company s focus on improving both revenue per hundredweight  or revenue yield  and market share in existing areas of operations  or market density 
ltl tonnage increased during the year and total tonnage increased 
these tonnage increases reflect increased market share in existing areas of operation  as well as the impact of opening five new service centers in and six new service centers in  which primarily expanded and enhanced direct service in existing regions of operations 
average ltl revenue per shipment increased to in compared to for this increase was a result of a increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight to in from for the previous year 
the improvement in ltl revenue per hundredweight reflects a general rate increase on public tariffs implemented on january   as well as increases on private tariffs that were negotiated throughout the year 
the average weight per ltl shipment was  lbs 
for both and  and thus had no impact on the increase in average ltl revenue per shipment from to operating expense as a percentage of revenue  or the operating ratio  was for compared to for the prior year 
this improvement resulted primarily from decreases in purchased transportation and operating supplies and expenses  which combined  were operating points lower in than in purchased transportation decreased to of revenue from in the prior year as a result of the company s continuing effort to replace cartage agents with company personnel and equipment 
operating supplies and expenses decreased to of revenue from in due to a reduction in vehicle repair and maintenance costs to of revenue from for the previous year  a 
reduction in the average price per gallon of fuel in  and improved fleet fuel efficiency to miles per gallon in from for the previous year 
the reduced repair and maintenance costs resulted  in part  from a reduction in the average age of the linehaul tractor fleet to years in from years for the previous year and a comparatively milder winter season in building and office equipment rents decreased to of revenue in compared to in as a result of the company s purchase of seven service center facilities 
insurance and claims decreased to from in the previous year 
this decrease is primarily attributed to a reduction in cargo claims expense to of revenue from for this reduction reflects an ongoing company wide focus on continuous improvement in freight handling processes and equipment 
depreciation decreased to of revenue from in and operating taxes and licenses decreased to from in as a result of the company leveraging higher revenue against these relatively fixed operating costs in these reductions in expenses were somewhat offset by an increase in salaries  wages and benefits to of revenue from for in  the company continued to replace cartage agents used for pickup and delivery services in remote areas with company personnel and equipment  which primarily led to the increase in salaries  wages and benefits 
as part of the overall strategy to increase density and market share in existing markets  the company added new field sales personnel in  an increase of over the prior year 
in addition  the company added five new service centers in that expanded direct coverage in regions already served 
linehaul and pickup and delivery wages were higher in the expanded areas as the company provided superior service while building service center and lane density 
the company s net interest expense increased slightly as a percent of revenue to in from in  due to an increase in average outstanding debt 
net income was  for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to  for the effective tax rate was approximately in both and liquidity and capital resources expansion in both the size and number of service center facilities  the planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and revenue growth have required continued investment in property and equipment 
in order to support these requirements  the company incurred net capital expenditures of  during the year ended december  cash flows generated internally were sufficient to fund of the required capital expenditures during the year 
the remaining capital needs were achieved through additional debt  including borrowings on the company s line of credit  of which  was outstanding at year end december   compared to  at year end at december   long term debt including current maturities increased to  from  at december  the company estimates capital expenditures to be approximately  to  for the year ending december  of that  approximately  will be used for purchases of larger replacement service centers or expansion of existing service centers  approximately  will be used to purchase revenue equipment and the remaining balance will be used for investments in technology and other assets 
the company plans to fund these expenditures through cash flows from operations supplemented by additional borrowings 
the company maintains a  uncollateralized credit facility that consists of a  line of credit commitment and a  letter of credit commitment 
interest on the line of credit is charged at rates that vary based upon a certain financial performance ratio and the stated period of time that the borrowings are outstanding 
the applicable interest rate for was based upon libor plus 
for periods of days and prime minus for periods less than days 
a fee of 
is charged on the unused portion of the  line of credit and letter of credit facility  and a fee of 
is charged on outstanding letters of credit 
at december   there were  outstanding borrowings on the line of credit and  outstanding on the letter of credit facility  which is required for self insured retention reserves for bodily injury  property damage and workers compensation insurance 
the company believes that it has sufficient credit lines and capacity to meet seasonal and long term financial needs 
on february   the company entered into a  private placement of debt through a note purchase agreement 
this agreement consists of  of senior notes maturing in bearing a fixed interest rate of and  of senior notes maturing in bearing a fixed interest rate of 
the proceeds from this private debt agreement were used to replace the outstanding borrowings on the line of credit facility with long term  fixed rate obligations and were also used to finance capital expenditures for service center facilities and revenue equipment 
the company has minimal exposure to changes in interest rates from its long term debt arrangements as approximately of that debt has fixed interest rates 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
also  the company  currently  is not using any fuel hedging instruments as its tariff provisions generally allow for fuel surcharges to be implemented in the event that fuel prices exceed stipulated levels 
impact of the year some of the company s internally generated software  third party software  information technology it systems and non it systems were written or designed using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  that software or system is likely to interpret a date using as the year rather than the year this could possibly cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment of its software to ensure that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
as of this filing date  the company has successfully completed modifications to all internally generated software and is currently utilizing the modified software in production 
the total cost to complete this phase of the year project was approximately  all third party software requiring modification has been identified and those modifications have been successfully completed  tested and placed into production 
each software vendor performed the necessary modifications to the third party software for year compliance and the costs were included in the annual maintenance fees charged to the company 
actual costs to the company were minimal 
during  the company successfully completed modifications to its it hardware for year compliance at a cost of approximately  most of this expense was for the replacement of all the company s older model personal computers 
while this hardware was tested to the extent possible and is currently being used in production  failure of one or large groups of these personal computers would not have a critical impact on the company 
old dominion is approximately complete in its evaluation of non it systems  such as telephone switches and security systems  to identify systems that require modification 
as each system or component is identified  a plan to make appropriate modifications is initiated 
the company believes there is minimal risk in this area and the cost of these modifications or upgrades  if any  is expected to be less than  these evaluations and subsequent modifications to non it hardware should be finalized by june  the company is currently complete in its evaluation phase of its major customers and suppliers to determine if they have taken adequate measures to ensure that necessary modifications are made to their software and hardware prior to the year the completion of the supplier evaluation phase  which is scheduled for july   will determine the actions the company will take in securing alternate suppliers by year end the company is actively assisting customers in achieving year compliance in their electronic data interchange applications that are used to communicate with the company in their normal course of business 
if these systems fail  the company plans to convert to traditional methods of communication such mail  phone and fax  which it currently uses with the majority of its customer base 
in addition  the company s existing systems could be used to provide customers with freight tracing and documentation requirements if their systems fail 
the process of monitoring customers and suppliers for year compliance may well extend until  as those companies execute their year plans 
the company s largest customer in accounted for of revenue  therefore  the company is not dependent on any one customer 
critical supplies such as fuel and parts are generally available from multiple sources and the company s physical locations are not dependent on one provider of utilities 
however  failure by any large groups of suppliers or customers to make necessary year modifications could result in a material adverse impact on the company 
the company has incurred approximately  to date in monitoring customer and supplier compliance and expects to incur an additional  by year end in order to avoid problems that could arise in the year  all modifications to internally generated software were simulated in a year test environment and subjected to comprehensive quality standards prior to being placed into production 
similar it hardware testing  to the extent possible  has been performed 
the company s contingency plan  in the event hardware or software failures occur in early  is to have its internal it staff and external it support resources available to address these potential problems as they are identified 
the company believes today that the most likely worst case scenario would involve malfunctions in computer software at the corporate headquarters  temporary disruptions in the delivery of services and products to the company  primarily communications  utilities and fuel  and temporary disruptions in payments from customers 
the company expects that these events would result in increased expense and lost revenue  and would adversely affect the company s cash flow 
the total cost incurred to date for year compliance is approximately  and the company expects to incur an additional  by year end the cost of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  the ability of the company s customers and suppliers to address their year compliance problems and similar uncertainties 
inflation most of the company s expenses are affected by inflation  which will generally result in increased costs 
for the year ending  the effect of inflation on the company s results of operations was minimal 
seasonality the company s operations are subject to seasonal trends common in the motor carrier industry 
operating results in the first and fourth quarters are normally lower due to reduced shipments during the winter months 
harsh winter weather can also adversely impact the company s performance by reducing demand and increasing operating expenses 
the second and third quarters are stronger due to increased demand for services during the spring and summer months 
environmental the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  particularly relative to underground storage tanks ust s 
the company believes it is in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to ust s  and does not believe that the cost of future compliance will have a material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition
