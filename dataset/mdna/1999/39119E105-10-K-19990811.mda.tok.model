great plains made significant investments in research and development in the early s to launch dynamics and eenterprise 
in addition  we have made a significant investment in building an experienced and knowledgeable network of independent channel partners to market  implement and support our dynamics and eenterprise products together  the great plains platform products 
since the release of the great plains platform products  our principal source of revenues has shifted from the heritage product to great plains platform products 
great plains platform products accounted for  and of our total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
great plains revenues are derived from two principal sources software license fees and fees for maintenance  technical support  training and consulting services 
as required  great plains recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  which we adopted beginning june  statement of position generally requires revenue earned on software products  upgrades or enhancements  rights to exchange or return software  post contract customer support  or services  including elements deliverable only on a when and if available basis  to be allocated to the various elements of such sale based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair market values 
if this evidence does not exist  revenue from the sale would be deferred until sufficient evidence exists  or until all elements have satisfied the requirements for revenue recognition 
prior to adoption of statement of position  great plains recognized revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
this adoption did not have a material effect on the timing of great plains revenue recognition or cause changes to our revenue recognition policies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
license fee revenues are generally recognized upon shipment of the related software product and associated registration keys 
fees for great plains maintenance and support plans are recorded as deferred revenue when billed to the customer and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support agreement  which is typically one year 
fees for great plains training and consulting services are recognized at the time the services are performed 
great plains eenterprise and dynamics customers are required to purchase a one year maintenance plan at the time the product is acquired 
a majority of these customers renew the maintenance plan after the initial term 
under the maintenance plan  great plains provides these customers with product upgrades in addition to on line assistance and information 
the maintenance program for great plains heritage product provides customers with product updates  which are less significant releases of the heritage product  however  heritage product upgrades are not included in the heritage maintenance program 
heritage customers can purchase product upgrades as they are released

results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in great plains consolidated statement of income 
year ended may  as a percentage of total revenues revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income revenues revenues 
revenues increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing increases of and  respectively 
these increases in revenues were primarily due to increased demand for great plains platform products and related services 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated great plains platform and heritage product revenues  each as a percentage of total revenues year ended may  great plains platform product revenues heritage product revenues great plains platform product revenues  including license and service fees  increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing increases of and  respectively 
the increase in great plains platform product revenues was offset  in part  by a decrease in revenues from great plains heritage product 
heritage product revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal representing decreases of and  respectively 
the decrease in heritage product revenues was primarily due to a decrease in demand for dos and macintosh solutions  which reflects the broader market trend toward windows and windows nt solutions 
also  the decrease in heritage product revenue can be attributed to the expected decline in the number of customers purchasing great plains accounting version heritage upgrade  which was initially released in february great plains anticipates that heritage product revenues will continue to decrease in future periods 
great plains international revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing   and of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
these increases were the result of growth in existing markets as well as the addition of distribution in new markets through new subsidiaries and new international distribution partners 
in fiscal  the revenue growth was largely a result of growth in markets served by our existing subsidiary operations and the fact that all of our subsidiaries were in operation for the entire year 
in fiscal  the growth was primarily a result of growth in our international subsidiary operations in the united kingdom and australia  as well as from the addition of new subsidiary operations in singapore  south africa and scandinavia 
license 
total license fee revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing increases of and  respectively 
these increases in total license fee revenues are largely attributable to increased market demand for our great plains platform products 
in addition  we broadened our great plains platform solutions in fiscal with the addition of human resources  manufacturing and enterprise reporting solutions 
the release of these new solutions contributed to the increase in license fee revenue for fiscal the increase in great plains platform product license fee revenues was offset  in part  by a decrease in heritage product license fee revenues 
the decrease in heritage product license fees is primarily a result of decreased sales of upgrades to existing heritage customers 
the most recent significant upgrade of the heritage product  great plains accounting version  was released in february which was marketed principally to our installed base of heritage product customers 
therefore  the decline in revenue from the heritage products of and in and respectively  was expected as we generally experience the majority of upgrade sales in the quarters following a new release 
great plains continues to expect that overall heritage product license fee revenues will continue to decline 
service 
service revenues increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing increases of and  respectively 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in service revenues is due largely to the increased number of licenses for great plains platform products and renewals of existing maintenance and support contracts from the increased installed base of great plains platform customers 
costs and expenses cost of license fees 
cost of license fees consists primarily of the costs of product manuals  media  shipping and royalties paid to third parties 
cost of license fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing  and of total license fee revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in cost of license fees for fiscal and fiscal are primarily attributable to an overall growth in license fee revenues and an increase in the sale of products for which great plains is obligated to pay royalties to third party vendors 
the increase in cost of license fees as a percentage of license revenue increased in fiscal and fiscal due to a higher mix of revenue from sales of third party products for which we have a royalty obligation 
the cost of license fees as a percentage of license fee revenues may continue to increase if great plains enters into additional royalty arrangements or if the sale of products which include a royalty obligation increase as a percentage of total license fee revenues 
cost of services 
cost of services consists of the costs of providing telephone support  training and consulting services to customers and partners 
cost of services increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cost of services is primarily due to the expansion of great plains service resources 
cost of services as a percentage of service revenues decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal and for fiscal these decreases are due  in part  to improved efficiency in operations and continued strong customer enrollment in maintenance plans and support contracts 
we anticipate that cost of services will increase in dollar amount as service revenues increase and may increase as a percentage of service revenue if additional resources are added to support new initiatives 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing   and of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal reflects an increase in sales and marketing productivity and a corresponding increase in revenues derived from our great plains platform products 
the dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal and fiscal is attributable to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  continued investments in expanding the capacity and capability of the channel for our platform products  increased marketing expenses for our great plains platform products including  a global advertising and brand awareness campaign  and increased commission expenses associated with higher revenues 
in addition  great plains increased sales and marketing expenses related to the operation of our international subsidiaries in canada  the united kingdom  scandinavia  south africa  singapore and australia 
great plains anticipates that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount as total revenues increase  however  great plains does not anticipate significant changes in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation of development personnel and depreciation of equipment 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing  and of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the increase in research and development both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues was  in part  due to additional resources added to further develop the new solution areas of e business  human resources  manufacturing and enterprise reporting  as well as from resources added as a result of the fourth quarter acquisition of match data systems  which included an established development center in manila  philippines 
in fiscal  the dollar increase for research and development was from development efforts primarily focused on the delivery of substantial new versions of great plains platform products and the release of an electronic commerce solution 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal due to efficiencies gained through greater experience levels among development personnel  greater automation in our development testing process and an increased focus on microsoft technologies 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development effort and that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount in future periods and may increase as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of executive  financial  human resources and information services personnel  as well as outside professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing  and of total revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
these increases in dollar amount were primarily due to increased staffing and related expenses necessary to manage and support the expansion of our operations 
in addition  dollar increases in fiscal were due  in part  to expenses related to being a publicly held company 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount in the future to support the expansion of our operations 
acquired in process research and development 
great plains completed two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal  both of which were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the first acquisition provided a human resources application and manufacturing solution  while the second acquisition provided a multinational enterprise reporting solution 
the purchase price for these acquisitions was million for the manufacturing and human resource applications and million for the enterprise reporting solution 
valuation of the intangible assets acquired were determined by an independent third party appraisal company and consisted of in process research and development  current technology  assembled workforce  and goodwill 
the amounts related to in process research and development  as determined by the independent third party appraisal company that was charged against income in fiscal  as the underlying research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses included million for manufacturing  million for human resources  and million for enterprise reporting 
great plains has used the acquired in process research and development to complete new products in the areas of human resources  manufacturing  and enterprise reporting  which will become part of our product lines over the next several years 
we released the initial products developed from the acquired in process research and development in fiscal we expect additional significant releases will continue through fiscal the nature of the efforts required to complete development of the acquired in process research and development into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet design specifications  including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
the estimated costs at the time of acquisition to be incurred to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products were million for the manufacturing solution  million for human resources  and million for enterprise reporting 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by an independent third party appraiser  which projected cash flows related to future products expected to be derived once technological feasibility was achieved  including costs to complete the development of technology and the future revenues and costs which are expected to result from commercialization of the products 
cash flows recognized the contribution of core technology and other supporting assets and were discounted back to their present value at a rate of 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on estimates made by great plains management of revenues  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs  and income taxes resulting from such projects 
these management estimates were based on expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of completion of acquired in process research and development 
nothing has come to management s attention that would lead management to believe substantial changes need to be made to the underlying assumptions 
great plains did not have any write off of acquired in process research and development in fiscal or fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income  net 
other income  net  consists primarily of earnings from investments and gains or losses from disposal of fixed assets  net of any interest expense 
other income  net increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in other income  net in fiscal was primarily a result of increased investment earnings due to increased investments as a result of the more than million received from great plains public offering of common stock in march  as well as additional cash resulting from our increased operating income 
the increase in other income  net in fiscal was primarily a result of increased investment earnings due to increased investments as a result of the more than million received from great plains initial public offering of common stock in june  as well as additional cash resulting from our increased operating income 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal and  the provision for income taxes was and  respectively  of income before income taxes  which represents an increase from the fiscal annual effective income tax rate of

such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of great plains common stock 
great plains establishes its expenditure levels based on its expectations as to future revenue  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
as a result  a drop in near term demand for great plains products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
in the future  great plains operating results may fluctuate for this reason or as a result of a number of other factors  including increased expenses  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of sales  announcements of new products by great plains or our competitors  and capital spending patterns of great plains customers 
great plains business has experienced and may continue to experience seasonality 
in recent years  due to a number of factors  including the timing of product releases and sales incentive programs  great plains has recognized a greater percentage of our revenue and operating income in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any of the first three quarters 
moreover  due to fiscal year end sales incentive programs  great plains has historically recognized less revenue and operating income in our first fiscal quarter than in the other quarters 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that great plains will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
liquidity and capital resources great plains has historically funded operations primarily through cash provided by operations and the sale of equity securities 
currently  great plains meets its working capital needs and capital equipment needs with cash provided by operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal was primarily due to revenue growth and increased profits from great plains operations as well as increases in deferred revenues of million  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million offset by a million reduction in income taxes payable and a million increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in cash provided by operations for fiscal was due primarily to cash provided by the following improved profitability of great plains operations  the million non cash charge for acquired in process research and development  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  an increase in deferred revenues of million and an increase in income taxes payable of million 
cash generated from operations was offset primarily by a million increase in deferred tax assets and a million increase in accounts receivable 
great plains investing activities used cash of million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in investing activities for fiscal and was approximately million and approximately million for the purchase of investments following great plains second public offering and initial public offering of common stock  respectively 
investing activities in fiscal also included cash used of approximately million for the purchase of property and equipment to support our growth as well as the need to furnish the new building that we will be moving into late in the first quarter of fiscal investing activities in fiscal also included cash used of approximately million for two acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  investing activities for fiscal included increased capital expenditures related to the acquisition of computer equipment and furniture required to support expansion of our operations 
investing activities in fiscal primarily consisted of increased capital expenditures related to the acquisition of computer equipment and furniture required to support expansion of our operations as well as the purchase of investments 
great plains financing activities provided cash of million  million  and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
for fiscal  cash of million was provided from financing activities primarily from million from the sale of great plains common stock in a public offering in march and proceeds received from stock options that were exercised during the year 
for fiscal  cash of million was provided from financing activities primarily from million from the sale of great plains common stock in an initial public offering and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
for fiscal  cash of million was provided from financing activities which consisted primarily of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options offset in part by payments on capital lease obligations and notes payable 
great plains sources of liquidity at may   consisted principally of cash  cash equivalents and investments of million 
great plains also has a million revolving line of credit facility with a bank 
the line of credit expires november  and borrowings made thereunder are subject to certain covenants 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at may  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
great plains believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  cash generated from operations and the amounts available under the line of credit will be sufficient to fund its operations for the foreseeable future 
year many currently installed computer systems and software are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code fields 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
this problem could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of business operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in other similar business activities 
as a result  many companies computer systems and software will need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with year requirements 
the potential global impact of the year problem is not known 
if year problems are not corrected in a timely manner  they could affect great plains  and the us and world economy generally 
all of great plains current products are year compliant 
great plains platform products have been year compliant since their initial introduction  as are versions and of the heritage product 
great plains is currently offering our heritage product customers a free year compliant upgrade for prior versions of the heritage product 
even though great plains current products are year compliant  there can be no assurance that midmarket businesses will have sufficient resources available for the acquisition of new systems from us because they may be diverting resources to fix internal systems that are not year compliant 
great plains has formed a project team consisting of representatives from our information technology  finance  manufacturing  product development  sales  marketing and legal departments to address other internal and external year issues 
our internal financial  manufacturing and other computer systems are being reviewed to assess and remediate year problems 
our assessment of internal systems includes our information technology as well as other systems that contain embedded technology in manufacturing or process control equipment containing microprocessors or other similar circuitry 
our year compliance program includes the following phases identifying systems that need to be modified or replaced  carrying out remediation work to modify existing systems or convert to new systems  and conducting validation testing of systems and applications to ensure compliance 
great plains is currently completing the second phase of this program 
the amount of remediation work required to address year problems is not expected to be extensive 
we have replaced certain financial and operational systems in the last several years  and management believes that the new equipment and software substantially addresses year issues 
however  we will be required to modify some of our existing hardware and software for our computer systems to function properly in the year and thereafter 
we have substantially completed our year compliance program for all of our significant internal systems as of may  in addition  great plains has received assurances from our major suppliers that they are addressing the year issue  and that products purchased by us from such suppliers will function properly in the year however  it is impossible to fully assess the potential consequences in the event service interruptions from suppliers occur or in the event that there are disruptions in such infrastructure areas as utilities  communications  transportation  banking and government 
the total estimated cost for resolving great plains year issues is approximately  of which approximately  has been spent through may  the total cost estimate includes the cost of replacing non compliant systems as a remediation cost in cases where we have accelerated plans to replace such systems 
estimates of year costs are based on numerous assumptions  and there can be no assurance that the estimates are correct or that actual costs will not be materially greater than anticipated 
based on assessments to date  great plains believes it will not experience any material disruption as a result of year problems in internal manufacturing processes  information processing or interface with major customers  or with processing orders and billing 
however  if certain critical third party providers  such as those providers supplying electricity  water or telephone service  experience difficulties resulting in disruption of service to great plains  a shutdown of great plains operations at individual facilities could occur for the duration of the disruption 
great plains has developed a contingency plan to provide for continuity of processing in the event of various problem scenarios 
assuming no major disruption in service from utility companies or other critical third party providers  we believe that we will be able to manage our total year transition without any material effect on our results of operations or financial condition
