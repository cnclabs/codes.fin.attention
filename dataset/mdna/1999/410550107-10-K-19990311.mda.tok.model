the company is continuing to test a home shopping service in the boston  massachusetts market called hannaford s homeruns r 
the majority of its customer orders are generated from an internet based  virtual shopping experience 
this service generated a net loss of approximately per share in  in and 
per share in management will continue to test this business venture in year issues year yk issues arise from the inability of some computer based systems to properly recognize and process dates after december  the company is dependent on computer hardware  software  systems and processes it systems and non information technology systems  such as telephones  clocks  scales  refrigeration controllers and other equipment containing embedded microprocessor technology facilities systems 
most of the company s key business processes  such as product procurement  warehousing  product delivery  inventory and labor management  retail sales and financial information reporting  depend on these systems 
in  the company initiated a readiness plan to address yk issues 
the readiness plan addresses two major segments it systems including mainframe  pc desktop and in store systems  and facilities systems including all retail stores  distribution centers  corporate offices and other owned real estate 
phases of the readiness plan common to each segment include data collection  assessment and prioritization  resolution  testing and implementation  and monitoring ongoing compliance 
the company currently expects to complete all phases of its readiness plan as follows it systems mainframe completed network march pc desktop august in store august facilities systems june more than of the company s it systems utilize a standard calendar routine 
this routine has been reprogrammed to be yk compliant 
in addition  the company is extending this calendar routine to nearly all it systems where it was not previously used 
this standardization has simplified the company s remediation efforts and has reduced the cost of the readiness plan 
as a final step  the company will test systems deemed critical by running them in a fully integrated yk environment 
critical systems include  but are not limited to  product procurement systems for supermarkets and warehouses  in store retail sales systems and centralized financial systems including payroll and banking activities 
the company has used outside consultants to help with various phases of the readiness plan 
however  the company is relying on its own associates to verify all test results prior to implementation 
the readiness plan for all it systems is progressing on schedule 
the company s mainframe applications have been remediated and tested in a yk environment 
in addition  all mainframe systems software has been tested with an actual calendar rollover from to the company has completed all mainframe yk work and will continue to monitor ongoing compliance 
facilities systems work has been completed at all retail stores and corporate offices 
the yk readiness plan for distribution centers and other owned real estate is currently scheduled to be completed by june in addition to the readiness plan addressing it and facilities systems  the company contacted critical business partners product suppliers  service providers  and those with which the company exchanges information in january  requesting information regarding the status of their individual yk compliance plans 
this effort will also consist of analyzing specific partners responses and personally contacting those deemed most critical  for verification of their status 
the company currently expects that all critical business partners will have been contacted and yk readiness verified by june based on current information  management expects that the company will not experience significant disruption in operations as a result of yk issues 
management believes it has identified the principal hardware and software modifications that must be made in order to address the most significant yk issues 
the company is currently in the process of establishing a contingency plan to address mission critical processes in the event of a yk caused failure 
management will establish the plan based on actual testing experience and assessment of outside risks 
the company currently anticipates that it will have a fully developed contingency plan by june this plan will be reviewed and updated throughout the balance of because the company s yk compliance is partially dependent upon key business partners also being yk compliant on a timely basis  there can be no guarantee that the company s overall efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the possible consequences to the company of not being fully yk compliant include temporary supermarket closings  delays in the delivery of merchandise  errors in purchase orders and other financial transactions and the inability to efficiently process customer purchases 
in addition  business disruptions could result from the loss of power or the loss of communication links between supermarkets  warehouses and headquarters locations 
however  management believes that the company s store base is broad enough to minimize the impact of isolated disruptions 
the total cost associated with anticipated yk modifications is not material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the total estimated cost of the readiness plan  including the cost of internal resources  is approximately to million  of which approximately million has been incurred through the end of most of the company s additional budgeted yk expenditures are earmarked for completion of facilities systems testing  pc desktop remediation  and for continuing interaction with business partners 
these costs do not include amounts capitalized in the normal course of business to replace or upgrade older  outdated systems whose replacement was not accelerated due to yk issues 
all costs are being funded by operating cash flows  and the costs of the readiness plan are being expensed as incurred 
management does not anticipate deferring any technology related projects due to these costs or the implementation of its readiness plan 
the cost of the conversions and the projected completion dates are based on management s current best estimates and are subject to revision as additional information becomes available 
other items and impact of inflation seasonal business affects the company s operations in that sales are generally greater in the second half of the year note 
in recent years  the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been minimal  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy 
the company s business is characterized by large purchases and high sales volumes extended across diverse product lines  rapid inventory turns and low profit margins 
in this environment  vendor price changes are typically passed on to the customer 
the company does not believe inflation or deflation has significantly affected its competitive position in the industry 
however  since price changes do cause sales dollars to fluctuate  the use of the lifo method of accounting for inventories reduces the impact of price changes on earnings by matching current costs with current revenues 
capital resources and liquidity overview measures of liquidity at the end of the last three fiscal years were as follows dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents working capital fifo inventory unused lines of revolving credit unused lines of short term credit current ratio fifo inventory the company continued to maintain a strong capital position at the end of fiscal cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at the end of the year

cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in  a slight decrease from the million provided in this decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in inventories  receivables and prepayments  partially offset by an increase in deferred taxes 
the fluctuations within these accounts are part of the company s normal business operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  a decrease of million from the million provided in this decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction in cash flows provided by net working capital items partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization 
the impairment loss was a non cash charge 
although it impacted certain components of cash flows from operating activities  it had no net impact on cash provided by operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased million during to million from million in this decrease is the result of the company s reduced capital investment coupled with the increased net book value of assets sold during the year 
during  the company completed the sale of certain assets relating to supermarkets that were closed in january and written down to their estimated fair values in capital investments totaled million in and were composed of million in additions to property  plant and equipment  million in computer software costs and deferred charges and million in non cash capital lease additions

by the end of  approximately two thirds of the company s supermarkets will have been newly constructed  expanded or remodeled within the last five years 
cash used in investing activities decreased million during to million from million in this decrease is primarily the result of the company s reduced capital investment in following the construction of a new distribution facility in the southeast in capital investments totaled million in and were composed of million in additions to property  plant and equipment  million in deferred charges and computer software costs and million in non cash capital lease additions 
cash flows from financing activities cash used in financing activities was million in  as compared to million in this reduction in cash flows of million is primarily the result of increased payments of long term debt coupled with reduced proceeds from the issuance of long term debt

forward looking statements from time to time  information provided by the company or statements made by its associates may contain forward looking information  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of examples of such statements in this report include those concerning the year issue  the company s expected future tax rates  construction schedules and capital expenditures 
the company cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors and risks including  but not limited to  the following hannaford s future operating results are dependent on its ability to achieve increased sales and to control expenses 
factors such as lower than expected inflation  product cost fluctuations particularly in perishable categories  changes in product mix or the use of promotional items  both of which may affect pricing strategy  continued or increased competitive pressures from existing competitors and new entrants  including price cutting strategies  and deterioration in general or regional economic conditions are all factors which could adversely affect sales projections 
other components of operating results could be adversely affected by state or federal legislation or regulation that increases costs  interest rates or the company s cost of borrowing  by increases in labor rates due to low unemployment or other factors  by unanticipated costs related to the opening and closing of stores or by the inability to control various expense categories 
hannaford s future growth is dependent on its ability to expand its retail square footage  either de novo or through acquisitions 
increases in interest rates or the company s cost of capital  the unavailability of funds for capital expenditures and the inability to develop new stores or convert existing stores as rapidly as planned are all risks to projected future expansion 
adverse determinations with respect to pending or future litigation or other material claims against hannaford could affect actual results 
furthermore  the market price of hannaford common stock could be subject to fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in analysts earnings estimates  market conditions in the retail sector  especially in the supermarket industry  as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to hannaford
