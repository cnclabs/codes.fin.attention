item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition general the modest growth in sales from to is primarily the result of the company increasing its production capacity to meet the unit expansion of the electronic components industry and the inclusion of approximately million of net sales in as a result of the acquisition of tpc  effective june this expansion has been due primarily to the growth of computer  telecommunications and automotive manufacturers usage of passive electronic components  as the use of electronics in all walks of life has become more widespread and sophisticated 
during this period of unit growth in the industry  the average selling prices of electronic components  as well as the selling prices of end use products which rely on passive components  have declined 
in order to lower the costs of production  the company continues to increase automation of its manufacturing processes  substitute base metals for precious metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors and transfer certain labor intensive manufacturing processes from countries with higher labor costs to lower labor cost areas such as the czech republic  el salvador  malaysia and mexico 
the company also places emphasis on the development of specialty advanced and connector products in order to take advantage of higher margin sales growth 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationships to net sales of certain income statement items for the periods presented 
year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses profit from operations income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income outlook precious metal costs coupled with selling price pressures continue to create difficult market conditions  although the company has recently experienced strengthened demand and firmer selling prices 
the company believes that there are several factors which may lead to improved profitability during the next year  including a the expanding use of electronics and the resulting increased demand for passive components and interconnect products  b the company s ongoing efforts to substitute base metals for precious metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors  c continued improvements in production processes  d the growth of advanced products through innovation and component design in conjunction with our customers  and e expanded product offerings resulting from the tpc acquisition 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the year ended march  decreased to  million from  million for the year ended march  sales for the year ended march  include approximately million of sales from tpc  a passive component manufacturing business acquired on june  exclusive of the acquisition of tpc  sales declined  although global unit sales increased year over year 
the decrease in revenue was attributable to a combination of factors  including  the negative impact of the asian economic crisis on worldwide demand and prices  a softening of demand in the electronic components industry as customers reduced their level of inventory and suppliers reduced their lead times  and the continued trend toward smaller part sizes  all of which contributed to lower average selling prices 
partially offsetting these overall effects was a increase in sales of advanced products within the passive components group and an increase in sales of connector products 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended march  decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the year ended march  as indicated above  overall sales prices in fiscal were lower compared to fiscal gross profit was also negatively impacted by the rising cost of palladium  a precious metal used in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors 
compared to fiscal  the average market price for palladium during fiscal increased to per troy ounce 
the overall impact of rising palladium prices is estimated to have reduced gross profit for fiscal by million 
slightly lower throughput  which negatively impacts cost absorption  reflects soft demand and the intentional reduction in the company s inventory levels  also contributed to the decline in gross profit 
partially offsetting these factors were continued production efficiencies and improvements in production processes  as well as the impact of relatively higher sales of better margin advanced and connector products 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by costs associated with the integration of the recently acquired tpc operation into the company s organization 

the benefit of cost cutting measures and organizational changes initiated since the tpc acquisition is expected to be realized during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million of net sales  compared with million of net sales in the year ended march  the increase is primarily attributable to the integration of the tpc operations and the amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition 
research  development and engineering expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products  processes and technical innovations  were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these cost are incurred as the company continues to enhance existing product lines and develop new products 
as a result of the above factors  profit from operations for the year ended march   decreased to million from million for the year ended march  for the reasons set forth above and lower interest income on invested cash  net income in the year ended march  decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the year ended march year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the year ended march  increased to  million from  million for the year ended march  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth in the ceramic and tantalum products  particularly surface mount and advanced products 
despite the overall increase in sales  the company s results continue to be impacted by several factors including a the shortening of lead times as customers reduced their level of inventory and suppliers reduced lead times  b a continuation of the trend toward surface mount products and smaller part sizes  which traditionally have lower average selling prices  c an overall reduction in selling prices  d the uncertainties surrounding the asian economic crisis and e the strengthening of the us dollar and certain european currencies  which had a modest dampening effect on reported us dollar sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended march  decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the year ended march  overall sales prices in the year were lower compared to the year 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by the rising cost of palladium  a principle raw material used in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors 
continued automation of the manufacturing processes and higher volumes of through put in the factories have helped to reduce manufacturing costs for products sold and have enabled the company to maintain strong gross profit levels 
as a result of the company s strategy to manufacture in the various regions in which it sells products  the strengthening of the us dollar and certain european currencies acted to reduce the overall cost of manufacturing when reported in us dollars 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended march  were million of net sales  compared with million of net sales in the year ended march  the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses is due to higher research and development spending  higher sales commissions  and the benefit of adjustments to environmental remediation accruals in as a percentage of sales  such expenses have declined due to the company s stringent cost control measures 
research  development and engineering expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products  processes and technical innovations  were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of the above factors  profit from operations for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  for the reasons set forth above  higher interest income on invested cash and a million dividend from a nonmarketable equity investment  net income in the year ended march  increased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the year ended march  financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements  dividends and capital expenditures 
historically  the company has satisfied its liquidity requirements through internally generated funds 
as of march   the company had a current ratio of to  million of cash and cash equivalents  million of stockholders equity and an insignificant amount of long term debt 
net cash from operating activities was million for the year ended march   compared to million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  the increase is primarily a result of an intentional reduction of inventories  partially offset by lower earnings before depreciation and amortization 
purchases of property and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal virtually all expenditures related to expanding the production capabilities of the ceramic and tantalum surface mount  advanced and interconnect product lines 
the carrying value for the company s equipment reflects the fact that depreciation expense for machinery and equipment is generally computed using the accelerated double declining balance method 
the company continues to add additional capacity 
the company expects to construct additional facilities and purchase equipment totaling from million to million in fiscal on june   the company purchased the passive component business of thomson csf tpc for million  including the assumption of debt 
the company s net cash outlay was million during fiscal  the company invested million in a research and development company electro chemical research ltd 
ecr 
ecr has developed and patented a technology for high capacity electrical storage devices 
although the majority of the company s funding is internally generated  certain european subsidiaries of the company have borrowed german deutsche marks and french francs under various bank agreements 
these borrowings were used for working capital requirements and to repay other outstanding obligations 
in fiscal  and  dividends of million  million and million  respectively  were paid to stockholders 
in accordance with the company s stock repurchase program  the company is authorized to purchase million shares 
as of march  the company had purchased  shares at a cost of million during fiscal the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock 
the company has established reserves in the three years ended march  for its projected share of costs associated with the remediation of  and compliance with  environmental matters at various sites 
adjustments to such provisions and related expenditures have not been material in any of these periods 
based on the financial condition of the company as of march   the company believes that cash expected to be generated from operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy the company s anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  environmental clean up costs  research and development expenses  stock repurchases and any dividends to be paid for the foreseeable future 
year the year issue concerns the inability of information systems to properly recognize and process date sensitive information beginning january  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace some of its hardware and software so that those systems will properly process dates beyond december  however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
the company s procedures to resolve the year issue have involved four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the company has completed its assessment of all major systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the assessment indicated that most of the company s significant systems  such as customer order  manufacturing and accounting systems  could be affected 
for its information technology systems  the company is currently complete with the remediation phase for all major systems and expects to complete software reprogramming and replacement no later than june  after completing portions of the reprogramming and replacement of software  the company performs integrated testing and implementation 
the company has completed of its testing and has implemented of its remediated systems 
the testing and remediation of all major systems is expected to be completed by the quarter ending june and other systems should be completed by september for operating equipment systems  the company is currently complete with the remediation phase of the resolution process 
the company has completed of its testing and has implemented of its remediated equipment systems 
the testing and remediation of all critical equipment systems is expected to be completed by the quarter ending june and any other systems should be completed by september the company has queried its important raw material and service suppliers relative to their resolution of the year issue 
the company is not aware of any supplier problems that would materially impact results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the company has no means of ensuring that these entities will be year ready 
if important suppliers or customers are unable to complete their year resolution  it could materially impact the company 
the company does not yet have a comprehensive contingency plan with respect to the year issue  but intends to establish such a plan in the near future as part of its ongoing year effort 
the company is using both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test and implement  its software and operating equipment systems 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded through operating cash flows 
to date  the company has incurred approximately million million of which has been expensed and million capitalized for new software and equipment  related to all phases of the year project 
of the remaining estimated project costs  approximately million is allocated to the purchase of new software and equipment  which will be capitalized 
the remaining million relates to anticipated remediation  testing and implementation of hardware and software and will be expensed as incurred 
the company s plan to complete the year project discussed above is based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
estimates concerning the status of completion and expected completion dates are based on costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
for the quarter ended june  currently  the company is evaluating this standard and ithe impact it will have on the company s consolidated financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency the company s european sales  which account for approximately one third of company s revenues  generally are denominated in local currencies whereas those in north america and asia generally are denominated in us dollars 
also  certain manufacturing and operating costs denominated in local currencies are incurred in europe  asia  mexico and latin america 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the company s operating results and cash flow 
in order to minimize the effect of movements in currency exchange rates  the company periodically enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge external and intercompany foreign currency transactions 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
currency exchange gains and losses have been immaterial during the three years ended march  assuming a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currencies  with the resulting functional currency gains and losses translated into us dollars at the spot rate  the resulting net loss in fair value of exchange contracts held would not be material to the results  financial position or cash flows of the company 
euro on january  certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency  the euro 
the company has successfully completed all the necessary enhancements to its sales order  banking arrangements and operational procedures to ensure euro compliance 
the company is able to process orders  invoice customers and accept payment in euros throughout europe 
the introduction of the euro has not had any material adverse impact upon the company 
the company continues to monitor the risk of price erosion which could result from increased price transparency among countries using the euro 
precious metals the company is exposed to risk from fluctuations in prices for commodities used to manufacture its products  primarily palladium and tantalum 
palladium  a precious metal used in the manufacture of multilayer ceramic capacitors  is primarily purchased from various companies in the form of palladium sponge and ingot 
the main areas of mining of palladium are in russia and south africa 
palladium is considered a commodity and is subject to price volatility and has fluctuated in a range of approximately to per troy ounce during the past three years 
the company has managed  through the use of forward purchase agreements and strategic spot buying  to purchase palladium at below average market cost each year 
the company is aggressively stepping up its efforts to substitute base metals for precious metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors 
if the conversion to base metals occurs as planned  the company anticipates that  by the end of fiscal  it will have reduced its annual usage of palladium by 
assuming a hypothetical increase in the average cost of palladium purchased by the company  gross profit for the year ended march  would have been negatively impacted by approximately million 
tantalum powder is a principal material used in the manufacture of solid tantalum capacitors 
this product is purchased under annual contracts through suppliers from various parts of the world at prices that are subject to periodic adjustment 
the company is a major consumer of the world s annual tantalum production 
although the company believes that there is currently no problem with the procurement of tantalum powder and that the tantalum required by the company has generally been available in sufficient quantity to meet requirements  the limited number of tantalum powder suppliers could lead to higher prices 
assuming a hypothetical increase in the average cost of tantalum purchased by the company  gross profit for the year ended march  would have been negatively impacted by approximately million 
interest rate exposure interest rate exposure is centrally managed by offsetting surplus cash and deposits against borrowings on a currency by currency basis 
the company maintains an insignificant amount of foreign currency denominated long term and short term debt 
the term of these borrowings range from months to months  with both fixed and variable interest rates 
a adverse movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s operating results  financial position or cash flows
