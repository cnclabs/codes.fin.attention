book development costs  net of accumulated amortization were approximately  at december    at december   and  at december  the company recognizes income upon shipment of books 
historically  the company  which has a december year end  has recognized a significant portion of its sales in the last six months of each year  resulting from the year end holiday season and the spring season of the following year which is often shipped in december 
the company achieved approximately   and  respectively  of its total sales during the last six months of   and on march   the company signed an agreement and plan of merger with the hunt creative group  a related party 
the merger was accounted for as a combination of entities under common control  which is accounted for in a similar manner as a pooling of interest  and all financial numbers have been restated to include the results of the hunt group 
on march   the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately held fast forward marketing inc of marina del rey  california

the gross margin in without these charges would have been approximately 
once established  these reserves will offset charges in future periods for returns associated with sales which will increase gross profit margins
