adjusted to reflect a three for two stock split effective november  the company has traditionally reported lower profit margins in the first two quarters of each fiscal year than those experienced in the third and fourth quarters 
as part of the annual budget process  management establishes higher discretionary expense levels in relation to projected revenue for the first half of the year 
historically  the company s combined third and fourth quarter revenue has been greater than the first half of the year  as these two quarters coincide with clients calendar year budget periods and culmination of the company s annual sales plan 
this historically higher second half revenue has resulted in significantly higher profit margins since total expenses have not increased in proportion to revenue 
however  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance 
the company s products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of its clients information processing resources 
accordingly  in a recessionary environment  the company s products are often a reasonable economic alternative to customers faced with the prospect of incurring expenditures to increase their existing information processing resources 
however  a general or regional slowdown in the world economy could adversely affect the company s operations 
the company s future operating results may be affected by a number of other factors  including  but not limited to uncertainties relative to global economic conditions  the adequacy of the company s internal administrative systems to efficiently process transactions  store  and retrieve data subsequent to the year  the company s increasing reliance on a single family of products for a material portion of its sales  market acceptance of competing technologies  the availability and cost of new solutions  delays in delivery of new products or features  the company s ability to update its business application products to conform with the new  common european currency known as the euro  the company s ability to successfully maintain or increase market share in its core business while expanding its product base into other markets  the strength of its distribution channels  the ability either internally or through third party service providers to support client implementation of the company s products  the company s ability to manage fixed and variable expense growth relative to revenue growth  the company s ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  the company s ability to effectively integrate acquired products and operations 
with the acquisition of platinum technology international  inc 
platinum during the first quarter of fiscal year  there can be no assurances that the distractions and uncertainty caused by the acquisition will not have a negative effect on the company s revenue and net income as it completes the integration and restructuring of platinum s operations 
in process research and development there were no acquired in process technology charges in fiscal years and  and an after tax write off of million in related to the cheyenne acquisition 
acquired in process research and development in process r d charges relate to acquisitions of software companies accounted for under the purchase method  in which a portion of the purchase price is allocated to acquired in process technology and expensed immediately since the technological feasibility of the research and development projects have not yet been achieved and was believed to have no alternative future use 
an independent valuation was performed and used as an aid in determining the fair value of the identifiable assets and in allocating the purchase price among the acquired assets  including the portion of the purchase price attributed to in process r d 
the income approach was utilized for the valuation analysis 
this approach focuses on the income producing capability of the asset and was obtained through on site interviews with management  review of data provided by the company and cheyenne  and analysis of relevant market sizes  growth factors  and expected trends in technology 
the steps followed in applying this approach included estimating the expected cash flow over its life and converting these cash flows to present value through discounting 
the discounting process uses a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money and investment risk factors 
for cheyenne  future cash flows were projected over six years and discounted using a discount rate of approximately 
the company believes the discount rate is appropriate given the level of risk of unsuccessful completion of the technology 
cheyenne products consist of network data storage  security  and communications software across numerous standalone  as well as heterogeneous computer environments 
between november and march  the majority of the r d costs to complete the projects have been incurred 
the company has been benefiting from the acquired projects for approximately two years 
the company has reviewed its projections of revenue and estimated costs of completion and has compared these projections with results through march  to date  in the aggregate  the projects have not varied materially from original projections 
year the company has designed and tested substantially all of its recent product offerings to be year compliant 
these products have met rigorous compliance criteria and have undergone extensive review to detect any year failures 
the company has publicly identified any products that will not be updated to be year compliant and has been encouraging clients using these products to migrate to compliant versions products 
the company continues to update and test its product offerings 
in general  these year compliance efforts have been part of the company s ongoing software development process 
as such  incremental costs are not deemed material and have been included in net research and development expenses 
the year readiness of the company s customers varies  and the company continues to actively encourage its customers to prepare their own systems making available a broad array of product service and educational offerings 
these offerings are available on the ca year home page at http www 
cai 
com it is possible that the company may experience increased expense levels addressing migration issues for such customers 
there can be no assurances that the company s compliant products do not contain undetected problems associated with year compliance 
although the company believes that its license agreements provide it with protection against liability  the company cannot predict whether or to what extent any legal claims will be brought  or whether the company will suffer any potential liability as a result of any such adverse consequences to its customers 
the company recognizes the significance of the year issue as it relates to its internal systems including it and non it systems  and understands that the impact extends beyond traditional hardware and software to automated facility systems and third party suppliers 
the company has established a comprehensive four step plan assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation  with dedicated project managers to address year issues 
with regard to internal administrative and financial systems  the company has completed most conversion and testing efforts  with extended system integration testing and contingency planning projects scheduled throughout for its facility related systems telephone  voicemail  security  and so on  the company has conducted internal assessment audits and has sent questionnaires to vendors and service providers to confirm year readiness 
the company expects substantial completion of year readiness preparations by mid and to continue comprehensive testing throughout calendar as part of the contingency planning efforts  the company has created alternative strategies  when necessary  if significant exposures were identified up to and including the company s computer systems being rendered inoperable 
the contingency plan addresses these issues including temporary relocation of employees  manual workarounds  and the use of company owned generators and cellular phones 
the total cost of preparing internal systems to be year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
total expenditures  excluding personnel costs of existing staff  related to internal systems year readiness is expected to be less than million  with the vast majority of it paid to date 
such expenses commenced in and are projected to continue throughout calendar year the company believes that  although the risk of operational disruption from systems failures due to the year is minimal  there can be no assurances that the company will not experience significant unanticipated negative performance and or flaws in the technology used in its internal systems or interruptions in electrical power or other third party infrastructure services 
demand for certain of the company s products may be generated by customers who are replacing or upgrading computer systems to accommodate the year date change 
as a result  demand for some of the company s products may diminish as the year arrives  which could negatively impact the company s revenue growth rate 
additionally  because the company believes that some of its customers are allocating a substantial portion of their it budgets to year compliance  sales of certain of the company s traditional product offerings may be adversely affected through the end of fiscal year foreign currency exchange continued uncertainty in world economies and currency markets caused an additional strengthening of the us dollar during fiscal year approximately of the company s total revenue in fiscal year  in fiscal year  and in fiscal year  was derived from sales outside of north america 
western europe is the company s most important foreign market 
the company believes that its operations outside the us are located in countries which are politically and economically stable  with the possible exception of financial volatility in certain asian and latin american markets 
the net income effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations versus the us dollar on international revenue is largely offset to the extent expenses of the company s international operations are incurred and paid for in the same currencies as those of its revenue 
during fiscal year  the net income effect of foreign exchange transaction losses was approximately million 
a foreign currency translation adjustment of million was charged to stockholders equity in fiscal year as part of its risk management strategy and consistent with prior years  the company did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative transactions during fiscal year liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities at march  totaled million  an increase of million from the prior fiscal year

year to date cash generated from operations  excluding the withholding tax payment  totaled  million  an increase of from the prior year 
this increase is attributable to higher income before the one time charge  net of tax benefit  recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year related to the plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and issuance of debt

to further mitigate risk  the vast majority of the securities have a maturity date within one year 
holdings of any one issuer excluding the us government shall not exceed  and the portfolio is reviewed on a periodic basis and adjusted in the event that the credit rating of a security held in the portfolio has deteriorated 
at march   the company s outstanding debt approximated billion with approximately billion of fixed rate obligations 
if market rates decline  the company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on the current market rate
