the following table presents net sales and gross margin data of the company for the periods indicated fiscal years ended february  february  march  in thousands  except percentage data net sales retail tools    golf    catalog tools    golf    total    gross margin the company s catalog sales yield higher gross profit margins than retail store sales as a result of differences in product mix and greater promotional pricing in retail stores 
therefore  the company anticipates that its total gross profit as a percentage of net sales will decrease as retail store sales become a greater percentage of the company s total sales 
during fiscal  the company experienced a decrease in its gross profit as a percentage of net sales as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result the company s changing sales mix retail sales increased to of total sales as compared to of total sales 
with respect to both catalog and retail store operations  sales of golf products have yielded higher gross profit percentages than sales of tools

net retail sales for fiscal increased million or from million for fiscal to million 
however  net catalog sales for fiscal decreased million or  from million for the fiscal to million for fiscal the decrease in net catalog sales was attributable to the company s opening of retail stores in areas only previously served by its catalog as well as to distribution difficulties experienced during the first half of fiscal  which were a result of problems encountered during the implementation of a warehouse management system 
the company plans to continue its practice of not mailing catalogs to areas where it operates retail stores 
the revenue growth of retail stores is attributable to the maturation and expansion of the company s retail store base 
the store base expanded by from locations at the end of fiscal to locations at the end of fiscal for fiscal  comparable net store sales for tool and golf stores  increased by 
and  respectively  as compared to fiscal comparable net sales for all stores increased by for fiscal following is a summary of retail store growth

since the catalog business has higher gross margins than retail store operations  gross margins will decrease as catalog sales decrease 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal the dollar increases in selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily related to the company s continuing retail expansion to locations  which is a increase in the number of stores operated  as well as due to distribution difficulties experienced during the first half of fiscal  which were a result of problems encountered during the implementation of a warehouse management system 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to lower than anticipated sales  coupled with increases in selling and administrative expenses related to new stores and resolution of warehouse management implementation issues 
interest expense  net of interest income  for fiscal increased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was attributable to the increase in the amount outstanding under the company s bank credit facility 
fiscal versus fiscal net sales for fiscal increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a million  or  increase in net store sales  and a million  or  decrease in net catalog sales 
the increase in net store sales was primarily due to the net addition of new stores as well as the impact of a full year of operations for stores opened in the previous fiscal year 
in addition  comparable store sales increased by 
the company believes that the increase in comparable net store sales was a result of adopting a more promotional pricing strategy as well as closing stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal the decrease in net catalog sales was attributable to a decrease in sales from the company s trend lines catalog as compared to fiscal sales from the company s golf day catalog increased as compared to fiscal the opening of retail stores in areas previously only serviced by its catalogs has resulted in a decrease in the company s catalog sales in those areas 
gross profit for fiscal increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the company s changing sales mix 
the catalog business has both substantially higher gross margins and expenses than does a retail store 
therefore  as the contribution from retail stores becomes a larger proportion of total sales  gross margins and selling  general and administrative expense will have a natural downward bias 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily related to the company s retail expansion 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased operational efficiencies associated with the company s expansion and the lower cost of operating retail stores as compared to catalog operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million  representing the costs associated with reorganizing its operations 
these costs included the rent and related expenses for the closing of retail store locations  of which were closed late in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the remainder were closed in fiscal  and expenses related to the consolidation of the company s distribution centers and the severance and related benefits for terminated employees 
approximately 
million and million was charged against the restructuring reserve in fiscal and  respectively  and as of february  the restructuring was complete 
interest expense  net of interest income for fiscal  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is attributable to an increase in the company s bank debt  including the borrowing for the acquisition of golf acquisition limited partnership and related bank debt interest rate 
liquidity and capital resources the company incurred operating losses during fiscal and used funds provided by its bank credit facility to meet its cash operating needs 
the bank credit facility agreement contains certain financial covenants  including  but not limited to  maintaining minimum levels of tangible net worth and interest coverage ratios and limitations on capital expenditures 
at february   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants 
pursuant to an amendment with its bank dated as of february   the bank amended the credit facility with respect to the commitment level of the facility as well as financial covenants and advance rates for future periods 
the commitment level of the credit facility was increased from million to million 
the modified covenants require the company to maintain an interest coverage ratio of for the second half of fiscal  for the nine months ended may   and  on a rolling month basis for each quarter  thereafter 
the adjusted tangible net worth as of the last day of fourth fiscal quarter of and first fiscal quarter of must be at least million  the second and third fiscal quarter of must be at least million  and for the fourth fiscal quarter and each fiscal quarter thereafter  adjusted tangible net worth must be at least million 
capital expenditures may not exceed million for fiscal and million for any fiscal year thereafter 
the company believes that projected cash flows from operations in combination with current available resources are sufficient to meet working capital needs  such as store openings and debt payments 
achievement of projected cash flows from operations  however will be dependent upon the company s attainment of sales  gross profit  expense and trade support levels that are consistent with its financial plans 
such operating performance will be subject to financial  economic and other factors affecting the industry and operations of the company  including factors beyond its control  and there can be no assurance that the company s plans will be achieved 
in addition  the company borrows funds on a variable rate basis and continued compliance with loan covenants is partially dependent on relative interest rate stability 
if projected cash flows from operations are not realized  or if there are significant increases in interest rates  then the company may have to explore various available alternatives  including obtaining further modification to its existing lending arrangements or attempting to locate additional sources of financing 
the company s working capital decreased by million  from million as of february  to million as of february  the decrease resulted primarily from an increase in the net borrowings under the company s bank credit facility of million  which was offset by a million increase in inventory 
during fiscal  the cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
the primary uses of the cash were for a net loss of million  a million increase in inventories  and a million decrease in deferred income taxes  all of which was offset by a million increase in accounts payable 
the net cash used in investing activities was approximately million 
the main use of the cash was for the purchase of property and equipment required for the company s retail expansion 
the net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  primarily attributable to the increase in borrowings on the company s bank credit facility of million 
during fiscal  the company entered into a secured line of credit agreement with a bank the credit facility that  as amended during fiscal  expires on december  the credit facility bears interest at the bank s reference rate plus 
at february  or libor plus at february  
if for any month rolling period the fixed charges ratio exceeds certain limits  as defined  the bank s interest rate on the credit facility is decreased by 
for the period immediately following such rolling period 
a commitment fee of 
per year of the average unused commitment amount  as defined  is payable monthly 
the credit facility allows for borrowing up to million based on a percentage of inventory the advance rate 
borrowings include of the amounts reserved for outstanding letters of credit 
at february   the company had approximately million of borrowings outstanding and approximately 
million of letters of credit outstanding 
the company had approximately million in available borrowings under this facility at february  the bank has a security interest in substantially all assets of the company 
the bank credit facility agreement contains certain financial covenants  including  but not limited to  maintaining minimum levels of tangible net worth  and interest coverage ratios and limitations on capital expenditures 
the company anticipates that in fiscal  it will continue to invest in leasehold improvements and equipment to support its retail store expansion plans 
in addition  the company s expansion plans will require the use of cash to fund increased inventories associated with the operation of additional retail stores 
the company estimates that the cost of opening a new tool store exclusive of distribution center inventory averages approximately  of which  consists of inventory 
the cost of opening a new golf store is approximately  of which  consists of inventory 
in each case  a portion of the inventory investment is financed with trade credit 
the company opened new tool stores and new golf stores  and closed tool stores and golf stores in fiscal for fiscal  the company currently plans to open ten to fifteen stores 
year like many other companies  the year computer issue creates risk for the company 
if both information technology systems and imbedded technology do not correctly recognize date information on and subsequent to january   it could have an adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company is currently updating its software to accommodate programming logic that properly interprets year dates  which is planned to be completed by september  a review of embedded technology used in equipment provided by outside vendors with the manufacturers of such equipment  is planned to be completed by july  the company does not anticipate difficulty in resolving issues related to embedded technology in the equipment provided by other manufacturers 
the company is also inquiring of important third party vendors regarding their readiness  and this review is planned to be completed by july  except for merchandising and call center applications  all software is under maintenance agreements by software companies that provide updated  year compliant software 
the company is in the process of replacing its call center and merchandising software with new  year compliant applications to be supplied by outside vendors at a cost estimated at approximately million 
this new software is planned to be installed  tested and fully functional by august  funds for this expenditure will be provided by either operating activities or the company s revolving credit facility 
based on the company s work to date and assuming that the company s call center and merchandising software replacement projects can be implemented as planned  the company believes that it will be year compliant and that future costs relating to the year issue will not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
since the company relies on third party suppliers for many systems  products and services including merchandise  telecommunications and call center support  the company could be adversely affected if these suppliers do not make necessary changes to their own systems and products successfully and in a timely manner  and there can be no assurance that such third parties will provide complete or accurate year readiness disclosures 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
nevertheless  since it is not possible to anticipate all possible future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there could be circumstances in which the company could be adversely affected 
for example  the company could encounter problems in taking customer orders  shipping products  invoicing customers or collecting payments 
the amount of potential lost revenue or related consequences as a result of these unlikely contingencies has not been estimated 
the company expects to evaluate the status of its contingency plans after it has completed the remediation phase of the yk project for its information systems 
in addressing issues not resolved or contemplated for its systems  the company plans to allocate internal resources and may retain dedicated consultants and vendor representatives to be available to take corrective action  if necessary 
however  the company will adjust and adopt additional plans if situations arise requiring modifications to existing contingency plans or new contingency plans  as required 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its net sales or results of operations
