should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated or projected

general twa operates in an intensely competitive environment 
the company competes with one or more major airlines on most of its routes including all routes between major cities 
the airline industry has consolidated as a result of mergers and liquidations and more recently through alliances  and further consolidation may occur in the future 
this consolidation has  among other things  enabled certain of the company s major competitors to expand their international operations and increase their domestic market presence  thereby strengthening their overall operations  by transporting passengers connecting with or otherwise traveling on the alliance carriers 
such alliances could further intensify the competitive environment 
the rapid growth of regional jet airline affiliates represents a significant competitive challenge for twa due to its reliance on through hub passenger traffic 
a small regional jet can now offer direct service in markets that previously were served only by through hub service 
twa s current iam contracts limit twa from directly competing with regional jets in these markets 
these issues represent a competitive challenge for the company  which has higher operating costs than many regional carriers and fewer financial resources than many of its major competitors 
small fluctuations in rasm and casm can significantly affect twa s financial results 
the company has experienced significant operating losses on an annual basis since the early s  except in when the company s combined operating profit was million 
twa expects the airline industry will remain extremely competitive for the foreseeable future 
the company continues to focus on implementing several strategic initiatives to improve operational reliability and schedule integrity and overall product quality in order to attract higher yield passengers and enhance overall productivity 
key initiatives currently in progress include modernizing its fleet  focusing on improved productivity  implementing a series of revenue enhancing marketing initiatives to attract higher yield business travelers  implementing a number of employee related initiatives to reinforce the company s focus on operational performance  and optimizing twa s route structure 
twa faces a number of uncertainties that may adversely affect its future results of operations  including insufficient levels of air passenger traffic resulting from  among other things  war  threat of war  terrorism or changes in the economy  governmental limitations on the ability of twa to service certain airports and or foreign markets  regulatory requirements necessitating additional capital or operating expenditures  pricing and scheduling initiatives by competitors  the availability and cost of capital  increases in fuel and other operating costs  the outcome of certain ongoing labor negotiations  and the adverse effects on yield of the continued implementation of a discount ticket program between twa and karabu corporation  a company controlled by carl icahn  on the terms currently applied by karabu 
twa believes these terms are inconsistent with  and in violation of  the ticket agreement governing this program 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
twa is unable to predict the potential affect of any of these uncertainties upon its future results of operations 
labor costs wage rates for most of twa s employees have increased recently as a result of several events 
a new collective bargaining agreement between twa and its pilots became effective september  as part of the new contract  twa agreed to pay increases over the next four years that will result in wages for twa s pilots improving by to of the industry average as determined by wage rates in contracts in effect as of august the contract also provides for significant work rule improvements for pilots in certain areas while also granting twa flexibility and improvements necessary to enhance its competitive position 
under the contract  twa also will distribute either one million shares of twa s common stock or million in cash to its pilots  in four equal quarterly payments commencing in twa has the option to make each quarterly payment in shares or in cash 
pursuant to the labor agreements twa entered into in  twa agreed to pay to employees represented by the iam a cash bonus for the amount by which overtime incurred from september through august was reduced below specified thresholds 
this amount was to be offset by the failure of medical savings to meet certain specified levels during the period for the same employees 
twa and the iam have agreed that the net overtime bonus owed to the iam is million  which amount twa previously provided and reflected as a liability in its financial statements 
the obligation is payable in three equal annual installments  and twa made the first payment on october  twa also entered into agreements subsequent to the labor agreements that provide for an adjustment to existing salary rates of certain labor represented employees based on the amount of the cash bonus for overtime to the employees represented by the iam as described in the previous paragraph 
these adjustments equated to a increase which management made effective for all employee groups on september   except for pilots whose contract provided for separate increases also effective september   and the officers of twa who did not receive the increase 
management intends that the salary adjustments will be part of any percentage increase that would be incorporated in contract amendments currently being negotiated 
there are certain issues relating to agreements with employees  the resolution of which could result in significant non cash charges to future operating results of twa 
shares granted or purchased at a discount under the esip will generally result in a charge equal to the fair market value of shares granted and the discount for shares purchased at the time these shares are earned or purchased 
as a result of the first two target prices being realized on february   and march   respectively  the company issued an additional  shares on july   to satisfy the and esip grant amounts 
in connection with such issuance  twa recorded an aggregate non cash charge in the first quarter of in the amount of million 
an aggregate non cash charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of to reflect the actual number of shares issued on july  if the esip s remaining target prices for twa common stock are realized  the minimum aggregate non cash charge for the years to will be approximately million based upon these target prices and the number of shares of common stock and employee preferred stock outstanding at december  the non cash charge for any year  however  could be substantially higher if the then market price of the twa common stock exceeds certain target prices 
in connection with certain wage scale adjustments afforded to non contract employees  employees previously represented by iffa have asserted and won an arbitration ruling with respect to the comparability of wage concessions made in that  if sustained  would require twa to provide additional compensation to these employees 
the eighth circuit court of appeals upheld a district court ruling that affirmed the arbitrator s award 
twa has filed a motion before the district court for the eastern district of missouri seeking referral of the matter to the system board of adjustment for determination on twa s claim that  to the extent it was unsuccessful on the merits  actions taken by twa following issuance of the arbitrator s award and in accordance with the arbitrator s opinion have substantially  if not totally  mitigated potential damages 
accordingly  the company has not recorded any liability for this litigation 
the iam now collective bargaining agent for employees formerly represented by iffa has filed a motion requesting the district court to hold twa in contempt of court and to order twa to implement the arbitration award 
twa believes that pending the district court s ruling on twa s motion to remand  twa is not required to implement the arbitration award and the iam s motion is without merit 
the amount  if any  due under the award is incapable of being determined pending the district court s ruling on twa s motion and  if remanded  the decision of the system board of adjustment 
twa is currently engaged in negotiations with its flight attendants and ground employees on new collective bargaining agreements and expects that the new agreements with these employees will likely result in additional increases in wage rates 
twa believes it is essential that its labor costs remain favorable in comparison to its largest competitors 
the company will seek to continue to improve employee productivity as an offset to any wage increases and will continue to explore other ways to control and or reduce operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such productivity improvements or unit cost reductions 
in the opinion of management  the company s financial resources are not as great as those of most of its competitors  and therefore  a substantial increase in its labor costs as a result of any new labor agreements or any cessation or disruption of operations due to any strike or work action could be particularly damaging to the company 
seasonality due to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months  airline industry revenues for the third quarter of the year are generally significantly greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year and moderately greater than revenues in the second quarter of the year 
in the last two years  twa has attempted to reduce the seasonal nature of its business through an acceleration of its fleet renewal program  a decrease in international operations  and the restructuring of its jfk operations  with the result that the difference between twa s seasonal average daily peak and trough capacities relating to available seat miles asms has dropped from in and in to in twa anticipates that the seasonal variability of its financial performance will be reduced but not eliminated as a result of these changes  however  there can be no assurance that this deseasonalization will occur

results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  total operating revenues of  million for were million or less than the total operating revenues of  million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily reflected in twa passenger revenues  which were million less than in  domestic passenger revenue increased year over year by million  however  international passenger revenue decreased by million resulting from the reduction of certain unprofitable international operations and the planned reduction in capacity as the company replaced older l and b aircraft with new b and b aircraft on many routes 
revenue from freight and mail also decreased million as a result of the reduction in capacity 
additionally  revenues from contract work decreased million primarily due to an overall reduction in third party maintenance as the company focused its resources on maintenance of its own aircraft 
as a result of the company s planned retirement of older widebody aircraft and elimination of unprofitable services  capacity and traffic decreased in as compared to system wide capacity  measured in available seat miles flown in scheduled service  decreased by in as compared to reflecting a decrease in domestic available seat miles and a decrease in international available seat miles 
this capacity change reflects the continued planned leveling of twa s seasonal schedules and the reduction in international operations

operating expenses decreased to  million including million in special charges in  million less than the total operating expenses of  million for the year ended december   representing a net change in the following expense groups salaries  wages and benefits of  million for were million less than  primarily due to a decrease in the average number of employees  offset by increases in wage rates 
the average number of employees declined to  in as compared to  in a reduction of the number of employees occurred in several areas  particularly those impacted by the reduction in flying or maintenance of older narrow and widebody aircraft 
earned stock compensation charges of million for versus million for represent the non cash compensation charge recorded to reflect the expense associated with the distribution of shares of stock on behalf of employees as part of the reorganization 
the charge is related to incentive shares issued in july under the esip as a result of the achievement of certain common stock target prices in february and march the charge is related to the allocation of shares to the pilots employee benefit plan the esop  which became fully allocated in aircraft fuel and oil expense of million for was million less than expenses of million for approximately million of the decrease was due to a reduction in the average cost of fuel from cents per gallon in to cents per gallon in the remaining million decrease was due to the reduction in gallons consumed million gallons in compared to million gallons in resulting from the replacement of b  l and b aircraft with more fuel efficient b  b and md aircraft and the elimination of certain unprofitable international routes 
passenger sales commission expense of million for was million less than the expense of million in primarily due to a decrease in average domestic commission rates due to a reduction in domestic base commission rates in october and a commission cap implemented in may  a decrease in domestic commissionable tickets sold during versus  resulting in part from an increase in electronic ticketing  and a decrease in commissions on international passenger revenues  which declined as the company continued to restructure its international operations 
aircraft maintenance material and repairs expense of million for represented a decrease of million from million for the decrease was primarily the result of higher levels of maintenance on narrow body aircraft during  reduced material usage on wide body aircraft and engines in due to the retirement of the b and l fleets  a reduction in unprofitable contract maintenance work performed on both government and commercial aircraft and engines  and the effect of adding new lower maintenance b  b and md aircraft to the fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in to million compared to million in depreciation of aircraft increased million primarily as a result of the purchase of five b aircraft previously leased by twa under operating leases from the end of through the first six months of  which was partially offset by reduced depreciation  amortization and obsolescence provided for the b and l fleets  which were retired 
operating lease rentals of million for were million more than the rentals of million for aircraft lease rentals increased million versus reflecting additional new b and md aircraft leases in which replaced older l and b wide body aircraft and b aircraft retired from the fleet 
the remainder of the increase million related to a non recurring charge of million for certain retroactive facilities rentals in addition to increased space rentals at other airports 
passenger food and beverage expense of million during represented an increase of million from million during the increase was related to a significant increase of in first class enplaned passengers and associated improved menu offerings primarily in twa s domestic first class trans world first and international business trans world one services partially offset by a slight decline in coach enplaned passengers of and selective menu changes to mitigate the overall cost impact 
overall  scheduled boardings were higher than boardings 
during the fourth quarter of  special charges of million were recorded in connection with the elimination of excess overhead items and the company s ongoing fleet renewal program 
these charges included million related to the planned retirement of b and non hushkitted dc fleets and million for the ongoing restructuring of international operations and the closure of the los angeles reservations office  both of which include significant employee severance costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these special charges 
all other operating expenses increased million to million in from million during the year ended december  expenses increased in several categories including computerized reservation system fees million  worldspan transaction fees million  advertising and publicity primarily associated with the launch of new twa services including trans world first  twq and the aviators frequent flier program million  legal fees and expenses million and uncollectible accounts million 
offsetting decreases occurred as a result of lower insurance premiums and uninsured losses million and expenses related to twa s subsidiary  getaway vacations  million 
other charges credits were a net charge of million for  compared to million for interest expense increased million in over as a result of the addition of new debt during and the latter part of interest and investment income increased by million in primarily as a result of higher levels of invested funds 
dispositions of assets resulted in net gains of million in  compared to million in the net gains in primarily included the sale of certain retired  wide body aircraft  engines and other surplus equipment while the net gains in related to the sale of three gates at newark international airport and spare flight equipment 
other charges and credits net improved by million to a net credit of million for from a net credit of million for in may  the us supreme court refused to hear an appeal of a decision reversing a judgment against twa in an action brought by travellers 
accordingly  a cash undertaking previously posted by twa of million was returned to twa in june and recorded as a credit in the second quarter 
after deduction of million for reimbursement of certain administrative costs previously incurred by twa  million received pursuant to this proceeding was applied in july to reduce the promissory notes issued to the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc notes pursuant to a pre existing agreement 
partially offsetting this favorable change was a decrease in twa s equity in the earnings of worldspan million and an increase in provisions for losses resulting from claims and litigation judgments against twa million 
the provision for income taxes in and related primarily to foreign taxes 
in future periods  the amortization of reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and certain other non deductible items will likely result in the company s effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes exceeding statutory rates  notwithstanding the company s substantial net operating loss carryforwards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the above  the operating loss of million for was million greater than the operating loss of million for and the net loss of million for was million greater than the net loss of million for the operating and net losses for included special charges for nonrecurring items of million as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the net loss also included million in extraordinary charges related to the early extinguishment of debt while the net loss included million of such charges 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  total operating revenues of  million for were million or less than the total operating revenues of  million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily reflected in twa passenger revenues  which were million less than in  resulting from the elimination of certain unprofitable international destinations and the planned reduction in capacity as the company replaced older l and b aircraft with new b  b and md aircraft on many routes 
additionally  revenues from contract work decreased million primarily due to the termination of an unprofitable aircraft maintenance contract with the u 
s 
government and overall reduction in other third party maintenance as the company focused its resources on maintenance of its own aircraft 
revenue from freight and mail also decreased million as a result of the reduction in capacity 
as a result of the company s planned retirement of older widebody aircraft and elimination of unprofitable services  capacity and traffic decreased in as compared to system wide capacity  measured in asms  decreased by in as compared to reflecting a decrease in domestic asms and a decrease in international asms 
passenger traffic volume  as measured by total rpms in scheduled service  decreased in over passenger load factor for was compared to in twa s yield per passenger mile increased from cents in to cents in reflecting the company s efforts to improve productivity and reduce operating costs  operating expenses declined to  million in  million lower than the total operating expenses of  million for the year ended december   representing a net change in the following expense groups salaries  wages and benefits of  million for were million less than  primarily due to a decrease in the average number of employees 
the average number of employees declined to  in as compared to  in a reduction of the number of employees occurred in several areas  particularly those impacted by the reduction in flying or maintenance of older narrow and widebody aircraft 
earned stock compensation charges of million for and million for represent primarily the non cash compensation charge recorded to reflect the expense associated with the distribution of shares of stock on behalf of employees as part of the reorganization 
for a further discussion of future charges related to non cash compensation  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
aircraft fuel and oil expense of million for was million less than expenses of million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses was primarily due to decreases in the price of fuel million and in gallons consumed million 
passenger sales commission expense of million for was million less than the expense of million in primarily related to the million decrease in twa passenger revenues 
other factors contributing to the decrease were a reduction in commission rates in october and a decrease in the percentage of commissionable sales resulting in decreases in commission expense of million and million  respectively 
aircraft maintenance materials and repairs expense of million in represented a decrease of million from million for the decrease was primarily the result of higher levels of scheduled maintenance in  including heavy maintenance  a decrease in flying hours in versus  addition of new aircraft and retirement of old aircraft from twa s fleet  and a decrease in contract repair work performed by the company for other air carriers and third parties 
the average age of twa s operating fleet decreased from years at december  to years at december  depreciation and amortization expense decreased million from million in to million in primarily represented by decreases in the provision for obsolescence million  depreciation of aircraft million and amortization of intangible assets million 
the decrease in obsolescence was significantly related to the retirement of l and b aircraft fleets and its replacement with newer aircraft fleets 
the decrease in aircraft depreciation was related to b  b and l fleets becoming fully depreciated partially offset by increased depreciation on b  b and dc fleets related to new aircraft acquisitions and aircraft modifications on the dc aircraft associated with noise compliance and aging aircraft 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets was related to the write off of the carrying value of twa s new york to athens route authority as a result of twa s decision to discontinue unprofitable service to athens and the sale of three gates at newark international airport in early operating lease rentals of million for were million more than the total rentals of million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of aircraft under operating leases from in to in and higher lease rates attributed to the introduction of newer aircraft into the fleet 
passenger food and beverage expense of million in represented a decrease of million from million for the twelve months of the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of passengers boarded on international flights resulting from the reduction in international scheduled asms together with savings derived from changes and improved efficiencies in food and beverage service 
during the fourth quarter of  special charges of million were recorded in connection with the company s decision to modify its international route structure and related aircraft fleet plan 
the charges included a write off of the carrying value of twa s new york athens route authority million and international employee severance liabilities million related to the termination of service to athens and frankfurt 
the special charges also included a reduction in carrying value of twa s owned l and b fleets million and the related inventories million 
these charges were based upon management s estimate of the amounts to be realized upon the disposition of these assets when removed from service 
actual amounts could materially differ from such estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these special charges 
all other operating expenses decreased million to million in from million during the year ended december  decreases were noted in the cost of services sold million  cost of services purchased million  advertising and publicity million  navigation charges million  landing fees million  subsidiary expenses million  uncollectible accounts million  taxes other than income million and numerous other miscellaneous categories 
these decreases were primarily related to twa s planned reductions in capacity reduction in system scheduled asms and maintenance performed for third parties 
other charges credits were a net charge of million for as compared to million for interest expense decreased million in over as a result of the reduction of debt arising from the restructuring and additional reductions of debt during and interest income decreased by million in primarily as a result of lower levels of invested funds 
dispositions of assets resulted in a net gain of million in  compared to a net loss of million in the net gain in included million from the sale of three gates at newark international airport and million from the sale of aircraft  engines and other property 
other charges and credits net were unfavorable by million in compared to  primarily due to a million decline in foreign currency translation adjustments  a million decrease in vendor discounts and a million credit in to reflect a litigation settlement 
the provision for income taxes in and related primarily to foreign taxes 
in future periods  the amortization of reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and certain other non deductible items will likely result in the company s effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes exceeding statutory rates  notwithstanding the company s substantial net operating loss carryforwards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the above  the operating loss of million for was million less than the operating loss of million for the net loss of million for was million less than the net loss of million for the operating and net losses for included special charges for nonrecurring items of million as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the net loss also included million in extraordinary charges related to the early extinguishment of debt while the net loss included million of such charges 
liquidity and capital resources the following is a discussion of the impact of significant factors affecting twa s liquidity position and capital resources 
these comments should be read in conjunction with  and are qualified in their entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
liquidity the company s consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million  a million increase from the december  balance of million 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents during was due  in large part  to cash provided by financing activities of million in versus million in sources of cash generated by financing activities included proceeds from the sale of notes of million and million from the sale and leaseback of certain aircraft and engines in versus proceeds of million from notes and warrants issued  million from the sale and leaseback of certain aircraft and million from the sale of preferred stock in these proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of long term debt and capital lease obligations of million in versus million in the unfavorable change in cash used by operating activities reflects an increase in the net loss from to of million 
additionally  net discounted sales from tickets sold under the month karabu ticket program agreement between the company and karabu have been excluded from cash flows from operating activities as the related amounts were applied to reduce certain loans to the company provided by karabu the icahn loans and the pbgc notes 
during  million of these proceeds was applied to reduce the pbgc notes 
in  the proceeds applied to reduce the icahn loans were million in addition to million applied to reduce the pbgc notes 
on december   twa repaid the outstanding balance of the icahn loans out of the proceeds of a receivables securitization offering by the company 
in december  the pbgc note were paid in full primarily with the proceeds from ticket sales 
accordingly  proceeds from the sales of tickets under the karabu ticket agreement are now paid directly to twa 
accounts payable and accrued expenses also generated a use of cash in of million primarily due to the timing of payments of certain obligations compared to providing cash in of million 
cash used by investing activities was million in compared to million in components of this net change include an increase in capital expenditures including aircraft pre delivery payments to million in versus million in however  gross proceeds from assets sold during were million primarily from the sale of retired  wide body aircraft  engines and other surplus equipment while proceeds of million represented million for three gates at newark international airport and approximately million primarily from the sale of spare flight equipment  aircraft and engines 
additionally  approximately million was provided in primarily due to the release of cash from previously restricted deposits and the release of cash collateral supporting certain letters of credit 
cash provided by financing activities and cash used in investing activities exclude a total of million principal amount of notes issued by twa in as consideration for the purchase of aircraft 
in july  million principal amount of these notes were converted into twa common stock 
capital resources twa generally must satisfy all of its working capital expenditure requirements from cash provided by operating activities  from external capital sources or from the sale of assets 
however  twa has pledged a substantial portion of its assets to secure various issues of outstanding debt 
twa s financing agreements generally require twa to apply the sale proceeds from the sale of any pledged assets to repay the corresponding debt 
if twa is unable to obtain additional capital  the company may not be able to make certain capital expenditures or to continue to implement certain other aspects of its strategic plan  and twa may therefore be unable to achieve the full benefits expected from the plan 
commitments twa entered into an agreement in february with boeing for the purchase of ten b aircraft and related engines  spare parts and equipment for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
as of december   twa had taken delivery of six aircraft and had four on firm order 
five of the six aircraft already delivered were originally manufacturer financed and one was leased 
in separate transactions in june  july and october  these five manufacturer financed aircraft were sold to  and leased back from  an aircraft lessor 
the four remaining aircraft are scheduled to be delivered in and the first of these aircraft was delivered in march and was immediately sold to  and leased back under an operating lease from an aircraft lessor 
twa has obtained commitments for debt financing for approximately of the cost of acquiring two of the remaining three aircraft and commitments for lease financing of the cost of acquiring the remaining aircraft 
in september  twa entered into an agreement with boeing to acquire four additional b aircraft to be delivered during twa has obtained commitments for debt financing for approximately of the cost of acquiring these aircraft 
these commitments are subject to  among other things  material adverse change clauses that make the availability of this debt and lease financing dependent upon the financial condition of twa at the time of delivery 
the company has entered into an agreement for the operating lease for one additional b er and three additional b aircraft 
these aircraft are scheduled to be delivered in  excluding one b that is scheduled for delivery in january the company has granted to a major financial institution the option to purchase and leaseback to twa  under substantially the same terms and conditions as another b aircraft previously leased to twa in  four of the eight b aircraft to be delivered by boeing during in  twa entered into agreements with avsa  sarl airbus and rolls royce plc relating to the purchase of ten a twin engine wide body aircraft and related engines  spare parts and equipment for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
the agreements  as amended  require the delivery of the aircraft in and and provide for the purchase of up to ten additional aircraft 
twa has not yet made arrangements for the permanent financing of the purchases subject to the agreements 
in the event of cancellation  predelivery payments of approximately million may be subject to forfeiture 
in  twa entered into an agreement to acquire from boeing new md s  to be financed by long term leases 
as of december   twa had taken delivery of of the md aircraft and expects to take delivery of two additional planes in in april  twa entered into an agreement with boeing to acquire additional new md aircraft  with deliveries in the company has obtained commitments for long term debt and lease financing for these aircraft 
in december  twa announced that it had signed letters of intent to acquire an additional new aircraft boeing aircraft for delivery beginning in  airbus a aircraft for delivery beginning in and airbus a family aircraft for delivery beginning in in addition to these firm orders  twa has taken options on an additional boeing s and an additional a family aircraft 
the letter of intent includes financing for all of the firm order aircraft 
the terms of the purchase orders and the related financing are subject to further negotiation and the signing of definitive agreements 
these new aircraft would primarily replace b  dc and older md aircraft currently in twa s fleet 
twa elected to comply with the transition requirements of the noise act by adopting the stage aircraft phase out retrofit option  which requires that of its base level december stage fleet be phased out retrofitted by december  to comply with the requirement  the company has retrofitted  by means of engine hush kits  of its dc aircraft at an aggregate cost of approximately million  most of which was financed by lessors with repayments being facilitated through increased rental rates or lease term extensions 
twa complied with the transition requirements for december   by having of its fleet meet stage requirements through the grounding of older stage aircraft in combination with the acquisition of stage aircraft 
by december   of the fleet must meet stage requirements 
in february  twa signed letters of intent with an aircraft lessor to sell and leaseback six boeing aircraft which would subsequently be returned to the lessor and replaced with three boeing aircraft from the same aircraft lessor 
in connection with this transaction  the company has made an offer to purchase for cash up to million total principal amount of its outstanding senior secured notes due april  and any and all of its outstanding senior secured notes due june  collectively  the notes 
the offer to purchase is subject to the consummation of the sale by twa of the collateral that currently secures the notes 
the company had noncancellable operating leases in effect at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain other capital requirements twa generally does not commit to expenditures for facilities and equipment  other than aircraft  before purchase and  therefore  no such significant commitments exist at the present time 
twa s ability to finance these expenditures will depend in part on twa s financial condition at the time of the proposed expenditure 
year twa utilizes software and related computer technologies essential to its operations that use two digits rather than four to specify the year  which will result in a date recognition problem in the year and thereafter unless modified 
twa has completed an assessment to determine the changes needed to make its computer systems  internal operating systems and equipment year compliant and is executing a plan to implement these changes 
the company currently expects that it will complete the necessary changes and testing for its mission critical systems in the third quarter of twa estimates that the total cost to complete the remediation of its information technology systems is approximately million  which is approximately of the company s total information technology budget for the project duration period 
as of december   the company estimates that approximately of the cost to complete the remediation of its computer systems had been incurred 
as of december   approximately of the systems had been remediated 
twa has substantially completed assessments and begun remediation for the non information technology related systems 
the company currently estimates the remediation costs related to infrastructure and facilities enhancements necessary to prepare its systems for the year will range from million to million  which it plans to fund through operating cash flows 
the costs of the company s year project and the date on which it will be completed are based on management s best estimates and include assumptions regarding modification plans of third parties 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
twa has also reviewed software that was purchased from outside vendors and has evaluated its reliance on other third parties eg the faa  the dot  airport authorities  data providers and suppliers to determine and minimize the extent to which its operations may be dependent on these third parties to remediate the year issues in their systems 
outside vendors and other third parties have either provided twa with year compliant versions of their products or informed twa that all mission critical systems from such parties are in the process of being remediated 
to help insure compliance  twa is continuing to set up and perform independent testing with these systems 
although the company currently has day to day operational contingency plans  management is in the process of reviewing and modifying these plans for each mission critical system for possible year specific operational requirements 
twa s emphasis in this process is on passenger safety  and then on business continuity 
further  twa has been actively participating in the industry reviews led by the air transport association and the international air transport association 
twa s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the failure of its systems or those of other parties to operate properly beyond fuel hedging in september  twa entered into future jet fuel fixed price swaps with respect to a minor portion of its fuel requirements during to provide a hedging mechanism against significant increases in jet fuel prices 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fuel hedging activities 
reorganization during the period from through  twa underwent two separate chapter bankruptcy reorganizations  the first in  and the second in in connection with the reorganization  twa applied fresh start reporting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which resulted in the creation of a new reporting entity for accounting purposes and twa s assets and liabilities being adjusted to reflect fair values on the effective date of the reorganization 
as a result of the application of fresh start reporting  substantial values were assigned to routes  gates and slots million and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets million 
twa has evaluated its future cash flows and notwithstanding the operating losses experienced since the reorganization  expects that the carrying value of the intangibles at december   will be recovered
