item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview chiron is a biotechnology company that participates in three global healthcare businesses biopharmaceuticals  blood testing and vaccines 
the company is applying a broad and integrated scientific approach to the development of innovative products for preventing and treating cancer  infectious diseases  and cardiovascular diseases 
this approach is supported by research strengths in recombinant proteins  genomics  small molecules  gene therapy and vaccines 
chiron biopharmaceuticals consists of products and services related to therapeutics  with an emphasis on oncology  serious infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases as well as the development and acquisition of technologies related to recombinant technology  gene therapy  small molecule therapeutics and genomics 
chiron s blood testing revenues primarily relate to chiron s one half interest in the pretax operating earnings of its joint business with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc  which sells a full line of tests required to screen blood for hepatitis viruses and retroviruses  and provides supplemental tests and microplate based instrument systems to automate test performance and data collection 
chiron vaccines consists principally of adult and pediatric vaccines sold primarily in germany  italy  certain other international markets and in the us on december   chiron completed the sale of its ophthalmics business unit  chiron vision corporation chiron vision  to bausch lomb incorporated b l and on november   chiron completed the sale of its in vitro diagnostics business to bayer corporation bayer 
as a result of these transactions  the company s consolidated statements of operations reflect the after tax results of chiron vision and chiron diagnostics  and the related gains on disposals thereof  as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
results of operations revenues biopharmaceutical product sales product sales from chiron biopharmaceuticals were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in and  product sales consisted principally of proleukin r aldesleukin  interleukin  betaseron r interferon beta b and pdgf recombinant human platelet derived growth factor rhpdgf bb 
in  biopharmaceutical product sales consisted primarily of proleukin r and betaseron r 
proleukin r chiron sells proleukin r directly in the us and certain international markets 
sales of proleukin r were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the overall increase in sales from year to year is primarily due to i continued volume growth in existing indications  ii higher prices  and iii in  the geographic expansion into other countries and the expanded use of proleukin r for the new indication of metastatic melanoma 
the company continues to pursue additional indications related to human immunodeficiency virus hiv  acute myelogenous leukemia and hiv related non hodgkin s lymphoma 
the company also anticipates further geographic expansion of proleukin r into additional countries 
betaseron r chiron manufactures betaseron r for berlex laboratories  inc berlex and its parent company schering ag of germany 
chiron earns a partial payment for betaseron r upon shipment to berlex and schering ag the initial revenues and a subsequent secondary payment upon sales by berlex and schering ag the secondary revenues 
accordingly  chiron s revenues from betaseron r tend to fluctuate based upon the inventory management practices of berlex and schering ag 
in addition  in july  the terms of payment changed whereby the initial payment received upon shipment decreased and the secondary payment due upon sales to patients increased equivalently 
although total revenues did not change  the revised payment terms resulted in a timing difference whereby chiron recognized a decrease in initial revenues in and an increase in secondary revenues in in  and  revenues from betaseron r were million  million and million  respectively 
in  chiron s shipments of betaseron r to berlex and schering ag increased significantly over shipments in the actual number of vials sold by berlex and schering ag to patients in remained relatively constant with the number of vials sold in as a result  the increase in revenues in as compared with is primarily due to replenishing inventories at berlex and schering ag and to the change in payment terms discussed above 
in october  the contractual rate upon which chiron recognizes revenues decreased by of berlex s sales 
the impact of this decrease did not impact revenues until december when chiron began recognizing the subsequent secondary revenues 
in  the decrease in revenues as compared with is primarily due to the change in payment terms discussed above and the introduction of a competing product in the second quarter of pdgf chiron manufactures pdgf for ortho mcneil pharmaceutical  inc  a johnson johnson j j company 
pdgf is the active ingredient in regranex r becaplermin gel  a treatment for diabetic foot ulcers 
regranex r gel was approved by the food and drug administration fda in december and was launched commercially in early sales of pdgf were million and million  in and  respectively 
as chiron s shipments of pdgf remained fairly constant in and  the increase in revenues between and is primarily due to retroactive price increases recognized in for shipments made in the company does not expect future price adjustments  if any  to be commensurate with those in as pdgf is the first product of its kind  the company believes it will take time for the market to fully develop 
in addition  chiron s sales of pdgf will tend to fluctuate based upon the inventory management practices of j j 
regranex r gel was recently approved for use in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in canada and the company expects european approval for the same indication during the first half of however  even with these approvals  chiron s sales to date have largely filled j j s inventory requirements  and as a result  no sales of pdgf to j j are expected during the first three quarters of vaccine product sales chiron sells pediatric and adult vaccines in germany  italy  other international markets and in the us certain of the company s vaccine products  particularly its flu vaccine  are seasonal and have higher sales in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
in  and  vaccine product sales were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in sales in as compared with is primarily due to chiron s acquisition of the remaining interest in  and consolidation of  chiron behring gmbh co chiron behring in the second quarter of see chiron behring below 
in  the decrease in product sales as compared with reflects the supply constraints related to polioral tm  the company s pediatric oral polio vaccine  which were resolved during the company expects the competitive pressures related to many of its vaccine products to continue into the foreseeable future  as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market  including new combination vaccines 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint businesses in  and  chiron recognized equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint businesses of million  million and million  respectively 
in each of these years  equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint businesses consisted substantially of revenues generated by chiron s joint businesses with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc ortho  a johnson johnson company chiron ortho joint business and hoechst ag chiron behring 
chiron ortho joint business in  and  chiron s share of the pretax operating earnings of the chiron ortho joint business was million  million and million  respectively 
at the end of each year  the joint business records an annual inventory adjustment 
as chiron recognizes revenues from the joint business on a lag basis  this adjustment is typically made during the first quarter of each year 
in  the annual inventory adjustment for resulted in a million charge as compared with million of income in and million of income in other items contributing to the decrease in earnings in as compared with were i lower foreign profits of the joint business due to the adverse impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates between years and higher manufacturing costs  ii certain one time contract termination fees  and iii certain joint business asset write offs related to the implementation of certain processes to comply with stricter fda guidelines mandated throughout the industry 
chiron behring on july   chiron acquired a interest in chiron behring 
on march   chiron acquired the remaining interest in chiron behring refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
from july  through the first quarter of  equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint businesses included chiron s share of the after tax operating results of chiron behring 
chiron s share of earnings of the joint venture  including amortization of intangibles  was million for the three months ended march   million for the year ended december  and million for the six months ended december  beginning march   chiron behring s results were consolidated with those of the company 
collaborative agreement revenues chiron recognizes collaborative agreement revenues for fees received for research services as they are performed and fees received upon attainment of specified milestones 
collaborative agreement revenues tend to fluctuate based on the amount of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of the company s collaborative agreement revenue  results in any one year are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
the company s ability to generate additional collaborative agreement revenues may depend  in part  on its ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
there can be no assurance that such relationships will be established or that current collaborative agreement revenues will not decline 
significant fluctuations in collaborative agreement revenues from year to year are discussed below 
novartis ag chiron and novartis ag novartis entered into an agreement under which novartis agreed to provide research funding for certain projects 
the funded projects currently consist of adult and pediatric vaccines  insulin like growth factor i  factor viii and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase hsv tk 
novartis has agreed to fund  at chiron s request and subject to certain annual and aggregate limits  up to of the development costs of these projects incurred between january  and december  under this agreement  in  and  chiron recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
under the terms of a november agreement with novartis  chiron granted novartis a license to utilize chiron s combinatorial chemistry techniques 
in exchange for this license  novartis agreed to pay chiron million over a five year period  subject to certain adjustments 
in addition  this agreement provides for research funding by novartis  and certain upfront  milestone and royalty payments  as well as product commercialization rights for both parties 
in connection with this agreement  chiron recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
in november  chiron and novartis entered into a consent order with the federal trade commission pursuant to which chiron agreed to grant a royalty bearing license to rhone poulenc rorer  inc under certain chiron patents related to the hsv tk gene in the field of gene therapy 
chiron and novartis entered into a separate agreement which provided  among other things  for certain cross licenses between chiron and novartis  and under which  novartis agreed to pay chiron up to million over five years 
in connection with this agreement  chiron recognized collaborative agreement revenues of million in both and japan tobacco in  japan tobacco licensed chiron s combinatorial chemistry technologies for use in its research and development programs 
the agreement  which was terminated in  included certain funding for chiron s effort in transferring the technology 
revenues recognized under this agreement were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
green cross of japan in  green cross of japan agreed to reimburse chiron for certain hiv research  product development and clinical trials 
in  the clinical trials related to this collaboration were discontinued 
in  and  chiron recognized revenues related to this agreement of million  million and million  respectively 
royalty and license fee revenues the company receives royalties and license fees for products or technologies that are marketed  distributed or used by third parties 
in  and  chiron recognized royalty and license fee revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
royalty and license fee revenues may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements and the timing of receipt of license fees 
results in any one year are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  the company s ability to generate additional royalty and license fee revenues may depend  in part  on its ability to market and capitalize on its technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so or that future royalty and license fee revenues will not decline 
significant fluctuations in royalty and license fee revenue from year to year are discussed below 
roche pcr agreement in accordance with a july agreement with f 
hoffman laroche ltd 
and its affiliates roche  the company receives royalties on sales of polymerase chain reaction pcr products sold by roche 
in  chiron recognized million of royalty and license fee revenues related to this agreement 
based on the terms of the agreement  chiron does not earn royalties on pcr products until roche s annual net sales of pcr products and services exceed million the threshold amount 
as the threshold amount resets at the beginning of each year  roche s annual net sales must exceed million before chiron will earn any royalties 
as a result  the company does not expect to recognize royalties under this agreement until the last half of each year 
this agreement expires upon the earlier of december  or chiron s recognition of an aggregate net present value of million as of the date of the agreement discounted at 
bayer cross license agreement in connection with the sale of chiron diagnostics to bayer  chiron granted to chiron diagnostics rights under certain chiron patents  including patents relating to hiv and hepatitis c virus 
in exchange for these rights  chiron diagnostics paid to chiron a license fee of million which is refundable in decreasing amounts over a period of three years 
in  chiron recognized revenues of million which represents the portion of the million payment which became non refundable during the company anticipates recognizing the remaining revenue over a period of three years as follows million in  million in  and million in license fee revenues in january  chiron recognized million of revenues from a license fee related to an exclusive collaboration to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize therapeutic and prophylactic products for the treatment of hepatitis c in humans 
in august  chiron recognized a million license fee under an agreement related to certain technologies used in human vaccine products  including hepatitis b vaccine 
chiron will receive future royalties related to this agreement and recognized million of such royalties in other in  chiron recognized million of royalty and license fee revenues due to the acquisition and consolidation of chiron behring in the second quarter of in addition  royalties earned on schering ag s european sales of betaferon r interferon beta b increased million in as compared with royalties earned in due to continued market expansion 
the increase in royalty and license fee revenues in as compared with is primarily due to i an increase of million related to royalties earned on schering ag s european sales of betaferon r  which sales began in the second quarter of  and ii an increase of million from royalties received from merck co  inc for sales of hepatitis b recombinant vaccines 
other revenues in  and  chiron recognized other revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
the company s other revenues may fluctuate due to the nature of the revenues recognized and the timing of events giving rise to these revenues 
there can be no guarantee that the company will be successful in obtaining additional revenues or that other revenues will not decline 
significant fluctuations in other revenues from year to year are discussed below 
commission revenues in  other revenues included million of commission revenues generated by chiron behring  whose operations were consolidated with those of the company beginning in the second quarter of these revenues consist of commissions received on sales made by chiron behring of pasteur merieux merck s hepatitis b product and of centeon pharma gmbh s immunoglobulines products 
informatics technology in connection with the sale of chiron diagnostics to bayer  chiron recognized net revenues of million in exchange for granting bayer a license to use  reproduce and sell certain technology developed by chiron s informatics business 
the company does not anticipate future revenues from this technology  if any  to be commensurate with that achieved in aredia r pamidronate disodium for injection from through april  chiron promoted aredia r on behalf of novartis 
in april  this arrangement was terminated 
in connection with this arrangement  chiron recognized other revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
costs and expenses gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net product sales was  and  in  and  respectively 
although gross profit as a percentage of net product sales remained relatively constant with that in  the company s gross profit percentage was impacted by i a reduction in cost of sales of million due to a change in estimated property tax accruals created in prior periods  and ii an unfavorable mix of vaccine products which  beginning in the second quarter of  includes low margin products manufactured and sold by chiron behring 
in  improvements in gross profit as compared with primarily related to the mix of products sold  which reflects the company s first sales of pdgf 
the increase in gross profit percentage was partially offset  however  by charges recorded in related to inventory reserves and temporarily idled manufacturing facilities in italy 
the company s gross profit percentages may fluctuate significantly in future periods as the company s product mix continues to evolve 
research and development in  and  chiron recognized research and development expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the company s research and development expenses may fluctuate from year to year depending upon the level of clinical trial related activities 
in  the increase in research and development spending as compared with was primarily related to several of the company s projects entering into later stage clinical development 
in addition  included in research and development expense in was million of expense generated by chiron behring  which was acquired and consolidated during the second quarter of these increases were partially offset by decreased spending related to myotrophin r rhigf i or mecasermin 
recombinant dna origin 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the fda s approval of this product refer to item business 
in  the company incurred an aggregate increase of million in research and development expenses  as compared with  related to collaborative agreements regarding myotrophin r and certain genetic targets for the treatment of cancer 
in addition  in  the company incurred increased spending related to genomics and gene therapies research as compared with these increases in research and development expenses in were partially offset by decreased spending related to tissue factor pathway inhibitor tfpi which was in a phase clinical trial in other operating expenses in  and  chiron recognized selling  general and administrative sg a expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in sg a expenses in as compared with is primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of chiron behring  which contributed million to sg a expenses in as circumstances dictate  the company reviews the carrying amount of its manufacturing facilities by comparing the facilities projected undiscounted net cash flows against their respective carrying values 
in  the company recognized a million impairment loss to record the puerto rico facility and related machinery and equipment assets at their individual estimated fair market values  determined on the basis of independent appraisals 
there can be no assurances that future impairment losses will not be incurred as the company continues to assess its operational efficiencies 
during  chiron incurred net restructuring and reorganization charges of million related to i the integration of the company s worldwide vaccines operations  ii the closure of the puerto rico and st 
louis  missouri facilities  and iii the company s ongoing rationalization of its us business operations 
the restructuring and reorganization charges consisted of million of employee related costs to eliminate positions in sales  marketing and other administrative  manufacturing and research and development functions and million of facility related costs 
these charges were partially offset by a benefit of million due to a revised estimate of property and other tax related accruals recorded in in connection with the idling of the puerto rico facility 
the company anticipates that it will record additional restructuring and reorganization liabilities in future periods as it continues to create a simpler  more efficient operating structure for the organization 
the liabilities related to the restructuring and reorganization expenses are expected to be substantially settled within one year of accruing the related charges 
non operating income and expense in august  chiron completed the sale of its manufacturing facility in st 
louis  missouri  resulting in a gain on sale of assets of million 
in addition  in june  the company sold its fill and finishing facility in puerto rico  resulting in a gain of million 
in  and  chiron recognized interest expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared with is primarily due to the repayment of million on the company s lines of credit in january the borrowings were outstanding under the company s us credit facilities and were repaid with a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of chiron vision 
other income  net  consists primarily of investment income on the company s cash and investment balances and other non operating gains and losses 
in  and  chiron recognized interest income of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest income in as compared with is primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances attributable to the net cash proceeds received from the sale of chiron vision in the first quarter of and chiron diagnostics in the fourth quarter of in connection with its research and development collaborations  the company may invest in equity securities of its collaborative partners 
the price of these securities is subject to significant volatility 
in  and  chiron recognized a loss attributable to the other than temporary impairment of certain of these equity securities of million  million and million  respectively

the sale resulted in a net gain of million 
in  chiron sold its interest in a generic cancer chemotherapeutics business to ben venue laboratories  inc for million in cash  resulting in a gain of million 
in  the annual tax provision was of pretax income from continuing operations  excluding restructuring and reorganization charges  a financial reporting gain on sale of the puerto rico facility  and million of financial reporting income recognized in due to a change in estimated property tax accruals 
the reported effective tax rate for was of pretax income from continuing operations  including the impact of certain prepaid income subject to tax in the current year million  the tax effect of the reversal of certain accruals and the tax loss on the sale of the puerto rico facility million and the recognition of additional domestic deferred tax benefits million 
the company has utilized substantially all of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes as a result of the sales of chiron vision and chiron diagnostics 
the actual annual effective tax rate was  exclusive of the impact of the impairment loss which did not create a corresponding income tax benefit 
the increase in the effective tax rate of in as compared with  as adjusted above  is primarily due to the tax effect of certain prepaid income  partially offset by a higher proportion of non us income subject to tax at lower rates and additional recognition of deferred tax assets 
in  the provision for income taxes consisted primarily of foreign taxes related to the company s vaccines operations and us alternative minimum taxes 
new accounting standard in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in accordance with sfas  an entity is required to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of sfas will have on its results of operations and financial position and anticipates that it will implement sfas during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources chiron s capital requirements have generally been funded from operations  cash and investments on hand  debt borrowings  issuance of common stock and off balance sheet financing 
chiron s cash and investments in marketable debt securities  which totaled billion at december   are invested in a diversified portfolio of investment grade financial instruments  including money market instruments  corporate notes and bonds  government or government agency securities  and other debt securities 
by policy  the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited  however  these investments are generally not collateralized and primarily mature within three years

borrowing arrangements under a revolving  committed  unsecured credit agreement with a major financial institution  chiron can borrow up to million in the us this credit facility is guaranteed by novartis and provides various borrowing rate options  as defined in the agreement 
this credit facility matures in february there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility at december  the company had an additional credit agreement which expired unused in march chiron also has credit facilities outside the us which allow for total borrowings of million 
under these credit facilities  million of borrowings were outstanding at december  leases chiron leases laboratory  office and manufacturing facilities  land and equipment under noncancelable operating leases  which expire through future minimum lease payments are estimated to be approximately million in the aggregate  excluding a residual value guarantee of million due upon termination of an operating lease in as of december   novartis had guaranteed million of the company s operating lease commitments refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other commitments effective july   chiron and international business machines corporation ibm entered into a ten year information technology services agreement under which ibm will provide chiron with a full range of information services 
chiron can terminate this agreement beginning july   subject to certain termination charges 
if chiron does not terminate this agreement prior to its expiration  payments to ibm are expected to be approximately million in the aggregate 
through july   chiron s payments to ibm will total million 
payments to ibm are subject to adjustment depending upon the level of services and infrastructure equipment provided by ibm 
in future periods  the company expects to incur substantial capital spending 
at december   the company had various firm purchase commitments totaling approximately million 
contingent liabilities  both individually and in the aggregate  were insignificant at december  market risk management the company s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and fair value of equity securities held 
the company attempts to limit its exposure to some or all of these market risks through the use of various financial instruments 
these activities are discussed in further detail in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
year chiron is dependent on a number of computer systems and applications to conduct its business 
in the past  many computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to identify the relevant year 
these programs may not be able to distinguish between st and th century dates for example  may be read as the year when the year is intended 
this could result in significant system failures or miscalculations 
accordingly  the company has developed a comprehensive risk based plan designed to make its computer hardware and communication systems  software applications  and facilities and other non information technology related functions year compliant 
the plan covers three phases including i planning  ii assessment  and iii implementation 
the company has completed the planning and assessment phases  and expects to complete the implementation phase by mid with regard to the company s computer hardware and communication systems  chiron is in the process of implementing a technology refresh program which was developed in conjunction with ibm to update and standardize the company s computer hardware and communication systems 
as a result of this program  the company expects its computer hardware and communication systems to be year compliant by mid with regard to the company s software applications  the company has identified critical and non critical software applications and is in the process of updating and or developing software applications or certifying  in a test environment  that the software applications are year compliant 
a major component of remediating non compliant software applications is the design and implementation of an integrated information system 
the company anticipates that implementation of this integrated information system will be completed by mid with regard to the company s facilities and other non information technology related functions  including research  manufacturing  and inventory management practices  the company has performed an assessment and has begun remediation which is intended to make its facilities and other non information technology related functions year compliant by mid the company is currently utilizing both internal and external resources to prepare for the year the company believes that it should be able to substantially complete the implementation of critical internal aspects of its year plan prior to the commencement of the year however  even with substantial completion of internal remediation plans  the company s customers  suppliers and distributors also present risk of their own year compliance over which the company has no control 
the company has initiated communications with its critical suppliers and other external relationships to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to such parties failure to resolve their own year issues 
where practicable  the company is assessing and attempting to mitigate its risks with respect to the failure of these entities to be year compliant 
the effect  if any  on the company s results of operations from the failure of such parties to be year compliant  cannot be reasonably estimated 
the company is also implementing contingency plans to address any year issues that do arise 
as part of the company s contingency plans  the company is implementing specific plans for each critical system to ensure that the necessary precautions are taken to prevent and or address an unexpected system failure 
many of these contingency plans are already in place as they are based on existing plans that are required for the safe and proper operation of the company s business  including its research and manufacturing facilities 
the sec has requested that companies disclose the most likely worst case scenario that could occur as a result of the year the company believes that its most likely worst case scenario would be delays in product shipments due to a complete or partial manufacturing shutdown and or the delayed implementation of the company s integrated information system 
to address the manufacturing shutdown scenario  the company plans  among other things  to increase its inventory and re prioritize staff assignments  as needed  and does not believe that such a scenario is likely to occur 
with regard to the delayed implementation of the company s integrated information system  the company has established a contingency plan to remediate its non compliant business systems if scheduled milestones are not met 
to date  all significant milestones have been met  and as a result  the company has not implemented its contingency plan 
although the company is maintaining its ability to implement this contingency plan  based on the company s progress to date  and in consideration of the amount of resources allocated to this project  the company believes that implementation of its integrated information system will occur substantially as scheduled 
the company may incur significant costs in identifying and resolving year issues  including internal staffing costs as well as consulting and other expenses 
in addition  in certain instances  the appropriate course of action includes replacing or upgrading systems or equipment at a substantial cost to the company 
failure of the company to successfully complete its implementation of an integrated information system  which is a key element in the company s year remediation program  may have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company currently estimates that the costs associated with preparing for the year will approximate million 
the costs associated with the technology refresh program and the integrated information system are not included in the above estimates as year compliance is incidental to the operational benefits expected to be derived from these programs 
costs incurred through december  have been funded through operations and approximate million 
the company anticipates that most of its year costs will be incurred during the first half of these costs are anticipated to be funded with cash on hand and cash generated through operations 
euro conversion on january   eleven european union member countries established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the euro is currently traded on currency exchanges and can be used in business transactions 
the company s financial systems are euro ready as of december  however  the company is still in the process of evaluating the effect  if any  of the euro on the company s product pricing and gross profit percentages 
factors that may affect future results as a biotechnology company  chiron is engaged in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business 
the forward looking statements contained in this report and in other periodic reports  press releases and other statements issued by the company from time to time reflect management s current beliefs and expectations concerning objectives  plans  strategies  future performance and other future events 
the following discussion highlights some of the factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  that could cause actual results to differ 
promising technologies ultimately may not prove successful the company focuses its research and development activities on areas in which it has particular strengths  and on technologies which appear promising 
these technologies are on the cutting edge of modern science 
as a result  the outcome of any research or development program is highly uncertain 
only a very small fraction of such programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates 
product candidates which initially appear promising often fail to yield successful products 
in many cases  preclinical or clinical studies will show that a product candidate is not efficacious that is  it does not have the intended therapeutic effect  or that it raises safety concerns or has other side effects which outweigh the intended benefit 
success in preclinical or early clinical trials which generally focus on safety issues may not translate into success in large scale clinical trials which are designed to show efficacy  often for reasons that are not fully understood 
and even after a product is approved and launched  general usage or post marketing studies may identify safety or other previously unknown problems with the product which may result in regulatory approvals being suspended  limited to narrow indications or revoked or which otherwise prevent successful commercialization 
regulatory approvals the company is required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in order to market most of its products 
generally  these approvals are on a product by product and country by country basis and  in the case of therapeutic products  a separate approval is required for each therapeutic indication 
see item  business government regulation 
product candidates which appear promising based on early  and even large scale  clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval 
the results of clinical trials often are susceptible to varying interpretations which may delay  limit or prevent approval or result in the need for post marketing studies 
manufacturing most of the company s products are biologics 
manufacturing biologic products is complex 
unlike chemical pharmaceuticals  a biologic product generally cannot be sufficiently characterized in terms of its physical and chemical properties to rely on assaying of the finished product alone to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner 
accordingly  it is essential to be able to both validate and control the manufacturing process that is  to show that the process works  and that the product is made strictly and consistently in compliance with that process 
slight deviations in the manufacturing process may result in unacceptable changes in the products which may result in lot failures 
manufacturing processes which are used to produce the smaller quantities of material needed for research and development purposes may not be successfully scaled up to allow production of commercial quantities at reasonable cost or at all 
all of these difficulties are compounded when dealing with novel biologic products which require novel manufacturing processes 
accordingly  manufacturing is subject to extensive government regulation 
even minor changes in the manufacturing process require regulatory approval which  in turn  may require further clinical studies 
patents held by third parties may delay or prevent commercialization third parties  including competitors  have patents and patent applications in the united states and other significant markets that may be useful or necessary for the manufacture  use or sale of certain of the company s products and products in development 
it is likely that third parties will obtain other such patents in the future 
certain of these patents may be sufficiently broad to prevent or delay chiron from manufacturing or marketing products important to the company s current and future business 
the scope  validity and enforceability of such patents  if granted  the extent to which chiron may wish or need to obtain licenses to such patents  and the cost and availability of such licenses cannot be accurately predicted 
if chiron does not obtain such licenses  products may be withdrawn from the market or delays could be encountered in market introduction while an attempt is made to design around such patents 
alternatively  chiron could find that the development  manufacture or sale of such products is foreclosed 
chiron could also incur substantial costs in challenging the validity and scope of such patents 
product acceptance the company may experience difficulties in launching new products  many of which are novel products based on technologies which are unfamiliar to the healthcare community 
there can be no assurance that such products will be accepted by healthcare providers and patients 
in addition  government agencies as well as private organizations involved in healthcare from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients 
such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential  and may adversely affect the usage of the company s products directly for example  by recommending a decreased dosage of the company s product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy or indirectly for example  by recommending a competitive product over the company s product 
competition chiron operates in a highly competitive environment  and the competition is expected to increase 
competitors include large pharmaceutical  chemical and blood testing companies  as well as biotechnology companies 
some of these competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical and blood testing companies  have greater resources than the company 
accordingly  even if the company is successful in launching a product  it may find that a competitive product dominates the market for any number of reasons  including the possibility that the competitor may have launched its product first  the competitor may have greater marketing capabilities  or the competitive product may have therapeutic or other advantages 
the technologies applied by the company and its competitors are rapidly evolving  and new developments frequently result in price competition and product obsolescence 
chiron s patents may not prevent competition or generate revenues chiron seeks to obtain patents on its inventions 
without the protection of patents  competitors may be able to use the company s inventions to manufacture and market competing products without being required to undertake the lengthy and expensive development efforts made by chiron and without having to pay royalties or otherwise compensate chiron for the use of the invention 
there can be no assurance that patents and patent applications owned or licensed to chiron will provide substantial protection 
important legal questions remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the united states and other important markets 
it is not known how many of the company s pending patent applications will be granted  nor the effective coverage of those that are granted 
in the united states and other important markets  the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or the enforceable scope of its claims 
the company has engaged in significant litigation to determine the scope and validity of certain of its patents  and expects to continue to do so in the future 
even if the company is successful in obtaining and defending patents  there can be no assurance that these patents will provide substantial protection 
the length of time necessary to successfully resolve patent litigation may allow infringers to gain significant market advantage 
third parties may be able to design around the patents and develop competitive products that do not use the inventions covered by the patents 
many countries  including certain countries in europe  have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties for example  the third party s product is needed to meet a threat to public health or safety in that country  or the patent owner has failed to work the invention in that country  or the third party has patented improvements 
and most countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  the patent owner may be limited to monetary relief and may be unable to enjoin infringement  which could materially diminish the value of the patent 
availability of reimbursement  government and other pressures on pricing in the united states and other significant markets  sales of the company s products may be affected by the availability of reimbursement from the government or other third parties  such as insurance companies 
it is difficult to predict the reimbursement status of newly approved  novel biotechnology products 
and current reimbursement policies for existing products may change 
in certain foreign markets  governments have issued regulations relating to the pricing and profitability of pharmaceutical companies 
there have been proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level to implement such controls 
the growth of managed care in the united states also has placed pressure on the pricing of healthcare products 
these pressures can be expected to continue 
costs associated with refocusing and expanding the business the company is refocusing its efforts on its core businesses and also is focused on improving operational efficiencies 
in addition  management expects to grow the business in areas in which the company can be most competitive  either through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions of products or companies 
in connection with these efforts  the company may incur significant charges  costs and expenses which could impact the company s profitability  including impairment losses  restructuring charges  the write off of in process technology  transaction related expenses  costs associated with integrating new businesses  and the cost of amortizing goodwill and other intangibles 
other new products and sources of revenue many products in the company s current pipeline are in relatively early stages of research or development 
the company s ability to grow earnings in the near to medium term may depend  in part  on its ability to initiate and maintain other revenue generating relationships with third parties  such as licenses to certain of the company s technologies  and on its ability to identify and successfully acquire rights to later stage products from third parties 
there can be no assurance that such other sources of revenue will be established 
interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in  the company sold certain businesses for cash  including its in vitro clinical diagnostics and ophthalmic surgical products businesses  and as a result has significant cash balances and short term investments 
the company s financial results therefore are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations in the united states 
in addition  the company sells products in many countries throughout the world  and its financial results could be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
collaboration partners an important part of the company s research and development effort is undertaken in collaborations with third parties 
as circumstances change  the company and its corporate partner may develop conflicting priorities or other conflicts of interest 
the company may experience significant delays and incur significant expenses in resolving these conflicts and may not be able to resolve these matters on acceptable terms 
even without conflicts of interest  the parties may differ in their views as to how best to realize the value associated with a current product or a product in development 
in some cases  the corporate partner may have responsibility for formulating and implementing key strategic or operational plans 
decisions by corporate partners on key clinical  regulatory  marketing including pricing  inventory management and other issues may prevent successful commercialization of the product or otherwise impact the company s profitability 
stock price volatility the price of the company s stock  like that of other biotechnology companies  is subject to significant volatility 
the stock price may be affected by any number of events  both internal and external to the company 
these include  without limitation  results of clinical trials conducted by the company or by its competitors  announcements by the company or its competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by the company against third parties to enforce its patents and claims filed by third parties against the company relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners  corporate restructuring by the company  licensing activities by the company  and the acquisition or sale by the company of products  products in development  or businesses 
in connection with its research and development collaborations  from time to time the company invests in equity securities of its corporate partners 
the price of these securities also is subject to significant volatility  and may be affected by  among other things  the types of events which affect the company s stock 
changes in the market price of these securities may impact the company s profitability 
tax the company is taxable principally in the united states  germany  italy and the netherlands 
all of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate tax rates and other tax laws which could increase the company s tax provision in the future 
the company has negotiated a number of rulings regarding income and other taxes which are subject to periodic review and renewal 
if such rulings are not renewed or are substantially modified  taxes payable in particular jurisdictions could increase 
while the company believes that all material tax liabilities are properly reflected in its balance sheet  the company is presently under audit in several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that chiron will prevail in all cases in the event the taxing authorities disagree with its interpretations of the tax law 
in addition  the company has assumed liabilities for all income taxes incurred prior to the sales of its former subsidiaries  chiron vision corporation subject to certain limitations and chiron diagnostics corporation 
future levels of research and development spending  capital investment and export sales will impact the company s entitlement to related tax credits and benefits which have the effect of lowering its effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a significant portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign countries exposing the company to the effects of changes in foreign currency rates 
to manage foreign currency exchange risks  chiron enters into forward foreign currency contracts forwards and cross currency interest rate swaps swaps and purchases foreign currency option contracts options 
chiron does not use any of these derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the total notional amount of these derivative financial instruments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the company uses forwards to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies transaction exposures 
typically  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
chiron s objective is to minimize the transaction gains and losses recorded in current earnings that result from remeasuring foreign denominated assets and liabilities based on exchange rate fluctuations 
the company s transaction exposures are primarily denominated in major european currencies 
at december   these exposures amounted to million and were offset by forwards with a notional amount of million 
based on exposures as of december   a adverse movement against the company s portfolio of transaction exposures and hedge contracts would result in a loss of approximately million 
a movement in the value of the dollar versus the company s portfolio of transaction exposures has occurred in one of the last twelve quarters 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses from continuing operations  including the impact of hedging  were not significant in  or in addition  chiron also hedges certain anticipated exposures 
the company s primary anticipated exposures are related to intercompany inventory purchases by subsidiaries with functional currencies denominated in major european currencies 
the company attempts to hedge approximately of anticipated currency exposures by purchasing quarterly put options 
to limit hedging costs  the company generally purchases out of the money options 
as a result  chiron effectively does not purchase insurance for the first to of the exchange rate risk 
the total notional amount of the options at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the options outstanding at december  expire quarterly over a six month period  and provide protection against decreases in the value of the euro beyond per euro 
the fair market value of option contracts outstanding at december  was million 
the risk associated with these hedging instruments is limited to their fair market value 
the company has entered into a series of swaps to modify the interest and or currency characteristics of certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
the objective of the swaps entered into by the company is to fix the interest and currency rate exposures associated with the company s wholly owned german subsidiary 
the exposures are denominated in deutsche marks 
the notional amounts of the company s swaps at december  and were million and million  respectively 
if the deutsche mark strengthened or weakened by  the value of the underlying exposure would increase or decrease  respectively  by million 
after considering the impact of hedging with swaps  the net increase or decrease from such currency rate fluctuation would be reduced to million 
a movement in the value of the deutsche mark versus the us dollar has occurred in of the last years 
the fair market value of the swaps is million as of december  currency fluctuations in the value of the german subsidiary s assets and liabilities  as well as changes in the value of related swaps  are reflected as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
interest rate risk the company has exposure to changes in interest rates in both its investment portfolio and certain floating rate liabilities and lease commitments 
the company maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
the company also has short term debt obligations with interest rates tied to libor 
chiron s investment portfolio amounted to approximately billion at december  as of that date  the company also had million of floating rate debt tied to libor 
the company has a natural hedge against this exposure as a result of its portfolio holdings in floating rate fixed income securities tied to libor 
the analysis below focuses on the impact of changes in interest rates to chiron  and is based on a net unhedged portfolio balance of billion 
the analysis assumes an immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points and examines the impact to chiron over the next twelve months 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points results in higher interest income over the month period  partially offset by an immediate decline in the market value of securities held 
the net impact of this scenario is an estimated increase in total return to the portfolio of million over the month period 
similarly  a basis point decrease results in a decrease in total return to the portfolio of million 
the impact on reported earnings will be greater given that unrealized changes in the value of the portfolio are reported in other comprehensive income or loss 
chiron currently does not hedge these exposures 
the effect of these changes in interest rates on the company s portfolio  as measured over a month period  are mitigated by the relatively short duration of chiron s portfolio 
a basis point movement in the federal funds rate has occurred in of the last years  a basis point movement has occurred in of the last years  and a basis point movement has occurred in of the last years 
equity securities risk the company has exposure to equity price risk because of its investments in equity securities 
typically  the company obtains these securities through its collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
other than temporary losses are recorded against earnings in the same period the loss was deemed to have occurred 
the company does not currently hedge this exposure and there can be no assurance that other than temporary losses will not have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company recorded charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively  to write down certain available for sale equity securities for which the decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary 
changes in share prices or in the volatility of share prices affect the value of chiron s equity portfolio 
as of december   if the market price of chiron s equity investments decreased by  the market value of the equity portfolio would decrease by million 
counterparty risk chiron manages the risk of counterparty default on its derivative financial instruments through the use of credit standards  counterparty diversification and monitoring of counterparty financial condition 
all derivative financial instruments are executed with financial institutions with strong credit ratings  which minimizes risk of loss due to nonpayment 
chiron has not experienced any losses due to counterparty default
