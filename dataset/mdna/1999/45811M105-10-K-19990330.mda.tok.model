sale and divestiture of patient service and provider segment in december  the company announced its plans to exit and divest its outpatient provider behavioral health group practice operations 
the company entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of the outpatient behavioral practice business the sale  except for practices located in the western region of the united states which the company has sold or shut down 
the sale was completed effective may  and resulted in the divestiture by the company of substantially all the assets and business of the company s outpatient behavioral health practices 
as of december   the outpatient behavioral health practice business accounted for approximately eighty four percent of the assets of the company before the impact of the write down of assets and the impact of the restructuring charges  and for the year ended december   approximately eighty three percent of the company s net revenues 
as a result of the sale  the company is significantly smaller in terms of revenues and assets 
managed behavioral healthcare prior to  the company was not a direct provider of behavioral managed healthcare services 
during  the company acquired the integra managed behavioral healthcare company which at the time was principally a regional provider of employee assistance programs 
subsequent to the acquisition of integra  the company continued to invest in additional systems and management infrastructure and began actively seeking full risk capitation arrangements with health plans and other managed care organizations

segment reporting statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 was adopted by the company for this standard requires disclosure of segment information on the same basis used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
the company s operating segments are organized by product line 
for purposes of sfas no 
 these have been aggregated into two segments managed care and patient service and provider see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for a financial presentation of the company s segments 
as noted above and further explained in notes and of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company has exited all business lines except for managed behavioral healthcare 
the strategic decision to exit the patient service and provider segment was made by the company s board of directors in december and was substantially completed during segment information for the patient service and provider business unit in reflects the results of operations of these practices essentially through the date of the sale to psychpartners in may the company has no remaining patient service and provider businesses in operation at december  the company s continuing managed behavioral healthcare segment provides managed behavioral healthcare services through full and shared risk arrangements with employers  health plans and managed care organizations 
the company s revenues are primarily generated through capitated contracts 
revenues are generated entirely in the united states 
approximately of this segment s revenues were generated by seven customers 
the company believes this concentration of revenue over a small customer base is fairly consistent with industry trends 
results of operations the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all wholly owned and beneficially owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions  including management fees  have been eliminated 
with regards to the patient service and provider business  because of corporate practice of medicine laws in certain states in which the company operated  the company did not own the professional corporations which operated the professional and clinical aspects of the behavioral health provider operations in those states  but instead had the contractual right to designate  in its sole discretion and at any time  the licensed professional who is the owner of the capital stock of the professional corporation at a nominal cost nominee arrangements 
in addition  the company entered into exclusive long term management services agreements management services agreements with the professional corporations 
through the management services agreements  the company had exclusive authority over decision making relating to all major ongoing operations of the underlying professional corporations with the exception of the professional aspects of the practice of psychiatry  psychology and other professional behavioral healthcare services as required by certain state laws 
under the management services agreements  the company established annual operating and capital budgets for the professional corporations and compensation guidelines for the clinical professionals 
the management services agreements generally had initial terms of ten years or greater 
the method of computing the management fees varied by contract 
management fees were based on either i billings of the affiliated practice less the amounts necessary to pay professional compensation and other professional expenses or ii a license fee per location  reimbursement of direct costs  reimbursement of marketing costs plus a markup  and a flat administrative fee or iii a percentage of gross receipts of the affiliated practice 
in all cases  these fees were meant to compensate the company for expenses incurred in providing covered services plus a profit 
these interests are unilaterally saleable and transferable by the company and fluctuated based upon the actual performance of the operations of the professional corporations 
through the nominee arrangements  the company had a significant long term financial interest in the affiliated practices and  therefore  according to emerging issues task force no 
application of fasb statement no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  and apb opinion no 
 business combinations  to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with contractual management arrangement  the company consolidated the results of the affiliated practices with those of the company 
because the company must present consolidated financial statements  net revenues are presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
with the sale and exit of the company s provider operations  the company has either transferred its rights under the management services agreements  or intends to terminate these relationships 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  operating results of the company dollars in thousands years ended december  net revenues patient service revenue    premium revenue    total net revenues    cost of revenues patient service costs    premium service costs    total cost of revenues    gross profit    selling and administrative expenses    provision for doubtful accounts    amortization of intangible assets and excess cost over fair value of net assets acquired   write down of assets  restructuring and other charges   income loss from operations   patient service and provider segment revenue revenue for the patient service and provider segment is reported when earned at the time of service at the estimated amounts to be realized through payments from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered 
third party reimbursement is initially billed at usual  customary and reasonable market rates 
aggregate billings are adjusted when recorded to reflect the estimated amounts realizable from third party payors based on the company s historical experience and contractual rates established with the payors 
patient service revenue represents billings of the company s operations other than its behavioral managed care segment 
as stated above  the company has exited all patient service and provider segment operations as of december  patient service revenue for decreased to  from  in this decrease is the result of the execution of the company s plan to sell or shut down all patient service and provider segment operations 
the sale of the eastern outpatient operations was completed on may  the remaining outpatient operations were essentially shut down or sold during the first quarter of patient service revenue for decreased to  from  in this decrease is primarily a result of the impact of operations which were discontinued or downsized in conjunction with the company s restructuring in after adjusting for the impact of these operations  base business revenues decreased approximately  primarily as a result of continued reimbursement pricing pressure from managed care and other third party payors and the disappointing operating results of selected western region outpatient practices 
managed behavioral healthcare segment revenue premium revenue for the managed behavioral healthcare segment is essentially comprised of the company s portfolio of agreements with health plans  managed care organizations and employers to provide inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services 
revenues are primarily generated through capitated managed behavioral health and employee assistance programs 
the fees are defined by contract and are primarily calculated on a fixed per member per month fee 
revenues under these contracts are recorded in the month for which the member is entitled to services 
generally  these membership contracts are on a one to three year basis subject to cancellation by either party without cause at any time with thirty to ninety days written notice 
this segment had approximately   and  covered lives at december   and  respectively 
the company estimates the cost of providing services under these agreements  including a reserve for services incurred  but not reported  based upon authorized services  past claim payment experience for member groups patient census data and other facts 
the company typically does not subcapitate the risk of providing services under these contracts  but arranges discounted fee for service rates with independent inpatient and outpatient behavioral health providers  which the company manages 
under capitated contracts  the company is responsible for ensuring appropriate access to care and bears the risk for utilization levels and pricing of the cost of services performed under these contracts 
the company believes the future revenues under these contracts will exceed the costs of services it will be required to provide under the terms of the contracts 
an underestimation in the utilization or price of services for these contracts could result in material losses to the company 
historically  integra has managed these capitated contracts profitably 
the company maintains no re insurance against the risk of loss under these contracts 
managed behavioral healthcare premium revenue for increased to  from  in this increase is primarily the result of new contracts for both capitated managed behavioral health services and employee assistance programs 
premium revenue for increased to  from  in approximately of this increase was the result of expansion of services provided under managed care contracts principally due to securing additional medicaid lives through a contract with a health maintenance organization in new york 
the remaining increase was a result of new contracts and increased enrollment in the company s employee assistance programs and third party clinical case management and claims adjudication services 
cost of revenues patient service and provider segment costs of revenues for decreased from  in to  this decrease is primarily the result of the sale and exit of this business line 
patient service costs for decreased to  from  in this decrease is primarily a result of the impact of provider operations which were discontinued or downsized in conjunction with the company s restructuring 
managed behavioral healthcare segment cost of revenues increased in to  from  in this increase is primarily a result of the new contracts which began coverage in cost of revenues for this segment increased in to  from  in this increase is primarily due to the increased enrollment in the company s capitated managed care contracts and new contracts started during selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of corporate office  regional management and centralized billing expenses 
selling and administrative expenses decreased to  in from  in as a result of the sale and exit of the outpatient provider operations and downsizing of the company s corporate and regional management offices 
selling and administrative expenses decreased to  in from  in  due to a combination of reduced administrative costs as a result of discontinued or downsized operations and the company s ongoing administrative cost containment initiatives 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts decreased to  in from  in this decrease is a result of the sale and exit of the outpatient provider operations 
the company s behavioral managed care segment has historically incurred minimal uncollectible accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts increased to  in from  in this increase is primarily attributable to increased allowances recorded for the western region outpatient operations in connection with the company s exit from these markets 
the provision for doubtful accounts is estimated based on an ongoing review of collectibility of the company s accounts receivable 
the company believes the provision for doubtful accounts and the associated allowance for doubtful accounts are adequate based on management s ongoing review of collectibility 
at december   the company s balance sheet allowance for doubtful accounts contained  in allowances associated with long term care billings and outpatient locations which the company has shut down 
see note in the accompanying notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded additional accounts receivable reserves of  and  in and  respectively  pertaining largely to the company s long term care business which the company exited in the amounts were included as a component of restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations see restructuring and other charges below 
including these amounts  the provision for doubtful accounts would have been of net revenues in both and amortization of intangible assets and excess cost over fair value of net assets acquired amortization of intangible assets and excess cost over fair value of net assets acquired decreased to in from  in this decrease is a result of the sale and exit of the outpatient operations in in light of the repositioning of the company as a managed behavioral healthcare company and continuing changes in the managed healthcare industry  the company changed its estimated useful life for the excess of cost over fair value of assets acquired from years to years in amortization of intangible assets and excess cost over fair value of net assets acquired increased to  in from  in write down of assets the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  which established accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets  certain identified intangible assets and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long lived assets and certain intangible assets to be disposed of 
in accordance with sfas  the company reviews the realizability of long lived assets  certain intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate recorded costs may not be recoverable 
the company also reviews the overall recoverability of goodwill based primarily on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if over the remaining useful life of such assets  the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and their estimated fair value 
in estimating future cash flows  the company uses a combination of recent operating results  financial forecasts and budgets  and management estimates and assumptions of factors such as growth and potential future changes when determining whether an asset is impaired  and in measuring assets that are impaired  the company groups assets by geographic region 
the geographic region is the level at which the company contracts with managed care payors  deploys administrative and clinical resources and consolidates back office operations 
in addition  patients and company providers often use clinic locations interchangeably within a geographic region 
upon signing a non binding memorandum of understanding mou with psychpartners in october  the company had an impairment indicator as the fair value of the company s assets included in the mou were less than their respective carrying values 
accordingly  the company performed undiscounted cash flow analyses 
in accordance with the company s policy and sfas  during  the company measured the carrying value of the related intangible assets against the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the continued use of these assets 
the analyses indicated full recovery of the related intangible assets prior to the expiration of their remaining estimated useful lives which were approximately years 
the company changed its strategic direction in december with respect to these assets and the board approved a plan to exit and dispose of the outpatient operations see sale and divestiture of outpatient business 
accordingly  in december  the company revised its cash flow analyses to reflect the cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets prior to their disposal as well as the proceeds expected to result from their disposal based upon the terms of the purchase agreement with psychpartners and recorded a charge of  to write down the carrying amounts of these businesses to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the sale was completed as of may  net revenues for all of the outpatient group practices were approximately   and  and recorded loss from operations of including an allocated amount of corporate overhead was approximately   and in  and  respectively  excluding the above write down of assets and restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges this charge is comprised of the following years ended december  restructuring charges   long term care and provider billing reserves   restructuring charges in december  the company recorded a provision for restructuring pertaining to the company s decision to divest the outpatient provider group practices operations which were not sold to psychpartners and to reorganize corporate office functions to reflect the exit from the outpatient business 
the writedown of assets included a goodwill impairment charge of  associated with the operations the company exited 
the remainder of the write down of assets consisted primarily of fixed assets related to the discontinued operations 
when the company reached the decision to exit the outpatient business  in accordance with its policy and sfas  the company measured the carrying value of the related assets against the estimated fair market value for these remaining operations less costs to dispose and recorded the above writedown 
contract termination costs pertain primarily to accrued costs for lease terminations  and storage of clinical records 
employee severance costs included the accumulation of benefits set forth in the company s severance policy which were paid to approximately of the company s employees who were terminated as a result of the restructuring plan 
the primary employee groups affected included clinical and administrative personnel at western region clinic locations and regional and corporate staff 
the company s restructuring plan was substantially completed in during  the company also completed execution of the restructuring plan which discontinued the company s long term care operations  exited and consolidated underperforming outpatient locations and reduced management and overhead costs 
under these plans  approximately of the company s employees were terminated and the company wrote off assets consisting primarily of goodwill in the amount of  and fixed assets related to the restructured operations 
during  the company completed the execution of the restructuring plan which reorganized certain long term care operations and reduced management and overhead costs 
the company completed the employee reduction program by terminating of the company s employees and also wrote off assets consisting primarily of goodwill in amount of  and fixed assets of  the following summarizes the company s restructuring activity restructure restructure amounts balance at amounts balance at restructure restructure utilized in december  utilized december  provision provision in write down of assets    contract termination      costs employee severance  costs long term care and provider billing reserves during  the company established a  reserve in connection with the notification by the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services oig and the department of justice doj that certain of the company s medicare part b and related co insurance billings previously submitted for services to medicare patients in long term care facilities in florida were being reviewed 
the company reached a tentative agreement to settle this civil matter for  in december accordingly  the company recorded an additional reserve of  at december  the company also reserved  against the suspended accounts receivable with the florida intermediary 
in october  the company executed a final settlement agreement with the oig and doj  which resolved all of the claims against the company relating to this matter 
the terms of this settlement included a repayment of approximately  in march  the company received notification that the medicare intermediary in california completed a post payment medical review of billings previously submitted and paid between and based on the results of their review  the intermediary has requested a refund of approximately  services were denied primarily on the basis of medical necessity and incomplete documentation 
the company has requested an administrative hearing to appeal the intermediary s decision 
at december   the company fully reserved the above amount 
in addition  the company has recorded a reserve of  for other potential exposures pertaining to provider billing and long term care services 
during  both the florida and california medicare part b intermediaries adopted new payment review procedures for behavioral health services performed in long term care facilities 
the company  both individually and in conjunction with coalitions of behavioral healthcare providers  requested additional training and guidance on the revised payment review standards 
the company believes it was unable to obtain adequate training and guidance on the new standards despite the fact the intermediaries were applying the new review standards to the claims submitted by the company 
as further described above  in the fourth quarter of the company elected to discontinue its long term care operations 
concurrent with the exit of long term care at december   the company established a  reserve for denied claims  potential refunds  and accounts receivable which the company believed were impaired as a result of the restructuring plan 
in april  the company received notice that the office of the attorney general of new york state the state  was conducting an audit of the new york medicaid billings of one of the outpatient provider operations with which it had an administrative services agreement 
the state is investigating whether the company may have any liability arising from the operation of  and relationship with  that provider 
in october  the company terminated its relationship with that provider 
in february  the company received a letter from the state indicating that this matter could be settled by the company by refunding all medicaid monies paid to the outpatient operation during the company s relationship with the practice 
payments received by this practice during this period were approximately  the company believes the state s proposed settlement amount is inconsistent with the company s involvement with this practice under the administrative services agreement and intends to continue aggressively pursuing a resolution of this matter with the state 
although management believes that established reserves for the above matters are sufficient  it is possible that the final resolution of these matters may exceed the established reserves by an amount which could be material to the company s results of operations 
due to the nature of these matters the company cannot predict when these matters will be resolved 
the company does not believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s overall financial condition  liquidity or operations 
of the total restructuring and other charges  approximately  related to amounts to be paid in cash 
the non cash portion of the charges related to the write off of certain assets  principally goodwill associated with western region outpatient operations and reserves established for long term care services for denied claims 
interest expense related party in order to provide for additional financing if the sale to psychpartners did not occur in  the company entered into an agreement with certain investment partnerships the investment partnerships  which are significant stockholders of the company and are managed by foster management company  an affiliated party  to obtain their commitment to guarantee an additional  of financing 
this additional financing amount represented the company s estimated additional cash needs during for contingent payments  seller notes and restructure related activities 
under the terms of the agreement  in return for their guarantee  the investment partnerships were to receive the following i a commitment fee of of the guaranteed amount  ii a draw down fee of on bank borrowings in excess of  iii an unused commitment fee of per annum  and iv warrants to purchase  shares of common stock of the company at a price of per share the integra warrant or  in the event the sale was not consummated  a transaction fee of  payable on april  with the sale completed  the cost to the company of this guarantee was  of which was paid in cash to the investment partnerships 
the remaining portion represents a non cash charge of approximately  which is the difference between the exercise price of the integra warrant and the fair market value of the underlying common stock of the company on the closing date of the sale to psychpartners 
these charges have been recorded as interest expense in the company s results of operations for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations was  in  compared to net cash provided by operations of  in this use of cash is primarily a result of the losses incurred in prior to the sale and shut down of the outpatient operations as well as the cash used for restructuring related payments 
cash and cash equivalents remained fairly consistent  increasing to  at december  from  at december in  the company used in cash for capital expenditures compared with  in in may  the company completed the sale of its eastern outpatient operations to psychpartners 
net proceeds from the sale were primarily used to repay bank debt  fund acquisition notes and contingent consideration  settle the florida medicare review and fund other restructuring costs see above 
at december   the company had a working capital deficit of  the deficit is primarily attributable to accrued liabilities of  which pertain to the company s sale and exit of the outpatient provider behavioral group practice business and reserves established for long term care and other provider billing matters 
although these amounts are classified as current due to their nature  the company does not expect that all of these amounts will require payments in the next year 
the remainder of the company s accrued liabilities are operating in nature 
the company has established a credit facility with pnc bank 
at december   borrowing availability under this credit facility was approximately  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
if necessary  the company will use its credit facility to fund working capital requirements 
as a result of the above  the company believes that the cash flow generated by the company s operations together with its existing cash and availability of additional borrowings under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements in the company s current ratio  working capital and debt to equity ratio are set forth below for the dates indicated december  december  current ratio 

working capital deficit   debt to equity 
inflation a significant portion of the company s operating expenses have been subject to inflationary increases  including clinical and administrative salaries and rent expense 
based on management s assessment  the company has historically been unable to substantially offset inflationary increases through price increases but believes the company has somewhat mitigated the effect by expanding services and increasing operating efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to offset future inflationary increases in expenses  if any  which would result in a dilutive impact on the company s future earnings 
new contract effective january   the company implemented coverage of a full risk capitated contract with a health plan covering approximately  members 
the company expects this contract will generate over  in annual revenues and will become the company s largest contract 
profitability under this contract will depend upon the company s ability to manage the utilization of services within the premiums received 
an underestimation in the expected utilization of services for this contract could result in a material loss to the company 
potential impact of year computer issues the year problem is primarily the result of two potential malfunctions that could have an impact on the company s systems and equipment 
the first problem arises due to computers being programmed to use two rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
the second problem arises in embedded chips where microchips and microcontrollers have been designed using two rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
certain of the company s computers  programs  and building infrastructure components eg alarm systems and hvac systems are date sensitive and may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company relies on information technology it systems and other systems and facilities such as telephones  building access control systems and heating and ventilation equipment embedded systems to conduct its business 
these systems are potentially vulnerable to year problems due to their use of date information 
the company also has business relationships with customers and health care providers and other critical vendors who are themselves reliant on it and embedded systems to conduct their businesses 
state of readiness 
the company s internal it systems are largely centralized and consist primarily of purchased software 
the company s it hardware infrastructure is built mainly around ibm pc compatible servers and desktop systems 
the company s it software primarily utilizes microsoft systems including sql server  windows nt  internet information server  exchange and office 
the company believes these systems are either compliant or  with soon to be released service packs from microsoft  will be compliant by september  the company s clinical and claims administration software has been certified by the vendor as being year compliant 
the company intends to complete testing of this system by june year remediation costs incurred in were approximately and are estimated at under in external relationship 
the company also faces the risk that one or more of its critical suppliers or customers external relationships will not be able to interact with the company due to the third party s inability to resolve its own year issues  including those associated with its own external relationships 
the company has been assessing its external relationships and risk rating each external relationship based upon the potential business impact  available alternatives and cost of substitution 
the company is attempting to determine the overall year readiness of its external relationships 
in the case of significant customers and mission critical suppliers such as banks  telecommunications providers and other utilities and it vendors  the company is engaged in discussions with the third parties and is attempting to obtain detailed information as to those parties year plans and state of readiness 
the company  however  does not have sufficient information at the current time to predict whether its external relationships will be year ready 
risks and contingency recovery planning 
if the company s year issues were unresolved  it is possible the company would not have the ability to accurately and timely authorize and process benefits and claims  accurately bill customers  assess claims exposure  determine liquidity requirements  report accurate data to management  stockholders  customers  regulators and others  and would be subject to business interruptions or shutdowns  financial losses  reputational harm  loss of significant customers  increased scrutiny by regulators and litigation related to year issues 
the company is attempting to limit the potential impact of the year by monitoring the progress of its own year project and those of its critical external relationships and by developing contingency recovery plans 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to resolve all of its year issues 
any critical unresolved year issues of the company or its external relationships  however  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company is developing contingency recovery plans aimed at maintaining the continuity of critical business functions before and after december  as part of that process  the company is developing manual work alternatives to automated processes which will be designed to maintain business continuity 
these manual alternatives presume  however  that basic infrastructure such as electrical power and telephone service  as well as purchased systems which are advertised to be year compliant by their manufacturers primarily it hardware and software will remain unaffected by the year problem
