rental payments relating to such properties will be adjusted when permanent financing is obtained to reflect the interest rates available at the time of the refinancing and the amortization of principal 
in december   properties previously financed through the lease facility with a total financed value of million were permanently financed through operating leases

the company initiated assessments in prior years to identify the work efforts required to assure that systems supporting the business successfully operate beyond the turn of the century 
the scope of this work effort encompasses information technology systems  systems utilizing embedded technology  such as microcontrollers  and the readiness of external third parties  such as suppliers and service providers 
financial and non financial information technology systems these systems encompass both application software and operating system software 
the company has completed its assessment  renovation  and validation of potential problem areas concerning application software 
implementation the final stage of application software based in the company s distribution centers and headquarters is substantially complete other than application programs required for operation of the sorter in the company s nashville distribution center 
these programs are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter unless significant unanticipated remedial action is required  in which case completion is expected in the fourth quarter 
implementation of application software based in the company s stores is currently more than complete  with completion expected by the end of the second quarter of the assessment of operating system software has been completed 
necessary upgrades of operating system software are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal embedded technology systems the company has completed its assessment of the potential risks associated with embedded technology systems  such as hvac  elevators and security systems at the company s stores  distribution centers  and headquarters 
this involved inventorying all equipment utilizing embedded technology by vendor and model  and contacting the necessary vendors with regards to the compliance status of each item 
services or equipment provided by non compliant vendors identified through the assessment process will be upgraded to compliant versions to the extent that the company cannot correct identified problem areas internally 
this step is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal suppliers and service providers the company relies on numerous third parties to provide merchandise and services 
as such  attention has been focused on compliance attainment efforts of vendors 
key parties have been contacted for clarification of their year plans and their compliance status 
merchandise or services provided by non compliant vendors identified through the assessment process will be evaluated for potential alternative arrangements 
such arrangements may include less reliance on electronic ordering or sourcing through alternative distribution channels to the extent that merchandise is available through such channels 
notwithstanding the substantive work efforts described above  the company could potentially experience disruptions to some aspects of its various activities and operations  including those resulting from non compliant systems utilized by unrelated third party business entities 
the company is in the process of developing business contingency plans in order to attempt to mitigate the extent of potential disruption to business operations 
the company anticipates that development of such contingency plans will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the company will continuously monitor the adequacy of its contingency plans throughout the remainder of fiscal costs of addressing the year issue have not been material to date and  based on preliminary information gathered to date from the company and its vendors  are not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  as interest on the company s borrowings is principally based on variable rates 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company primarily utilizes interest rate swaps and collars to achieve this objective  effectively converting a portion of its variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
libor is the rate upon which the company s variable rate debt is principally based 
if libor were to increase in as compared to the end of  the company s interest expense  after considering the effects of its interest rate swap and collar agreements  would increase million based on the company s outstanding debt as of january
