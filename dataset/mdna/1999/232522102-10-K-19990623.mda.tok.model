the information in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements relating to the company s revenues  expenses  margins  liquidity and capital needs 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in business factors affecting the company s business and prospects 
the following discussion is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
general the company develops  produces and markets kvm switch and extension products for use in the computer industry 
the company s kvm switch products provide multiple users  each with a separate kvm peripheral  with the capability to control over  pcs  thereby eliminating the need for individual kvm peripherals for the controlled pcs 
elimination of kvm peripherals can provide significant cost reduction lower initial investment and ongoing utility costs and space savings as well as more efficient technical support capabilities 
the company s kvm switch products allow users to control ibm compatible and macintosh pcs and many sun  hewlett packard  dec  ibm and silicon graphics workstations functioning either as stand alone systems or as file  communications or servers operating within a lan 
the company also has interfaces for its autoboot commander xptm xptm  which operate with models of ibm rs  hewlett packard  dec s alpha  and silicon graphic s indigo workstations 
the company s autoview commandertm  introduced in mid fiscal  utilizes a cost reduced architecture that continues to provide the architecture for mid range and entry level products 
the company introduced switchview r  a two and four port kvm switch product in mid fiscal  and is the company s first product designed to be mass marketed 
as a result of the acquisition of the polycon companies  the company obtained several mid range to high end switching solutions including the polycon s  a single user console switching hub  and the polycon xs  a multi user matrix console switching hub 
certain kvm switch products were certified by novell corporation for use with its network software netware r also  microsoft corporation certified certain kvm switch products for use with its windows nt and windows operating systems 
the company s kvm switch products are particularly useful in networking environments where multiple computers are dedicated as servers and in situations where multiple computers need to be controlled from one location to facilitate network management 
the company s family of kvm extension products allows users to separate the kvm peripherals up to feet from the pc 
in addition  certain kvm extension products allow multiple users shared access to the same pc from different kvm peripherals 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company introduced longviewtm  which allows the extension of kvm peripherals and multimedia functions up to feet using a single category cable 
kvm extension products are particularly useful in congested work areas or where working conditions may be hazardous to the function of the computer 
the company s remote access line of kvm extension products allows users to control servers from remote locations using a standard modem  the internet or a network connection  without the necessity of remote access hardware or software on the pcs or servers being accessed 
when used in conjunction with a kvm switch product  the company s remote access line of kvm extension products permits users to control attached pcs remotely 
the company evaluates its products and its customer needs on an ongoing basis to advance its competitive position in the marketplace 
as part of this process  the company seeks expansion not only through internal development  but through strategic acquisition and expansion efforts 
consistent with this philosophy  on february   the company acquired substantially all the assets  including the related intellectual property and patents  of fox  a privately held company that develops remote access technology for the control and operation of personal computers and file servers 
additionally  the company completed its acquisition of the polycon companies on december   discussed later herein 
the acquisition of the polycon companies included intellectual property that the company is integrating with its research and development resources worldwide to expand the company s high end console switching products for mid and large scale networks 
the acquisition of the polycon companies was consistent with the company s strategy to expand its operations in europe and immediately added new customer relationships and expanded distribution channels 
the company s net sales have increased in each fiscal year due primarily to increases in the number of units sold to both new and existing customers as well as sales to customers of the polycon companies 
the increases in annual net sales reflect the company s strategy of increasing unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products as well as increasingly enhanced generations of already accepted products with increased functionality which are price competitive as compared to prior generations of the company s products and to the products of competitors 
as a part of this strategy  the company seeks to be price competitive and to be the high quality provider of products in its markets 
this strategy has enabled the company to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers as well as to increase its market share by selling products to new customers 
the company has broadened its marketing strategy of expanding channels of distribution by increased penetration in the oem market and the worldwide catalog market 
in fiscal  the company announced its first products designed specifically for the oem market 
these products are intended to expand the company s share of sales in the oem marketplace 
during this same period  the company began shipping certain kvm switch products to a major worldwide catalog marketer under private label 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company also began distribution of its branded products with a major distributor 
these relationships have broadened the company s channels of distribution of its products and are expected to increase market share 
the company expanded its marketing strategy to include the retail channel of distribution with the introduction of switchview r  which targets the desktop market 
switchview r was designed to address the high volume sales channels and is the company s first product targeted to the mass market 
the company believes it is the only kvm switch product manufacturer offering products ranging from the entry level pc single user switch to multi user  multi platform switches and console switching solutions that can control thousands of computers in data centers and server farms 
the company contracts with third parties to provide completed subassemblies of its products 
the company outsources entire products turnkey for certain stable high volume products 
the company believes that outsourcing manufacturing generally enables the company to control product costs more effectively 
the company continually evaluates new product opportunities and engages in substantial research and product development efforts 
the company expenses all product research and development costs as incurred 
additionally  the company also incurs substantial expenses related to advertising  participation in trade shows and other sales promotions 
another important part of the company s strategy is to emphasize customer service and support 
the company offers a day money back guarantee for all of its products  a one year warranty on parts and allows additional rights of return to certain of its customers 
the company estimates and accrues a liability for sales and warranty returns 
the company also offers sales discounts to its customers based on the level of sales 
the company believes that increasing its international sales is an important element in the overall strategy of future revenue growth 
international sales comprised   and of the company s total sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
on february   the company acquired substantially all of the assets  including the related intellectual property and patents  of fox  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated january   between the company  fox and the shareholders of fox 
the company paid approximately million at closing and may pay an additional amount of up to million in future payments based on future sales of fox s products over a maximum period of five years 
the acquisition  which was funded from available cash  was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  costs allocated to research and development assets with alternative future uses were capitalized and the remaining million of purchased research and development were expensed as a one time charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal on november   the company announced a for stock split  effected as a stock dividend 
the additional shares were distributed to shareholders on december  on december   cybex international acquired the polycon companies  privately held companies located in steinhagen  germany  pursuant to the terms and conditions of a purchase and sale agreement dated december  between the company  cybex international  and edgar and stephanie elsner  for a combined purchase price of  including acquisition related expenditures 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  costs allocated to acquired research and development assets with alternative future uses have been capitalized  and the remaining  of acquired research and development costs have been expensed as a one time charge on december  cybex international funded the acquisition of the polycon companies from its available cash 
on july   the company formally established operations in shannon  ireland  through its newly formed subsidiary  cybex international 
subsequently  the company entered into a month to month lease with the shannon development authority for temporary startup facilities located within the shannon free trade zone 
the lease for the  square foot facility expired in may of when cybex international moved into its new  square foot operating lease facility  also located in the shannon free trade zone 
results of operations the following table presents selected financial information derived from the company s statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal years indicated years ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses purchased research and development expenses operating income other income income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the company operates predominantly in one industry the design  production  marketing  and selling of keyboard  video monitor and mouse switch  extension and remote access products 
the company s method of internal reporting is disaggregated operationally  however 
the two reportable segments  cybex us and cybex international  are evaluated based on gross profit  therefore selling  general and administrative costs  as well as research and development  interest income expense  provision for taxes  is reported on an entity wide basis only 
reference made to the information regarding operational distribution of the company s revenues and gross margin  and to the operational distribution of the company s identifiable assets  in note to the consolidated financial statements set forth on pages and of this annual report on form k 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal additionally sales for the reportable segment cybex us increased from million in fiscal to in fiscal  while sales for the reportable segment cybex international increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal overall  the increased sales resulted from increased sales of the company s kvm switch products and from additional revenues provided from the acquisition of the polycon companies at the end of the third quarter of fiscal sales of the kvm switch product family increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of the company s mid and high end kvm switch products  as well as the entry level kvm switch products 
the mid to high end product sales grew approximately from fiscal to fiscal  while the entry level product sales increased from fiscal to fiscal the switchview r product  introduced in mid fiscal  was a major contributor to the increase in the entry level product sales 
sales from the acquired polycon company s products accounted for approximately of the companies revenues in fiscal  up from approximately of revenues in fiscal the company s international sales volume sales to locations outside the u 
s continued to increase in fiscal  causing international sales as a percentage of net sales to increase to as compared to in fiscal international sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal european sales accounted for approximately million  or of international sales  and grew from fiscal to fiscal gross profit is affected by many factors product mix  discounts  price competition  new product introductions and start up costs  increasing material and labor costs  and the levels of outsourcing of manufacturing and assembly services 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit for the reportable segment cybex us increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  while the gross profit for cybex international increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to due to increased volume in newer products designed for margin retention while being discounted for volume distributions  cost reductions due to volume efficiencies and increased outsourcing  and design changes  all of which were offset somewhat by increases in warranty and inventory reserves 
the increase in reserves was the result of the company s evaluation of the composition of inventory and the increased level of sales to major distributors and oems 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal this increase in dollars spent reflects increased expenditures in administration  sales  customer support  channel development  and marketing activities required to support the company s expanded sales base 
the increase also reflects the added selling  general and administrative costs attributed to the polycon companies acquisition at the end of the third quarter of fiscal management anticipates that the amount of selling  general and administrative expense will continue to increase  however  the anticipated expanding sales volume should cause the expenses to remain relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
for fiscal  total costs for research and development  exclusive of a one time write off for purchased research and development expense  were million of net sales compared to million of net sales  exclusive of a one time write off for purchased research and development expense  in fiscal  representing a increase 
the company anticipates that expenses for research and development will continue to remain relatively constant as a percentage of sales 
in february  the company acquired fox for a combined purchase price of approximately million including acquisition related expenses 
fox has technology and products that include remote access and power control products solutions for management of pcs and servers 
fox s major development project was the development of a windows based remote access device that allows control of servers over ordinary telephone lines and the internet from a remote location key view ii tm 
the company obtained an outside valuation of fox and values were assigned to developed technology  in process research and development in process r d  employment and consulting agreements  and customer base 
the valuations of developed technology  in process r d and customer base were established using an income based approach 
the valuation of the employment and consulting agreements were valued using a cost based approach 
revenue estimates for the technology under development were based on discussions with management  existing product family revenues of both fox and the company  anticipated product development schedules  product sales cycles and estimated life of the technology 
revenues for the product under development were estimated to begin in fiscal and continue through fiscal  with the majority of the revenues related to in process technology occurring after fiscal projected expenses were based on historical selling  general and administrative expenses and maintenance research and development expenses of the company  as all aspects of key view ii tm will be managed by the company 
the resulting operating income was adjusted for income tax expense using the company s tax rate 
in addition  estimated required returns on beginning net working capital  fixed assets and employment and consulting agreement  along with a deduction for cash flow attributable to the customer base  were considered in the discounted cash flow analysis 
the risk adjusted discount rate applied to after tax cash flow was for completed technology and for in process technology  compared to an estimated weighted average cost of capital for fox of approximately as well 
the total value of in process r d was estimated to be approximately million 
all of the estimated in process research and development was attributable to the development of key view ii tm 
the development of key view ii tm was estimated to be complete and is expected to be completed on time and available to ship in june in december  the company acquired the polycon companies for a combined purchase price of million including acquisition related expenses 
the polycon companies had product lines that included high end console switching units as well as extension products 
the major development projects included fiber optics solution technology  console switch technology and digital switching technology 
other development projects include software management server technology  multi console multiplier  and the universal serial bus adapter technology 
the company obtained an outside valuation of the polycon companies and values were assigned to completed technology  in process r d  in process r d with alternative future uses and trade names 
the valuations of developed technology and in process r d were established using an income based approach 
revenue estimates for each product line under development were based on discussions with management  existing product family revenues  anticipated product development schedules  product sales cycles and estimated life of each of the technologies 
revenues on the products under development were estimated to begin in fiscal and continue through fiscal  with the majority of the revenues related to in process technology occurring after fiscal year projected expenses were based on historical selling  general and administrative expenses  and maintenance research and development expenses of the company as management believed it would be able to apply its general operating cost structure to the polycon operations 
the resulting operating income was adjusted for income tax expense using the company s tax rate and adjusted for required returns on supporting assets 
the risk adjusted discount rate applied to after tax cash flow was for completed technology and to for in process technology 
the total value of in process r d was estimated to be approximately million 
approximately of the estimated in process research and development were attributable to the console switch technology and the digital switching technology 
the development of the console switch technology was completed on time in fiscal and is currently available to ship in certain polycon products 
the development of the digital switching technology was expected to take a minimum of two years to complete 
the project is currently anticipated to complete in late fiscal or early fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income before write offs of million from the acquisition of fox in fiscal and million from the acquisition of the polycon companies in fiscal  each relating to purchased research and development expenses from the acquisitions  increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal interest and other income amounted to million of net sales  net  in fiscal compared to million of net sales in fiscal interest and other income includes realized gains on the sale of certain investments  interest income and expense and the accretion of us treasury bill discounts 
as a result of the factors discussed above  income  before the one time write offs related to the acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal  increased to million of net sales  after the write off in fiscal from million of net sales  after the write off in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal additionally sales for the reportable segment cybex us increased from million in fiscal to in fiscal  while sales for the reportable segment cybex international  which began shipping in late fiscal  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increased sales resulted from increased sales of the company s kvm switch products and from additional revenues provided from the acquisition of the polycon companies in december sales of kvm switch products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales of the company s mid and high end kvm switch products  as well as the entry level kvm switch products 
the mid to high end product sales grew approximately from fiscal to fiscal  while the entry level product sales increased from fiscal to fiscal the switchview r product  introduced in mid fiscal  was a major contributor to the increase in the entry level product sales 
sales from the acquired polycon companies products accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal the company s international sales volume continued to increase in fiscal  causing international sales as a percentage of net sales to increase to as compared to in fiscal international sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal european sales accounted for approximately million  or of international sales  and grew from fiscal to fiscal gross profit is affected by many factors product mix  discounts  price competition  new product introductions and start up costs  increasing material and labor costs and the levels of outsourcing of manufacturing and assembly services 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit for the reportable segment cybex us increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  while the gross profit for cybex international  which began shipping in late fiscal  increased over from 
million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company s gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained constant at due to increased volume in newer products designed for margin retention while being discounted for volume distributions  cost reductions due to volume efficiencies and increased outsourcing  and design changes  all of which were offset by increases in warranty and inventory reserves 
the increase in reserves was the result of the company s evaluation of the composition of inventory and the increased level of sales to major distributors and oems 
the company believes its exposure to these risks is adequately reserved 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal this difference reflects increased expenditures in administration  sales  customer support  channel development  and marketing activities required to support the company s expanded sales base  as well as amounts reserved for legal costs associated with the defense of a patent infringement claim see contingencies 
the increase also reflects the added selling  general and administrative costs attributable to cybex international and the newly acquired polycon companies for the fourth fiscal quarter 
management anticipates that the amount of selling  general and administrative expense will continue to increase  however  the anticipated expanding sales volume should cause the expenses to remain relatively constant as a percentage of net sales 
for fiscal  total costs for research and development  exclusive of the one time write off of purchased research and development expenses  were million of net sales compared to million of net sales in fiscal  representing a increase 
the company anticipates that expenses for research and development will continue to increase above the level in fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income before the one time write off of million of purchased research and development expenses related to the acquisition of the polycon companies  increased to million of net sales in fiscal  from million of net sales in fiscal interest and other income amounted to million of net sales  net  in fiscal compared to million of net sales in fiscal interest and other income includes realized gains on the sale of certain investments  interest income and expense  and the accretion of us treasury bill discounts 
as a result of the factors discussed above  income  before the one time write off related to the acquisition of the polycon companies  increased to million of net sales  after the write off in fiscal  from million of net sales in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company financed its operations primarily through cash flow from operations and cash reserves as needed 
as of march   the company and its subsidiaries had an available line of credit of million with no outstanding borrowings 
a short term note in the amount of million was outstanding on march  the company repaid the note during the first week of april the company s working capital position increased from  as of march   to  adjusted to include  and  of long term investments  respectively as of march  this increase in the company s working capital position was due primarily to the increased earnings during fiscal the increase was offset somewhat by the acquisition of fox  discussed above 
cash provided from operating activities increased from million to million for fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
this increase was caused primarily by an increase in net income 
the increase in net income is attributed to an increase in sales as well as lower charges related to purchased research and development expense 
additionally  increases in accounts receivable at a decreasing rate from fiscal to fiscal  attributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
these increases were offset somewhat by increases in inventory at a decreasing rate from fiscal to fiscal the fluctuation in the accounts receivable increase can be attributed to the timing of sales and more prompt collection of accounts receivable 
the increase in inventory is attributed to the overall anticipated demand for new and existing products 
the company expects to continue to increase the level of turnkey manufacturing of products as they mature and designs stabilize  thereby reducing the level of inventory relative to those products that the company must maintain 
capital expenditures totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal capital expenditures relating to the construction of the new corporate facility in huntsville  alabama  amounted to approximately million 
approximately  in capital expenditures related to the purchase of an enterprise resource planning system erp system for the huntsville and shannon  ireland facilities 
the remaining capital expenditures were used to purchase equipment for the company including cybex international 
in august  the company moved into its newly constructed corporate facility in hunstville  alabama  built on land purchased in fiscal the new facility contains approximately  square feet with space for future expansion 
the facility is designed to house the company s sales  marketing  research and development  manufacturing and administrative functions 
the construction of the facility cost approximately million 
the company believes that its current financial position and existing cash and investments along with earnings and amounts available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements over the next twelve months 
financial accounting developments in  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the adoption of these accounting standards did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
sfas requires the use of the management approach in identifying operating segments of the company 
under the management approach  operating segments of an enterprise are identified in a manner consistent with how the company makes operating decisions and assesses performance 
sfas no 
also requires disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect results of operations or financial position but did affect the disclosure of segment information 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires all derivatives to be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in such fair value are required to be recognized immediately in net income loss to the extent the derivatives are not effective as hedges 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and is effective for interim periods in the initial year of adoption 
year readiness disclosure the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
as part of a year project to evaluate and determine the areas of risk  as well as to provide assurance that the year problem is adequately addressed  the company has identified its year risk in four categories products  internal business software  internal non financial software and manufacturing equipment  and external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
products 
the company has completed the review of its products 
the review determined that substantially all our products contain no software or firmware that is date sensitive and will therefore not be affected by dates at the turn of the century 
the few products that contain date sensitive software or firmwave have been tested and are year compliant 
as a result  all current products are year compliant 
this phase of the year project is complete 
internal business software 
in efforts to increase efficiencies in all aspects of its business  the company purchased an enterprise resource planning system erp system which the software vendor has indicated is year compliant 
the total hardware  software and installation cost of the erp system was approximately  the company began implementation of the erp system during fiscal and was on line at the beginning of fiscal the company s financial systems are year compliant 
this phase of the year project is completed 
internal non financial software and manufacturing equipment 
the company is in the data gathering phase with regard to non financial software and manufacturing equipment and is currently gathering data to assess the impact of the year on its non financial systems with year compliance scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal the company recently moved into a newly constructed facility 
all systems  such as the heating and cooling system and the security system  of the new facility are year compliant 
all shop equipment and manufacturing equipment purchased for the facility are year compliant 
management anticipates the cost of year compliance on the older equipment will not be material to the company 
this phase of the year project is substantially complete 
external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
the company is in the process of identifying and contacting its critical suppliers  service providers and contractors to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
it is expected that full identification will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  the company intends to change suppliers  service providers or contractors to those who have demonstrated year readiness but cannot be assured that it will be successful in finding such alternative suppliers  service providers and contractors 
however  the company has multiple source vendors for a majority of its products  which minimizes the risk of an adverse affect on operations 
the company does not currently have any formal information concerning the year compliance status of its customers but has received indications that most of its customers are addressing year compliance issues 
in the event that any of the company s significant customers and suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance and the company is unable to replace them with new customers or alternate suppliers  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
this phase of the year project is substantially complete 
costs 
the total costs associated with becoming year compliant is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
the estimated total cost of the year project is approximately million 
the total amount expended on the project through march   was over million  of which  related to the purchase and installation of the erp system  which have been capitalized 
all remaining costs have been expensed as incurred 
the remaining amount related to replacement of non compliant software and hardware and related to costs associated with evaluating and communicating with significant customers and suppliers 
the estimated future cost of completing the year project is estimated to be approximately  approximately  relates to replacement of non compliant software and hardware and the remaining  relates to costs associated with evaluating and communicating with significant customers and suppliers 
funds for the erp system purchase and installation were included in the company s capital expenditure budget 
the remaining costs have been and will be funded by cash flows from operations and will be expensed as incurred 
contingency planning 
while the company believes its approach to year readiness is sound  it is possible that some business components are not identified in the inventory  or that the scanning or testing process does not result in analysis and remediation of all source code 
the company will assume a third party is not year ready if no survey response or an inadequate survey response is received 
the company s contingency plan will address alternative providers and processes to deal with business interruptions that may be caused by internal system or third party providers failure to be year ready to the extent it is possible 
risks 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party customers and suppliers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year readiness and compliance of its significant customers and suppliers 
the company believes that the successful implementation of its erp system and completion of the year project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
the estimates and conclusions contained in this section are forward looking statements  and are based on management s best estimates of future events 
risks to completing the plan include the availability of resources  the company s ability to discover and correct the potential year sensitive problems which could have a serious impact on specific facilities  and the ability of customers  suppliers  vendors  and service providers to bring their systems into year compliance 
contingencies the company has certain contingent liabilities resulting from litigation initiated by apex 
apex contended in a patent lawsuit filed in february against the company and others in the united states district court in seattle  washington  that the company has infringed patent no 
 by mutual agreement and stipulation of apex and the company  the patent lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice 
patent validity and ownership issues raised in connection with the district court lawsuit will now be heard before the united states patent and trademark office 
the parties jointly requested the district court to urge accelerated consideration of these issues by the united states patent and trademark office 
at the conclusion of the united states patent and trademark office proceeding  the lawsuit can be reinstated upon the request of either party 
after extensive review of the claims at issue  management does not believe any of its products are covered by any valid claim of apex s patent 
as a result  it is management s opinion that the probable resolution of such contingencies will not have a material adverse affect on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
the company has been involved from time to time in litigation in the normal course of its business 
in the opinion of management  the company is not aware of any other pending or threatened litigation matter that will have a material adverse affect on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the area of interest rate changes impacting the fair value of its investment securities 
the company s investment policy is to manage its investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the investment of available funds 
the company diversifies the investment portfolio by investing in a variety of highly rated investment grade securities and through the use of different investment managers 
the company s marketable securities portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value in the investment portfolio resulting from a hypothetical percent change in interest rates  which is not material at march  the company generally holds investments until maturity and carries the securities at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value
