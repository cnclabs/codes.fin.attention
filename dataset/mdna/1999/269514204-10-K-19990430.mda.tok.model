inflation inflation has had only a minor effect on the operations of the company and its internal and external sources of liquidity and working capital 
year matters the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing inaccuracies and disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is dependent on computer hardware  software  systems and processes it systems and non information technology systems such as telephones  clocks  scales  refrigeration controllers and other equipment which may contain embedded microprocessor technology non it systems 
these systems are used in several critical operating areas including store and distribution operations  product merchandising and procurement  inventory and labor management  and accounting and administrative systems 
the company has been engaged in a comprehensive project under the direction of the chief executive officer since june to upgrade or replace its it systems and convert from mainframe to client server technology 
addressing year matters is an integral part of this process 
the company has phased in a substantial number of computer systems and related programs over the past two years  including financial systems  merchandising  distribution  store ordering  time and attendance  and direct store delivery receiving 
the company is currently in the process of upgrading or replacing various systems  including payroll  human resources and personnel systems  store systems  purchasing and inventory control and warehouse and distribution systems 
the project will include testing all systems critical for day to day operations 
the company is requesting each of its hardware and software vendors for both the new systems that it has installed or expects to install  as well as any systems which it does not expect to replace  to certify that their systems are year compliant 
subsequent to year end  the company requested certification  and is tracking responses  from companies it has a significant business relationship with that their systems are year compliant 
in addition  the company is evaluating year issues related to non it systems 
the evaluation consists of developing an inventory of all such systems  testing and taking corrective action on all detected deficiencies 
the company believes that its efforts will result in year compliance 
however  if the company s new computer system fails with respect to the year issue  or if any applications or embedded chips critical to the company s operational processes are overlooked  there could be a material adverse impact on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
the company cannot guarantee that hardware and software vendors on whom it has relied will honor their obligations with respect to year compliance  or that other companies it has a business relationship with will achieve year compliance 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be converted timely  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
management believes that  should the company or any third party with whom the company has a significant business relationship have a year related systems failure  the most significant impact would likely be the inability to conduct operations due to a power failure  to deliver inventory in a timely fashion  to receive certain products from vendors  process payments or to process electronically customer sales at the store level 
the company is in the process of developing contingency plans to provide alternatives to enable the company s core business operations to continue in the event of a year failure in its systems or in the systems of other companies with which it has a relationship 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s contingency plans rely will be converted timely  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not also have a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
the company expects to complete the contingency plans during the calendar year 
the company has expended approximately million since june to upgrade or replace the majority of systems and convert them to client server technology  and expects to incur an additional million  for a total of million  to complete the remaining systems 
in addition  the company has entered into operating leases for equipment with a fair market value of million and has purchased equipment for million  and expects to purchase or lease additional equipment with a fair market value of million  for a total of million 
this includes both year upgrades or replacements and the replacement of systems that are inefficient and in need of replacement regardless of their year readiness 
the company expects to finalize the upgrade or replacement of all it systems  correct any detected deficiencies in non it systems and achieve year compliance by september safe harbor statements under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the other statements in this form k which are not historical facts are forward looking statements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks which are inherent in the company s financial instruments which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
although the company currently utilizes no derivative financial instruments which expose the company to significant market risk  the company is exposed to fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its long term debt borrowings 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt borrowings 
borrowings on the revolving credit facility do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because of the floating interest rate charged on such borrowings 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings 
the following describes information relating to the company s instruments which are subject to interest rate risk at january  dollars in millions description contract terms interest rate cost fair value senior notes due april  fixed
