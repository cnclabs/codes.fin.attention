the company undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the company in this report and in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties on the risks and factors that may affect the company s business 
over the past several years  larscom has expanded its business from the supply of single purpose t and ft wide area network customer premises equipment cpe to fortune corporations  to providing high speed network access platform solutions predominantly to nsps 
from through  larscom was engaged primarily in the development  marketing and support of t csu dsus and t diagnostic equipment 
in october  the company acquired t technologies inc tt  a broadband products company 
the first broadband products developed by larscom after the acquisition of tt were the access t  one of the first t dsus  and the mega t  the first multiple t inverse multiplexer 
since then  the company has invested significant resources in developing a suite of broadband capabilities for the orion platform 
in december  the company completed the acquisition of netedge systems inc netedge  further expanding its broadband product line 
sales related to the company s network systems products access t  edge  mega t and orion represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
a small number of customers  consisting of nsps and resellers  have accounted for a majority of the company s revenues in each of the past several years 
sales to the company s top two customers mciworldcom and ibm accounted for   and of revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to nsps as a group represented  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
sales to nsps and resellers are often difficult to forecast due to a relatively long sales cycle for new accounts and frequent acceleration or delays in order schedules  often with limited notice  from existing accounts 
the company has experienced fluctuations in both annual and quarterly revenues due to the timing of receipt of customer orders as well as decisions from time to time by major customers to cease marketing  purchasing and reselling the company s products 
since the company continues to have significant sales to a small number of customers  similar fluctuations in annual and quarterly revenues may occur in the future 
since most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times to a limited number of customers  the company s ability to predict revenues is limited 
in addition  introductions or announcements by the company or its competitors of new products and technologies can cause customers to defer purchases of the company s existing products 
in the event that anticipated orders from major customers fail to materialize  or delivery schedules are deferred or canceled as a result of the above factors or other unanticipated factors  the company s business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
for example  in  the company s operating results were materially adversely affected by reductions in orders from some of its largest customers 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected revenues and margins  but expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  if revenues are below expectations in any given period  the company s inability to adjust spending in the short term may exacerbate the adverse impact of a revenue shortfall on the company s operating results 
moreover  even though the company may experience revenue shortfalls in two or three consecutive quarters  it may decide not to reduce its expenses if it believes the shortfall is a temporary phenomenon 
on october   larscom announced a corporate restructuring plan designed to better align its expenses with anticipated revenues 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction of approximately 
expenses of  related to the restructuring were recorded in the fourth quarter of the company expects to experience losses in the first two quarters of if the company is not successful in achieving its revenue expectations  or if expenses are higher than expected  losses could continue beyond such periods 
on december   larscom entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization the agreement 
the agreement provided for the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with and into netedge systems inc a privately held designer and manufacturer of atm edge access equipment  headquartered in research triangle park  north carolina 
the merger was consummated on december  the total merger consideration paid by larscom consisted of  in cash  acquisition costs of  and the assumption of liabilities of  the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  on this basis  the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to various intangible assets  primarily consisting of in process research and development  current technology  trademarks and goodwill based on an independent third party valuation 
the company recorded a charge to earnings during of  for acquired in process research and development related to netedge 
the company sells its products primarily through a direct sales force and to a lesser extent through a variety of resellers  including oems  vars  systems integrators and distributors 
the company is seeking to develop alternative distribution channels  particularly for the digital access group products  but sales to distributors have been fairly limited to date 
sales outside the us have not been significant to date 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring other nonrecurring charges in process research and development charge related to acquisition total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased to  in from  in the primary cause of this decrease was a reduction in sales of digital access products to  in from  in as a result of lower demand from certain of the company s largest customers 
network systems sales increased to  in from  in primarily due to sales of the edge product line which were not included in the period 
the proportion of total revenue from sales of network systems group products could decline slightly in as compared to gross profit 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased to in from in the primary reason for this decrease was the establishment of significant additional inventory reserves  mainly for the edge product line 
other factors impacting gross profit included amortization of intangible assets  lower production volumes and higher manufacturing costs during additionally  average selling prices of network systems and digital access group products decreased relative to the prior year 
the decrease was offset somewhat by a greater proportion of revenue coming from sales of network systems group products  which typically have higher gross margins than digital access group products 
while gross profit margins in are expected to be higher than in  particularly due to the one time impact in of additional inventory reserves  gross margins are not expected to reach the levels achieved prior to this is due to lower average selling prices on the company s principal products as they continue to age 
in addition  the company is currently seeking to develop an indirect distribution channel which typically yields lower margins on sales than direct sales 
a number of additional factors could cause gross profits to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue  including changes in product mix  price discounts given and changes in production volume 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses increased to in from in the increase in research and development expenses was due to significantly higher expenses  as compared with  associated primarily with increased headcount due to the netedge acquisition 
the company believes that a continued commitment to research and development  particularly related to broadband products and emerging technologies will be required to respond to customer demand and to remain competitive 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in the increase in expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to additional personnel and related costs due to the netedge acquisition  amortization of goodwill prior to the write down and an increase in the reserve for doubtful accounts 
this was offset by lower commissions  associated with reduced revenues  and the release  during the second quarter of  of the unused reserve of  that had been established for potential claims related to two general services administration contracts 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
selling  general and administrative expenses include charges from axel johnson for legal  accounting  tax  treasury and administrative services of  and  in and  respectively 
restructuring 
in october  larscom announced a corporate restructuring designed to better align its expenses with anticipated revenues and to allow the company to focus on opportunities that offer the greatest potential for long term growth 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction of approximately 
total expenses related to the restructuring were  of which  was related to employee severance costs 
at december    was accrued and unpaid  primarily related to severance payments that are conditional 
other nonrecurring charges 
as a result of the review and refocus of the company s edge product family in october  the company reviewed the intangible assets associated with the netedge acquisition for impairment in accordance with sfas the review and refocus was precipitated by lower than anticipated revenues from the edge product family 
the company determined that the sum of the estimated future cash flows related to the edge products were less than the carrying amount of the purchased intangible assets 
the fair value of these intangible assets was determined by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows of those assets 
the company recognized an impairment loss of  to write down these intangible assets to fair value 
in process research and development 
during  the company incurred a charge of  for in process research and development as a result of the company s acquisition of netedge in december research and development projects underway at the date of the acquisition of netedge were classified into two different categories enhancements to the existing edge hardware platform and development of a new hardware platform 
the values of the in process research and development were determined based on the expected net discounted cash flows to be generated from the products under development at the date of acquisition 
a discount rate of was used to calculate discounted future cash flows which reflects the inherent risks of the research and development efforts 
the values attributed to the enhancements to the existing edge hardware platform and the development of a new hardware platform were  and  respectively  as of december  the most sensitive factor in determining the expected net discounted cash flows from these projects was revenues 
other income expense  net 
other income of  during includes  from the sale of the company s former headquarters by a partnership in which the company held a one third interest 
the remainder is primarily federal income tax exempt interest from the company s cash equivalents and short term investments 
net non operating income of  during principally represented federal income tax exempt interest from the company s cash equivalents and short term investments 
income taxes provision benefit 
the effective tax benefit rate of and for and  respectively  differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of state taxes which is partially offset by federal tax exempt interest income 
at december   the company had recorded deferred tax assets of  primarily relating to the future tax benefits of amortization of intangible assets and an in process research and development charge which are deductible ratably over the next years 
the remaining tax benefit relates to inventory reserves and accrued expenses 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  the company has not recorded any valuation allowance against those assets because management has determined that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized 
realization of these assets is primarily dependent on the ability of the company to generate taxable income in the future 
some of the factors that the company used to make this determination are the company has a strong earnings history  a significant portion of the deferred tax assets are deductible over fourteen years  tax losses can be carried forward for twenty years  a portion of the losses can be carried back to prior years and the company can switch its investments to taxable securities from non taxable securities 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if the company s estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased to  in from  in the growth in revenues reflected increased sales of the company s broadband products  particularly the orion  which were partially offset by a small decrease in sales of digital access products 
gross profit 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased to in from in this increase was primarily a result of changes in revenue mix to higher margin broadband products and to a lesser extent lower per unit material costs  offset by declining prices of digital access products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses increased to in from in primarily due to increased headcount working on both the broadband and digital access product lines 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to in from in the increase in absolute dollars was due primarily to additional personnel costs in the sales  marketing and administrative functions 
this was offset by lower commissions and amortization expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include a charge from axel johnson for legal  accounting  tax  treasury and administrative services 
for and  these charges were approximately  and  respectively 
in process research and development 
in process research and development represents charges incurred as a result of the company s acquisition of netedge in december see footnote of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other income expense  net 
net non operating income of  during principally represents federal income tax exempt interest from the company s cash equivalents and short term investments 
the expense during of  primarily represents interest charged on the  note payable to axel johnson  which was paid with the proceeds of the initial public offering 
income taxes provision benefit 
the effective tax benefit rate for of differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of state taxes 
the effective tax rate of for  differed from the federal statutory rate as a result of non deductible goodwill amortization and state taxes 
liquidity and capital resources since its acquisition by axel johnson in and until its initial public offering in december  the company met its operating and capital requirements primarily from cash flows from operations and advances from axel johnson 
on december   the company sold  shares of class a common stock at a price per share of in its initial public offering raising net proceeds of  in january  the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional  shares and the company received additional net proceeds of  the company s operating activities generated  in cash in the company s net loss and an increase in deferred tax assets were offset by non cash items such as depreciation  amortization and intangible asset write downs  as well as a net decrease in working capital 
capital expenditures in were  such expenditures consisted principally of the purchase of computers  software and test equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures to increase in the company has a revolving line of credit of  under a credit agreement with axel johnson the credit agreement 
the credit agreement expires in december the credit agreement contains various representations  covenants and events of default typical for financing a business of a similar size and nature 
upon an event of default any borrowings under the line of credit shall become payable in full 
to date the company has not found it necessary to utilize this line of credit 
in addition to such credit agreement  the company and axel johnson entered into an administrative service agreement and a tax sharing agreement for the purposes of defining the on going relationship between them 
see footnotes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  the company believes that working capital  together with the company s line of credit and funds generated from operations  will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s operating and capital requirements at least through there can  however  be no assurance that future events  such as the potential use of cash to fund any significant losses that the company might incur or acquisitions the company might undertake  will not require the company to seek additional capital and  if so required  that adequate capital will be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
the effects of inflation on the company s revenues and operating income have not been material to date 
certain factors affecting future operating results except for the historical statements contained herein  this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the actual results that the company achieves may differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties set forth under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  certain factors affecting future operating results and elsewhere in this form k 
the company undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the company in this report and in the company s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties on the risks and factors that may affect the company s business 
customer concentration 
the company believes that its relationships with large customers  particularly nsps and isps  will be critical to its future success 
a small number of customers have accounted for a majority of the company s revenues in each of the past several years 
during  and  two customers  mciworldcom and its subsidiaries and ibm global network  together accounted for  and of the company s revenues  respectively 
in december  at t announced its agreement to purchase the ibm global network from ibm 
this acquisition is expected to be consummated in the middle of had this purchase been in effect since january  sales to two customers  mciworldcom and its subsidiaries and at t would have accounted for  and of revenue in  and  respectively 
accordingly  the company s revenue is currently highly dependent on continued orders from two large customers 
none of the company s customers is contractually obligated to purchase any quantity of products in any particular period  and product sales to major customers have varied widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
there can be no assurance that the company s current customers will continue to place orders with the company  that orders from existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
loss of  or a material reduction in  orders from one or more of the company s major customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results  absence of significant backlog 
the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
a small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of the company s sales 
therefore  sales for a given quarter generally depend to a significant degree upon orders received from and product shipments to a limited number of customers 
sales to individual large customers are often related to the customer s specific equipment deployment projects  the timing of which are subject to change on limited notice 
the company has experienced both acceleration and slowdown in orders related to such projects  causing changes in the sales level of a given quarter relative to both the preceding and subsequent quarters 
since  sales to mciworldcom and its subsidiaries  ibm  at t and other current customers have occasionally varied by up to million from quarter to quarter 
reductions in orders from certain large customers contributed significantly to the company s lower revenues in the second  third and fourth quarters of as compared to the corresponding quarters of since most of the company s sales are in the form of large orders with short delivery times to a limited number of customers  the company s backlog and consequent ability to predict revenues will continue to be limited 
in addition  announcements by the company or its competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer  limit  or end purchases of the company s existing products 
in the event that the company were to lose one or more large customers  anticipated orders from major customers were to fail to materialize  or delivery schedules were to be deferred or canceled as a result of the above factors or other unanticipated factors  the company s business and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
while gross profit margins in are expected to be higher than in  particularly due to the one time impact in of additional inventory reserves  gross margins are not expected to reach the levels achieved prior to this is due to lower average selling prices on the company s principal products as they continue to age 
in addition the company is currently seeking to develop an indirect distribution channel which typically yields lower margins on sales than direct sales 
a number of additional factors could cause gross profits to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue  including changes in product mix  price discounts given  costs of components  manufacturing costs and production volume 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels and margins  but expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  if sales are below expectations in any given period  the company s inability to adjust spending in the short term may exacerbate the adverse impact of a revenue shortfall on the company s operating results 
moreover  even though the company may experience revenue shortfalls in two or three consecutive quarters  it may decide not to reduce its expenses if it believes the shortfall is a temporary phenomenon 
the company expects to experience losses in the first two quarters of if the company is not successful in achieving its revenue expectations  or if expenses are higher than expected  losses could continue beyond such periods 
results in any period could also be affected by changes in market demand  competitive market conditions  market acceptance of new or existing products  increasing sales channel development costs  the cost and availability of components  the mix of the company s customer base and sales channels  the mix of products sold  sales promotion activities by the company  the company s ability to expand its sales and marketing organization effectively  the company s ability to attract and retain key technical and managerial employees and general economic conditions 
because of all of the foregoing factors  the company s operating results in one or more future periods may be subject to significant fluctuations 
in the event these factors result in the company s financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  the price of the company s class a common stock could be materially adversely affected 
restructuring 
revenues in were much lower than expected 
on october   larscom announced a corporate restructuring plan designed to better align its expenses with anticipated revenues and to allow the company to focus on opportunities that offer the greatest potential for long term growth 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction of approximately 
expenses of  related to the restructuring were recorded in the fourth quarter of the company expects to experience losses in the first two quarters of if the company is not successful in achieving its revenue expectations  or if expenses are higher than expected  losses could continue beyond such periods 
the company is conducting a search for a new chief executive officer 
if the search cannot be completed within a relatively short period of time the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
development of alternative distribution channels 
the company is currently seeking to develop an indirect distribution channel for sales to domestic customers 
this channel will consist primarily of a small group of master distributors  such as tech data  and a number of authorized resellers 
sales through this channel will consist primarily of digital access products  particularly the wanmaker product  and to a lesser extent network systems group products 
sales to large nsps and isps will continue to be handled by the company s direct sales force 
as part of this strategy the company has appointed certain sales people to sign up resellers and assist them in their sales efforts 
there are a number of risks associated with the development of an indirect distribution channel 
these include a reduction in the company s ability to forecast sales  reduced average selling prices  management s inexperience in establishing and managing a distribution channel  potential reductions in customer satisfaction  loss of contact with users of the company s products and new methods of advertising and promoting the products which will result in additional expenses 
these  and other factors  could cause results of operations and financial condition to be materially adversely affected 
the company markets its products internationally through non exclusive distribution agreements with vars and systems integrators 
to date the use of a distribution channel outside the us has not been particularly successful 
to focus on sales to europe  the middle east and africa  the company has created a regional sales and service team  headquartered in the united kingdom 
the united kingdom team focuses on direct sales to large nsps while also supporting its distributors for sales to smaller customers 
dependence on recently introduced products and products under development 
the company s future operating results are highly dependent on continuing market acceptance of the company s newest products 
network systems product sales represented and of revenues during and  respectively 
while the proportion of network systems product sales to total revenues may vary from quarter to quarter it is expected to decline slightly during the whole of  as compared to  but increase in the longer term 
the company s future success will be largely dependent on the market success of recently introduced products and products that may be introduced in the future 
these include  for example  the wanmaker line of digital access products and the orion product line which have only recently been introduced 
there can be no assurance that such products will achieve widespread market acceptance 
in addition  the company has in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and such delays may occur in the future 
the company s potential inability to develop and introduce new products or versions in a timely manner  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  or to achieve timely and widespread market acceptance of its new products or releases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
year as the year approaches  the challenges associated with moving into a new millennium have become a critical business concern around the world 
larscom recognizes the importance of addressing this situation in a timely  proactive manner 
in early  the company established a year compliance program to ensure that the company s products and internal systems currently in use continue to function properly into the next century 
as such  the company has placed a high level of emphasis on preserving the integrity and continuity of the business processes and activities that are vitally necessary for the business to continue 
the company initially focused its compliance efforts on the evaluation of products sold to customers 
the company has committed the necessary resources to make the company s current product offerings year compliant and has completed the testing and remediation phases 
all of the company s current product offerings are year compliant 
in those cases where products not currently offered were found not to be in compliance  the information was communicated to the company s customers via written notification 
in most cases  an upgrade path has been provided to these customers so that compliance is attained 
larscom is in the process of reviewing and obtaining the required resources to move into the implementation phase for its internal infrastructure 
the company is in the process of upgrading its primary business system for year compliance 
larscom anticipates the implementation phase to be completed by june additionally  the company is assessing and implementing necessary changes for all areas of the company s business which could be impacted  these include manufacturing plant floor equipment  system test laboratories  engineering laboratories and the building infrastructure 
based on assessments completed to date and compliance plans in process  larscom does not expect that the year issue  including the cost of making its products and critical systems compliant  will have a material effect on its business operations or cash flow 
direct costs related to all year compliance testing and remediation are estimated to be approximately  over a two year period of which approximately  had been incurred at december  larscom is engaged in the process of evaluating the year readiness of suppliers 
if larscom determines that critical suppliers are not year ready  larscom will monitor their progress and take appropriate actions 
based on current progress and future plans  larscom believes that the year date change will not significantly affect larscom s ability to deliver products and services to its customers on a timely basis 
however there can be no assurances that the year date change will not have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company is in the process of creating contingency plans to safeguard against failures of the company s own products  suppliers and vendors and internal information systems related to the year issue 
dependence on component availability and key suppliers 
on time delivery of the company s products depends upon the availability of components and subsystems used in its products 
the company depends upon its suppliers to manufacture  assemble and deliver components in a timely and satisfactory manner 
the company obtains components and licenses certain embedded software from numerous single sources 
the company does not believe it would be able to develop alternative sources for certain key components used in its products 
in addition  while the company believes it would be able to develop alternative sources for most of the other components and software used in its products without incurring substantial additional costs  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to do so  if required 
any inability by the company s suppliers to meet the company s demand or any prolonged interruption in supply or a significant price increase of one or more components or software would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company generally does not have any long term contracts with such suppliers 
there can be no assurance that these suppliers will continue to be able and willing to meet the company s requirements 
at the end of  vendors of three integrated circuits ics notified the company regarding their intent to cease production 
larscom anticipates that it will continue to use these ics and therefore entered into purchase commitments of approximately  in the aggregate  representing between one and two years expected demand for these components 
the company will consider redesigning its products to replace those ics 
the company has attempted to take into account factors such as the ability to replace the particular ic with a similar part and the estimated life of the company s products in determining the quantities to purchase 
while the company believes that it will use all of the quantities it has agreed to purchase  there can be no assurance that its estimates are correct 
if the company s estimates are not correct and requirements for these ics are less than anticipated  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
rapid technological change 
the telecommunications equipment industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent new product introductions 
the rapid development of new technologies increases the risk that current or new competitors could develop products that would reduce the competitiveness of the company s products 
the company s success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to respond to changes in technology and customer requirements 
this will require the timely development and marketing of new products and enhancements on a cost effective basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing  introducing or managing the transition to new or enhanced products or that any such products will be responsive to technological changes or will gain market acceptance 
if the company were to be unsuccessful or to incur significant delays in developing and introducing such new products or enhancements  the company s business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
for example  the company is aware of a competing technology with network monitoring capabilities that can be used instead of the split t product that the company sells primarily to mciworldcom 
if mciworldcom s customers were to opt for the alternative technology as part of their services  the company s business and operating results would be materially adversely affected 
sources of additional finance 
the company has access  subject to certain conditions  to a  credit facility provided by axel johnson 
in december  this agreement was amended and the termination date of the facility was extended until december there can be no assurance that alternative sources of financing will be available upon the expiration of such facility in december  or that additional sources of funding will be available on terms favorable to the company if the company s borrowing requirements exceed the amount of the facility 
management of operations 
the recent downturn in the company s business and related restructuring have placed a significant strain on the company s personnel  management and other resources 
the company s future success depends on its ability to recruit and retain employees following the recent restructuring and the company s recent financial performance shortfalls 
to grow its business  the company must continue to attract  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  integrate new management and employees into its overall operations and continue to improve its operational  financial and management systems 
availability of qualified sales and technical personnel is limited  and competition for experienced sales and technical personnel in the telecommunications equipment industry is intense 
the company s failure to manage any expansion effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
control by axel johnson 
holders of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of class b common stock are entitled to four votes per share  subject to adjustment  to preserve the initial voting ratio 
axel johnson is the sole holder of the class b common stock 
as a result  axel johnson has sufficient voting power to control the direction and policies of the company  including mergers  the payment of dividends  consolidations  the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the company and the election of the board of directors of the company  and to prevent or cause a change in control of the company 
in addition  the authorized but unissued capital stock of the company includes  shares of preferred stock the preferred stock 
the board of directors is authorized to provide for the issuance of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the designations  preferences  powers and relative  participating  optional or other rights and restrictions thereof 
accordingly  the company may issue a series of preferred stock in the future that will have preference over both classes of the company s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up 
the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of the common stock or discourage or make difficult any attempt to obtain control of the company 
such control may have the effect of discouraging certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of the company  including transactions in which the holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
risks associated with entry into international markets 
the company has had minimal sales to international customers to date  and has little experience in international markets 
although the acquisition of netedge increased the exposure of the company to international markets to some extent  sales outside the us continue to account for less than of the company s revenues 
the conduct of business outside the us is subject to certain customary risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  currency fluctuations  expropriation and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  to sell its products internationally  the company must meet standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries  as well as recommendations of the international telecommunications union 
a delay in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  certification of its products in countries outside the us could deny or preclude the company s marketing and sales efforts in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards 
the market for the company s products is characterized by the need to comply with a significant number of communications regulations and standards  some of which are evolving as new technologies are deployed 
in the us  the company s products must comply with various regulations defined by the federal communications commission and standards established by underwriters laboratories  as well as industry standards established by various organizations 
as standards for services such as atm evolve  the company may be required to modify its existing products or develop and support new versions of its products 
the failure of the company s products to comply  or delays in compliance  with the various existing and evolving industry standards could delay introduction of the company s products  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
risks associated with potential acquisitions 
as part of its efforts to grow its business  the company reviews acquisition prospects that would potentially complement its existing product offerings  augment its market coverage  enhance its technological capabilities or offer growth opportunities 
the company acquired netedge in december  however  this acquisition has not been a success 
see restructuring above for details
