year the company s year project the project is addressing the issue of computer programs with date sensitive software that may be unable to distinguish between the year and the year failure to correct the year issue could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company believes it has identified the significant year internal issues and has developed a plan to resolve them 
the project continues to assess external customers and suppliers and their year compliance 
based on a recent third party assessment  it appears the company will be required to modify or replace insignificant portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  and mitigate the year issue 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company is in the process of identifying and prioritizing critical suppliers and customers  and communicating with them about their plans and progress in addressing the year issue 
therefore  based on presently available information  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be converted to address year issues in a timely manner  and that such companies failure to achieve year compliance would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to mitigate the year issue 
the project is planned to be completed by no later than the end of first quarter of the total cost associated with mitigating the year issue is not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
to date  the company has incurred and expensed approximately  related to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts in connection with  the project 
the total remaining cost of the project is estimated to be approximately  and will be expensed as incurred 
the costs of and the date on which the company plans to complete the project are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions and factors  including those of external sources 
therefore  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from current plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company is subject to interest rate risk on its investment portfolio which consists primarily of high quality us government securities  corporate bonds and eurodollar bonds with an average maturity of less than one year 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in what it believes are the safest and highest credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and there are limitations regarding average and individual duration of investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
at december   the company s total portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments  all of which had maturities within one year 
additionally  the company generally has the ability to hold fixed income investments to maturity 
therefore  the company does not expect its results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected due to a sudden change in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk the company s international sales and related royalties of dermabond are based on sales in foreign currencies  but payable in us dollars  and thus may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect demand for the company s products by increasing the price of the company s products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold
