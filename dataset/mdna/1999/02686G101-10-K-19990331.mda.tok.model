aim acquisition partners  lp the advisor  serves as the advisor to the partnership 
aim acquisition corporation aim acquisition is the general partner of the advisor and the limited partners include  but are not limited to  aim acquisition  the goldman sachs group  lp  broad  inc and criimi mae 
pursuant to the terms of certain amendments to the partnership agreement  the general partner is required to obtain the consent of the advisor prior to taking certain significant actions which affect the management and policies of the partnership 
effective september  and through june   a sub advisory agreement the sub advisory agreement existed whereby cri aim management  inc  an affiliate of cri  managed the partnership s portfolio 
in connection with the transaction in which criimi mae became a self administered real estate investment trust reit on june   an affiliate of criimi mae acquired the sub advisory agreement

as a debtor in possession  criimi mae will not be permitted to provide any available capital to the general partner without approval from the bankruptcy court 
this restriction or potential loss of the availability of a potential capital resource could adversely affect the general partner and the partnership  however  criimi mae has not historically represented a significant source of capital for the general partner or the partnership 
such bankruptcy filings could also result in the potential need to replace criimi mae management  inc as a provider of personnel and administrative services to the partnership 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year the year issue is a computer programming issue that may affect many electronic processing systems 
until relatively recently  in order to minimize the length of data fields  most date sensitive programs eliminated the first two digits of the year 
this issue could affect information technology it systems and date sensitive embedded technology that controls certain systems such as telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
leaving them unable to properly recognize or distinguish dates in the twentieth and twenty first centuries 
this treatment could result in significant miscalculations when processing critical date sensitive information relating to dates after december  the general partner is currently in the process of assessing and testing year compliance of its it systems  which include software systems to administer and manage mortgage assets  and for internal accounting purposes 
a majority of the it systems used by the partnership is licensed from third parties 
these third parties have either provided upgrades to existing systems or have indicated that their systems are year compliant 
the general partner has applied upgrades and has completed a substantial amount of compliance testing as of march  there can be no assurance  however  that the partnership s it systems will be year compliant by december  the year issue may also affect the partnership s date sensitive embedded technology  which controls systems such as the telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
the general partner does not believe that the cost to modify or replace such technology to make it year compliant will be material 
the failure of any such systems to be year compliant could be material to the partnership 
the potential impact of the year issue depends not only on the corrective measures the general partner has undertaken and will undertake  but also on the ways in which the year issue is addressed by third parties with whom the partnership directly interfaces or whose financial condition or operations are important to the partnership 
the partnership has initiated communications with third parties with which it directly interfaces to evaluate the risk of their failure to be year compliant and the extent to which the partnership may be vulnerable to such failure 
there can be no assurance that the systems of these third parties will be year compliant by december  the failure of these third parties to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the partnership 
the partnership believes that its greatest risk with respect to the year issue relates to failures by third parties to be year compliant 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition to risks posed by third parties with which the partnership interfaces directly  risks are created by third parties providing services to large segments of society 
the failure of third parties to be year compliant could  among other things  cause disruptions in the capital and real estate markets and borrower defaults on real estate loans and mortgage backed securities as well as the pools of mortgage loans underlying such securities 
the partnership believes that its greatest exposure to the year issue involves the loan servicing operations of an affiliate of the partnership that rely on computers to process and manage loans 
an affiliate of the partnership  cmslp  currently services approximately of the total loans in the aim partnerships 
cmslp has applied a vendor upgrade and has substantially completed compliance testing on the upgrade 
currently the partnership estimates the cost of system upgrades related to year issues to be immaterial 
although the general partner has substantially completed its compliance testing and remediation  it is also in the process of developing contingency plans for the risks of the failure of the partnership or third parties to be year compliant 
the general partner intends to complete contingency plans for the year issue by may  due to the inability to predict all of the potential problems that may arise from the year issue  there can be no assurance that all contingencies will be adequately addressed by such plans

coinsured fha insured certificates under the hud coinsurance program  both hud and the coinsurance lender are responsible for paying a portion of the insurance benefits if a mortgagor defaults and the sale of the development collateralizing the mortgage produces insufficient net proceeds to repay the mortgage obligation 
in such cases  the coinsurance lender will be liable to the partnership for the first part of such loss in an amount up to of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage as of the date foreclosure proceedings are instituted or the deed is acquired in lieu of foreclosure 
for any loss greater than of the outstanding principal balance  the responsibility for paying the insurance benefits will be borne on a pro rata basis  by hud and by the coinsurance lender 
while the partnership is due payment of all amounts owed under the mortgage  the coinsurance lender is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest to the partnership 
the coinsurance item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations 
in addition  hud s obligation for the payment of its share of the loss could be diminished under certain conditions  such as the lender not adequately pursuing regulatory violations of the borrower or the failure to comply with other terms of the mortgage 
however  the general partner is not aware of any conditions or actions that would result in hud diminishing its insurance coverage 
as of december  and  the partnership held investments in three coinsured fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages

due to deferred maintenance and tax deficiencies  the partnership does not expect cash flow to be realized from this property until the property is sold and claims are filed with hud for multifamily coinsurance benefits 
the general partner intends to continue to oversee the partnership s interest in this mortgage investment to ensure that patrician meets its coinsurance obligations 
the general partner s assessment of the realizability of the carrying value of the st 
charles place phase ii mortgage is based on the most recent information available  and to the extent these conditions change or additional information becomes available  the general partner s assessment may change
