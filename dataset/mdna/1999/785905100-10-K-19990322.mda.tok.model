year compliance state of readiness 
in  the company implemented a project the year project intended to ensure that hardware and software systems operated or licensed in the company s business  including systems provided to its travel agency subscribers and its outsourcing customers  are designed to operate and properly manage dates beyond december  year compliant 
the company has assessed i its over information technology applications and operating systems that will be utilized to process dates after december  it systems and ii its non information technology systems  including embedded technology  relating to security  elevator control  hvac and systems non it systems 
the year project consists of six phases i awareness  ii assessment  iii analysis  design and remediation  iv testing and validation  v quality assurance review to ensure consistency throughout the year project and vi creation of business continuity strategy  including contingency plans in the event of year failures 
in developing the company s proprietary software analysis  remediation and testing methodology for year compliance  it studied the best practices of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers and the british standards institution 
it systems 
the company has completed the first three phases of the year project for all of its it systems 
the company has completed the testing and validation phase and quality assurance review phase for of its it applications  including its computer reservations and flight operating system applications that perform such mission critical functions as passenger bookings  ticketing  passenger check in  aircraft weight and balance  flight planning and baggage and cargo processing 
as of february   approximately of the it applications including the computer reservations systems are already processing year dates correctly 
using dedicated testing environments and applying rigorous test standards  the company is actively testing its other it systems to determine if they are year compliant or further remediation is necessary 
the company estimates completing the testing and validation phase and quality assurance review phase for its remaining it systems by june  all software developed by the company and currently being marketed is year compliant 
the company has installed year compliant hardware and software at substantially all of its travel agency subscriber locations worldwide 
the company will continue upgrading certain hardware and software that support its it systems  which it estimates will be completed by june  non it systems 
the company has completed the first four phases of the year project and expects to complete the quality assurance review phase during the second quarter of for substantially all of its non it systems 
the company believes that its business  financial condition and results of operations would not be materially adversely affected  and that it has adequate contingency plans to ensure business continuity  if any of its non it systems are not year compliant 
accordingly  the company has primarily focused its year project efforts on its it systems 
third party services 
the company relies on third party providers for many services  such as telecommunications  utilities  data and credit card transaction processing 
in providing services to the company  those providers depend on their hardware and software systems and  in the case of telecommunications and data service providers  on interfaces with the company s it systems 
the company received responses from substantially all of its telecommunications and data service providers  other than providers of discretionary data services that would not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a majority of the responding providers assured the company that their software and hardware is year compliant or will be before june  to the extent practical  the company intends to replace third party telecommunications and data service providers that are not year compliant by june  the company s business is particularly dependent on its ability to transmit data on a worldwide basis through telecommunications networks 
for telecommunications network services  the company relies on third party service providers throughout the world  including at t  sita and mci worldcom 
many of those service providers rely on other communications service providers that are located in less developed countries and may have allocated limited resources to year compliance 
the failure of a segment of the telecommunications network could disrupt the company s ability to provide services to its customers 
depending on its severity  a disruption could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company does not expect the year issues it might encounter with third parties to be materially different from those encountered by other information technology companies  including the company s competitors 
costs of year project 
the company expects to incur significant hardware  software and labor costs  as well as consulting and other expenses  in its year project 
the company s total estimated cost of the project is approximately to million  of which approximately million  cumulatively  was incurred as of december  the total costs include approximately million for the installation of year compliant hardware and software at travel agency subscriber locations  approximately million for the company s software applications  approximately million related to the company s hardware and software infrastructure and approximately million for project management and other labor costs 
future costs of the year project will primarily result from the redeployment of information technology resources  although no significant internal it systems projects are being deferred to further the year project 
the remaining costs primarily relate to the ongoing upgrade of certain hardware and software that support the company s it systems  the analysis  testing and verification of the year readiness of third party service providers  and the refinement of the company s business continuity plans 
costs associated with the year project will be expensed as incurred and will be paid from operating cash flows 
risks of year non compliance 
the economy in general  and the travel and transportation industries in particular  may be adversely affected by risks associated with the year the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if it systems that it operates or licenses to third parties  or systems that are operated by other parties with which the company s it systems interface  are not year compliant in time 
there can be no assurance that these systems will continue to properly function and interface and will otherwise be year compliant 
management believes that its most likely year risks relate to the failure of third parties with whom it has material relationships  particularly telecommunications network providers  to be year compliant 
although the company is not aware of any threatened claims related to the year  the company may be subject to litigation arising from such claims and  depending on the outcome  such litigation could have a material adverse affect on the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s insurance coverage would be adequate to offset these and other business risks related to the year issue 
business continuity plans 
to the extent practical  the company is identifying the most likely year failures in an effort to develop and refine plans to continue its business in the event of failures of the company s or third parties systems to be year compliant 
these plans include performing certain processes manually  maintaining dedicated staff to be available at crucial dates to remedy unforeseen problems  installing defensive code to protect real time systems from improperly formatted date data supplied by third parties  repairing or obtaining replacement systems  and reducing or suspending certain non critical aspects of the company s services or operations 
because of the pervasiveness and complexity of the year issue  and in particular the uncertainty concerning the efforts and success of third parties to be year compliant  the company will continue to refine its contingency plans during new european currency in january  certain european countries established fixed conversion rates between their currencies and a new common currency unit called the euro 
the company conducts business in european countries 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro is between january  and june  in  the company implemented a project intended to ensure that hardware and software systems operated or licensed in the company s business  including systems provided to its travel agency subscribers and its outsourcing customers  were designed to properly handle the euro 
the company completed the project in the company estimates that the conversion to and use of the euro  including the total cost for the euro project  will not have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations 
outlook for the company expects continued profitability and revenue growth in revenues from the company s existing outsourcing customers  including us airways  american and canadian  are expected to be the same as or less than revenues because the company has completed year efforts for american and canadian and most of the migration services for us airways 
the company  however  expects strong revenue growth from outsourcing contracts signed in  from new contracts expected in and from software development and real time transaction processing services 
as a result  the company expects that the amount and proportion of revenues from information technology solutions activities to increase 
additionally  the company expects overall revenue growth from electronic travel distribution activities to be consistent with prior years 
the company anticipates a slight decline in domestic airline bookings in  however  the company expects to compensate for the decline with growth in international bookings  market share gains worldwide  price increases and revenues from new promotional and marketing products 
the company expects an improved operating margin in due to a reduction in expenses associated with the company s year compliance program because the project is nearing completion 
in addition  the company expects improved margins on the us airways contract as the conversion migration services will be completed in early and the contract will be moving to steady state 
the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in as a result of sales growth initiatives and increased administrative requirements to support the company s growth
