overview risk of continued losses the company designs  manufactures and markets specialty and general purpose medical imaging systems for the diagnosis and treatment of disease 
the company s newer products are directed towards medical specialties  such as diagnosing and treating breast cancer  heart disease and vascular disease  in which image guided  minimally invasive therapies are replacing open surgical procedures 
the company also designs and manufactures specialty x ray imaging components and subsystems for several leading medical product companies and sells general radiology systems for use in hospitals  clinics and physicians offices 
the company has experienced significant losses in four of the five years ended december  although the company was profitable in and for the first nine months of  significant losses have been incurred since that time 
significant factors giving rise to recent losses include excessive manufacturing capacity and related costs to manufacture  intense competition for certain of the company s products  declining margins and demand for oem products  and a general slowdown in capital expenditures by hospitals 
the company cannot predict when it will return to profitability  although it has taken significant steps to reduce costs and improve sales 
these include 
entering into a distribution partnership  in october  with ethicon endo surgery for the marketing and sale of mammotest breast biopsy systems  
entering into a strategic alliance with direct radigraphy corp  a subsidiary of sterling diagnostics  inc see the strategic alliances heading of the business section of this form k  
closure of the company s addison  illinois manufacturing facility  and 
other actions to reduce operating expenses and manufacturing costs 
improvement in the company s results of operations will depend on many factors  including 
demand for the company s products  
the availability of adequate financial resources  
the company s ability to maintain or increase gross margins  
the effectiveness of efforts to control manufacturing and other costs  
effective negotiation and implementation of distribution arrangements for mammotest and other products  
effective implementation of marketing and sales strategies in the united states and internationally  
maintenance or renewal of orders under oem agreements with favorable terms  and 
the development and introduction of new products that compete successfully 
the company believes that improved factory utilization is a key factor in returning to acceptable levels of profitability 
therefore  the company decided in the third quarter of to close its addison  illinois manufacturing facility and outsource or transfer addison production 
in january  the company fulfilled its remaining obligations for this facility by agreeing to a million lease buyout  completing the addison closure within the original million provision 
the company expects continued significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues  operating results and net income  depending on such factors as 
delays in development projects  
the timing of orders for large system products and products produced under oem contracts  and related manufacturing and shipment scheduling  
new product introductions or marketing initiatives by the company or its competitors  
the effects of managed healthcare on capital expenditures and reimbursement  
increases in marketing  research  and other costs in relation to sales  
regulatory clearance of new products  
the effect of general economic conditions of the company s markets  and 
the effects of seasonal patterns and other timing issues with respect to customer purchasing decisions 
because the timing of the occurrence of such factors is difficult to anticipate and many of the company s costs are fixed  the company may not be able to sufficiently reduce its costs in periods when its revenues are less than anticipated and may suffer unexpected losses or lower income in these periods 
in recent years  the company has attempted to expand its international sales and marketing efforts  which have resulted in losses from its international operations 
the company can expect to continue to incur losses until international revenues reach sufficient levels 
additionally  the company s exposure to foreign currency and other international business risk may increase as its international business grows 
the company attempts to minimize these risks by i generally requiring payments in us dollars  ii using letters of credit  and iii requiring advance deposits and through other means 
there can be no assurance  however  international sales efforts will be successful or that associated risks can be minimized 
international revenues declined substantially in and sales of the company s mammotest breast biopsy systems were lower in as compared to  but increased in beginning in the second half of  the company faced aggressive and successful competition within the surgical stereotactic core needle breast biopsy market from u 
s 
surgical 
the company s october marketing partnership with ethicon endo surgery was intended to more adequately address this market 
in december  following its acquisition by tyco corporation  u 
s 
surgical terminated its oem agreement with trex 
while long term competitive conditions may become more favorable to the company  it is uncertain whether the near term impact on mammotest sales will be favorable or unfavorable 
in late  the company entered into an alliance with direct radiographic corp  a subsidiary of sterling diagnostic imaging  inc  under which the company will develop specific digital radiographic systems  utilizing sterling s directray tm digital image detector technology 
six prototypes for the first product  a dedicated digital chest system  have been installed with encouraging results 
in january  the agfa gevaert group announced the acquisition of direct radiography s parent company 
the direct radiography is not included in this acquisition 
in order to continue product and market development  direct radiography must obtain alternative financial sponsorship 
there can be no assurance given  at this time  that such sponsorship can be obtained 
year update general the company uses software and related technologies in its products and in product development and manufacturing that may be impacted by the year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications use two digit date fields to designate a year 
as a result  date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to properly treat the year could cause systems to process critical financial and operational information incorrectly 
year project the company is in the process of evaluating its products  computer hardware  and operating software  and third party suppliers for possible year problems 
this project is organized as follows anticipated anticipated completion out of pocket area task status date cost i 
products current versions initial review complete documentation complete earlier versions develop evaluation testing program complete perform testing complete documentation complete develop remedial program  if necessary nd qtr ii 
primary business software upgrade to year compliant version complete under  perform testing complete provide user training complete update customized reporting features complete iii 
other software applications major payroll and engineering applications obtain certification of year compliance complete other applications evaluate and or obtain certifications rd qtr iv 
hardware networks confirm year compliance complete personal computers confirm year compliance complete replace or upgrade as necessary nd qtr under  v 
third party suppliers establish evaluation criteria complete survey suppliers nd qtr re source as necessary rd qtr no significant out of pockets incurred or expected to be incurred 
at this time  the company has not formulated contingency plans in the event that systems are not year compliant 
the need to develop such plans will be assessed following the completion of testing of its primary business software and upon receipt of information from critical third party suppliers regarding their year compliance 
costs the cost to be incurred in conjunction with the year project is expected to be less than  for anticipated upgrades to existing desk top personal computers and for the assistance of outside consultants in upgrading the company s primary business system 
this amount is not considered material to the company s financial position 
unanticipated problems could cause this amount to be exceeded  however  and no assurance can be given that  under such circumstances  the amount would not be material 
it is anticipated that most year project activities will be performed with internal resources 
consequently  year activities can be anticipated to continue to delay other projects  particularly in the area of new information systems development 
such delays are not  however  expected to materially impact the company s results of operations 
risks the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  normal business activities or operations 
there is inherent uncertainty regarding the year problem  in part resulting from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers 
therefore  the company is unable to predict with certainty whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem  in particular  with respect to the year compliance and readiness of its third party suppliers 
the company believes that the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be significantly reduced by the implementation of upgraded business systems and the completion of the year project as scheduled 
based on its assessment to date  the company believes that few of its current products will be affected by the year problem 
of those that may be affected  the only significant risk appears to be the possible inaccurate dating of patient records 
the remedial actions to correct dating problems that may occur appear to be either i 
the customer being able to reset the date on a one time basis to prevent future occurrences or ii 
implementation of modifications currently under development by the company or third party suppliers  which are expected to be finalized and released to customers by the end of the first quarter of the company is nearing completion of its evaluation of earlier versions of current products and may conclude that problems less easily addressed do exist 
if such problems are identified  disruption of customers operations could conceivably occur  potentially resulting in legal actions being taken against the company  even though year problems are not expressly covered by product warranties 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year update should be read in conjunction with the company s cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements elsewhere in this form k  which is provided under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s revolving line of credit is variable based on the prime rate and  is therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately million was outstanding with an interest rate of prime plus 
the line of credit is cancelable upon days notice by the lender and  should such cancellation occur  or the company s liquidity needs exceed amounts available under this line of credit  the interest rate applicable to replacement credit facilities might be significantly higher 
for example  if the interest rate on the company s line of credit had been twice the rates in effect for its year ended december   the company would have incurred additional interest expense of approximately  for the year  with an associated 
increase in the per share loss for that year 
the company attempts to manage its interest rate risk by monitoring interest rates which are available under other types of lending instruments and through other lenders but  at present  does not qualify for lending instruments which would not be more expensive that its current month to month lending arrangement 
therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates will be significant until such time as its operating results permit it greater access to other lenders and lending instruments on terms equivalent or superior to those available under its current lending agreement 
foreign currency risk the company has a wholly owned subsidiary in australia and a owned subsidiary in denmark which  in turn  owns subsidiaries in germany and france 
local assets and liabilities  principally intercompany debt to the parent company  are recorded in local currencies  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
these changes may positively or negatively affect the company s operating results 
as disclosed at note to notes to consolidated financial statements  revenues in foreign currency through all foreign subsidiaries constituted approximately of total revenues for the company 
the company therefore does not believe that foreseeable near term changes in exchange rates will have in a material effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company and has chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging instruments 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will prove to have been successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the applicable local currencies 
fda regulation the company is subject to periodic inspections by the food and drug administration  whose primary purpose is to audit the company s compliance with good manufacturing practices  which include testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
in march  the company s denver facility received a warning letter from the fda concerning documentation and other deficiencies 
the company rectified these deficiencies and resolved the matter with the fda later that year 
following an inspection concluded in december  the fda issued inspectional observations form and a warning letter regarding manufacturing practices at its denver facility 
the fda requested a written response to the warning letter regarding planned corrective actions and a favorable third party certification of the company s manufacturing and quality systems 
these actions were completed 
in october  following a periodic inspection  the fda issued a form regarding possible deficiencies in manufacturing  quality  and documentation practices 
the company has submitted its response to the form and is instituting corrective actions 
the recent issuance of another form increases the possibility that one or more of the sanctions described below could be imposed 
failure to satisfy fda requirements can result in the company s inability to receive awards of federal government contracts  to receive new marketing or export clearances for products manufactured at its denver facility  or fda enforcement actions including  among other things  product seizure  injunction  and or criminal or civil proceedings being initiated by the fda without further notice 
although the company strives to operate within the requirements imposed by the fda  there can be no assurance that these deficiencies can be corrected or that the company will be able to satisfy fda compliance concerns in the future 
these ongoing fda compliance reviews and or related delays in product clearances could have a material adverse effect on the company 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to revenues represented by certain data included in the company s statements of operations for the years ended december revenues cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development 
selling  marketing and service general and administra tive litigation loss restructuring provision total operating ex penses loss earnings from opera tions interest expense interest income other income  net loss before income taxes provision benefit for in come taxes net loss compared to revenues 
revenues increased from million in to million in the revenue increase was due to a increase in shipments of mammotest and other mammography products and a significant increase in service revenues  offset by declines in shipments of oem and general radiology products 
the increase in mammography product sales was  in significant part  due to the favorable effects of the company s marketing partnership with ethicon endo surgery 
see overview 
the decline in general radiology shipments was due to shipment delays caused by the transfer of production of general radiology products from the company s addison  illinois manufacturing facility  which is now closed 
the decline in oem shipments is  in part  due to the company s decision to de emphasize low margin oem business 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in this increase was due to the favorable effects of reducing fixed factory capacity costs  through the closure of the company s addison manufacturing facility  and to the shift in product mix to relatively higher margin mammography and service business  from relatively lower margin oem product sales 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  or of total revenues  in  as compared to million  or of total revenues  in the modest increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to costs associated with developing a digital general radiography system in conjunction with sterling

selling  marketing and service expenses 
selling  marketing and service expenses decreased to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of total revenues  selling  marketing and service expenses decreased from in to in the decrease in selling  marketing  and service expenses and the decrease as a percentage of total revenues are primarily due to planned reductions in marketing expenditures  as strategic marketing partners have assumed part of the cost of product marketing 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses equaled of total revenues in both and the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to higher legal expenses in as compared to  partly offset by cost savings associated with continued efforts to reduce operating expenses 
the increase in legal expenses is primarily due to preparations for the company s patent infringement lawsuit against lorad  which is expected to commence during see item  legal proceedings 
litigation loss 
the litigation loss of million  or of total revenue  is the result of the company s guarantee of work performed by a now bankrupt dealer in the united kingdom 
see item  legal proceedings 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in borrowings under the company s line of credit beginning in mid these borrowings were primarily used to fund increases in working capital 
see liquidity and capital resources 
net loss 
the net loss declined from million in to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of mammography product shipments and an increase in service revenues  both of which are relatively high margin  and the favorable effects of the addison factory closure on manufacturing costs  partially offset by the million write off of deferred tax assets 
compared to revenues 
revenues decreased from million in to million in the revenue decrease was principally due to a decline in shipments of oem products  as well as declines in sales of general radiology  mammography  and electrophysiology products 
the decline in mammography product sales was in part due to aggressive and successful competition within the surgical stereotactic core needle biopsy market from us surgical corporation 
in an effort to more adequately address this market  the company entered into a marketing partnership with ethicon endo surgery 
see overview 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in this decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable effects of reduced factory utilization and to significant one time manufacturing costs associated with the company s decision to close its addison  illinois manufacturing facility 
the company believes that such one time manufacturing costs were as much as million in the fourth quarter of  including about million of non cash inventory adjustments and million of plant rearrangement  labor inefficiencies  and other out of pocket cash expenses 
such costs do not include those included in the million restructuring charge recorded in  principally for lease obligations and employee severance costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  or of total revenues  in  as compared to million  or of total revenues  in the reduction in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to efforts to narrow the focus of engineering efforts and eliminate marginal engineering efforts  as well as efficiencies caused by the transfer of engineering activities from the company s addison  illinois manufacturing facility 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues was due to lower revenues in the company is maintaining its commitment to research and development as the key to its long term success  with the development of digital imaging products for mammography continuing to be a key focus of the company s research and development activities 
selling  marketing and service expenses 
selling  marketing and service expenses decreased to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of total revenues  selling  marketing and service increased to in from in the decrease in selling  marketing  and service expenses is primarily a result of decreased warranty  installation  and commissions expenses caused by lower revenues in  planned reductions in the scope of marketing activities  and efficiencies in service related activities caused by the transfer of such activities from the company s addison  illinois facility 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  marketing  and service expenses have increased due to the impact of fixed costs compared against lower total revenue 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses equaled and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the modest increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher legal expenses in as compared to  partly offset by cost savings associated with the closing of the company s addison facility 
the increase in legal expenses is primarily due to preparations for the company s patent infringement lawsuit against lorad  which is expected to commence during see item  legal proceedings 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the elimination of borrowings under the company s line of credit beginning in mid and extending throughout see liquidity and capital resources 
net loss 
the net loss increased from million in to million in the increased loss was primarily due to the unfavorable effects of the company s decision to close its addison  illinois manufacturing facility  which included a million restructuring charge  an estimated million of non cash inventory write offs  and about million of plant re arrangement and other out of pocket costs  as well as the effects of a significant decline in revenues  primarily due to a decline in shipments of oem and mammography products 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
the and rates reflect increases of million and million  respectively  in the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
these increases are due mainly to uncertainty relating to the realizability of net deferred tax assets due to the company s recent history of net operating losses 
at december   the company had valuation allowances of approximately million  reducing deferred tax assets to the realizability of net deferred tax assets is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income  and the company s estimate of realizable deferred tax assets may change in the near future 
no income tax provisions have been recognized for foreign tax jurisdictions and no income tax benefits have been recognized for subsidiary losses outside the domestic consolidated return because they are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company utilized million of cash flow in operations and million in investing activities  while generating million from financing activities  resulting in a million decrease in cash 
the cash flow utilized in operations was primarily due to an increase in working capital  offset by a modest favorable cash impact of the company s net loss before non cash expenses 
the increase in working capital consisted primarily of a million increase in inventories  a million increase in trade accounts receivable  and million of payments for restructuring costs 
the unfavorable effects on cash from changes in working capital were partially offset by a million increase in customer deposits and million of increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities  resulting in a million net unfavorable impact from changes in working capital 
this change was partially offset by the million net favorable impact of million of non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  the litigation loss contingency  non cash inventory adjustments  and the write off of deferred income tax assets included in the million net loss 
cash utilized in investing activities decreased from million in to million in  due in part to an increase in capital expenditures financed through capital lease arrangements 
cash generated from financing activities during primarily reflected million in borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit agreement  made to finance operating losses 
during  the company generated million of cash flow from operations  while utilizing million in investing and million in financing activities and million in other changes in cash  resulting in a million increase in cash 
the cash flow from operations was primarily due to a decrease in working capital  offset by the company s net loss before non cash expenses 
the decrease in working capital primarily consisted of a million reduction in inventories and million in net collections of trade accounts receivable 
these decreases  along with other working capital and other changes in net assets of million  positively impacted cash flow from operations 
this impact was partially offset by the net loss from operations before depreciation  amortization  non cash inventory adjustments  and the non cash restructuring charge of million and by million of severance and other facility closing costs charged against the restructuring reserve 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash utilized in investing activities decreased from million in to million in  due to an increase in capital expenditures financed through capital lease arrangements and a reduced level  in  of capital investments related to the development of full field digital mammography 
cash utilized in financing activities during reflected million in repayments of long term debt  offset by the proceeds from sales of common stock of million 
during  the company utilized million of cash flow in operations and million in investing activities  while generating million from financing activities  resulting in a million increase in cash 
the utilization of cash flow in operations was primarily due to an increase in working capital 
the increase in working capital consisted of a million investment in inventories and a million reduction in accounts payable 
these working capital increases  which reduced cash flow  were partially offset by million of net collections of trade accounts receivable and by net earnings before depreciation  amortization  and non cash inventory adjustments of million 
cash utilized in investing activities of million in was somewhat higher than in other recent years due to a reduction in capital expenditures financed through capital lease arrangements and capital investments related to the development of full field digital mammography 
cash generated from financing activities during reflected the company s june sale of  shares of common stock for million  net of related expenses  and the proceeds of other stock sales  offset by debt reductions  including repayments under the company s line of credit  totaling million 
on december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of million 
the company has a million revolving line of credit arrangement  subject to borrowing base restrictions 
due to the effects of these restrictions  which are based upon eligible receivables and inventory  only million of the line was available as of december   of which million was unused 
the agreement is secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventories  and fixed assets and may be called by the lender upon days notice 
the agreement is renewable monthly and such renewals are subject to a fee of  per month 
the borrowings under the agreement are subject to interest at one percent over the bank s prime rate of interest  or at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has experienced significant losses in four of the five years ended december  and has also had negative cash flows from operations in three of those five years  resulting in the depletion of substantially all of the company s cash 
further  subsequent to the end of  the company approached its maximum borrowing capacity  in part due to the lease buyout relating to its addison  illinois manufacturing facility see note to the consolidated financial statements  and may be similarly constrained later in as more fully described in note  the company s principal lender may withdraw the revolving credit facility at any time upon giving the company thirty days notice 
any such withdrawal  or any occurrence of the company s liquidity needs exceeding its available borrowing capacity  would have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company has taken action to reduce the level of operating losses and the fixed cash needs of the business  most notably the closure of the addison facility 
management believes the benefits of the addison closure and consolidation of operations in the denver facility will be seen in if the company were to need additional funds for operations  or if the current lender were to call the credit facility  management believes it could obtain financing at or above current levels from multiple lending sources  by securitizing accounts receivable  inventories  and other tangible assets 
the company has no present plans for capital expenditures in materially different from recent years 
recent developments on march   the company announced an agreement with general electric company  on behalf of ge medical systems  under which  or of the  shares of convertible preferred stock currently owned by ge medical systems will be exchanged for a non exclusive right to manufacture the tilt c system 
completion of the necessary technology transfer is required by mid april  the company expects to continue its manufacturing activity for ge medical systems through at least december  the original expiration date of the oem contract 
see also related discussion at item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters risks associated with shares eligible for future sale earlier in this report 
the transaction will result in revenue to the company of approximately million  before related expenses 
because the sale is being paid for by ce medical systems in shares of convertible preferred stock  there will be no cash effect on the company 
however  as a result of the attendant reduction in the number of outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock  the diluted book value of the company is expected to increase by approximately 
per share  or overall following the transaction
