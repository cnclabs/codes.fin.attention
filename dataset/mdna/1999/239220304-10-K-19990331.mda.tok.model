item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
all data in the tables are in thousands  except for percentages and per share data 
the company s principal line of business is an integrated systems solution provider of cleanrooms and cleanroom component systems for the semiconductor industry 
in recent years  the company has typically had one to three significant customers  each of which accounted for more than of the company s annual revenues  these customers do not necessarily remain significant in subsequent years 
the semiconductor industry has been historically cyclical in nature and continues to be adversely affected by the industry downturn that began in the latter part of capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers has always closely followed chip sales 
as chip sales increased from around billion per year in the late s to a peak of billion in  capital spending on equipment and facilities by the chip manufactures surged to billion from about billion during the same period of time 
as chip sales have declined over the past three years to about billion in  capital spending on new equipment and facilities plunged to less than billion in the company s operating results have been severely impacted by the reduced capital spending of the semiconductor industry 
while the industry has shown several signs of recovery over the past two years  it has been consistently disappointed by continued declines 
management believes the downturn is nearing its end but may continue through the first and second quarters of how quickly any recovery will take place is still subject to significant uncertainty 
the downturn has resulted in fewer contracts available to bid  a significant increase in price competition on contracts that were awarded  and reduced margins on such contracts 
during  the company experienced fewer new contract awards resulting in a decrease in the company s backlog from million at december  to million at december  although there is uncertainty surrounding the timing of a recovery in the semiconductor industry  management continues to believe that changes taking place in the industry should result in expanded semiconductor industry capital expenditures in the long term 
delays in the ramp up of mm technology have delayed the expected construction of a whole series of mm fabs worldwide 
due  in part  to the lack of mm process tools  weaker than expected demand  and the current focus on lowering process geometries from 
m to 
m  the mm effort appears to have been delayed indefinitely 
in response to the current downturn  management has taken steps to reduce the company s cost structure including a reduction in the company s work force of more than fifty percent during the fourth quarter of during  management will closely monitor the company s cost structure and take appropriate actions as considered necessary  but will continue to develop state of the art cleanroom technology and provide world class support to the company s customers 
in response to reduced revenue generated by the sale of cleanrooms  the company has recently undertaken several initiatives to expand its revenue base beyond the semiconductor industry and to reduce its reliance on this historically cyclical business 
during the first quarter of  the company announced its entrance into the transportation industry where it is producing sleeper cabs for heavy duty trucks 
by applying similar wall panel systems technology used in cleanrooms the company produces a stronger  more durable  and lighter weight product than traditional sleeper cabs 
during  this new product accounted for almost of total revenues and is expected to make an even greater contribution in additionally  the company has developed a line of commercial and industrial air handling systems for the commercial construction industry 
while development was begun during significant interest has been shown by the market in this product 
the company has also developed an air door system used by large national retail chains in their new superstores 
the air entrance is a recirculating air handling system using an overhead plenum to deliver high volume low velocity airflow across the open doorway  thus eliminating the need for physical doors 
this product also shows great promise of providing significant gross profit over the next two years 
additionally  the company has entered into several contract manufacturing agreements whereby the company manufactures products owned and marketed by third parties 
it is the company s objective to develop and maintain of its revenues from sources outside of the semiconductor industry by applying its product and engineering expertise in custom metal fabrication  airflow systems and panel production to similar type products used in other industries 
the company s revenue and operating results fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending on such factors as the timing of significant customer orders  the timing of revenue and cost recognition  variations in contract mix  changes in customer buying patterns  fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  utilization of capacity  manufacturing productivity and efficiency  availability of key components and trends in the economies of the geographical regions in which the company operates 
the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for its long term contracts 
the company recognizes revenue in proportion to the costs incurred to date in relation to the total anticipated costs 
revenue recognized may not be the same as progress billings to the customer 
underbillings are reflected in an asset account costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts in progress  and overbillings are reflected in a liability account billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on contracts in progress 
the company generates revenue in three geographic regions  north america  asia pacific rim and europe 
contracts in the asia pacific rim region are generally denominated in united states dollars 
although risk of fluctuations in currency value does not affect such dollar denominated contracts  changes in the relative value of the dollar could make the company less competitive in this region 
contracts to be performed in europe may be denominated in local currency  and the company bears the risk of changes in the relative value of the dollar and the local currencies 
devaluation of world currencies against the us dollar has created extreme price competitiveness from korean  japanese  and german manufacturers and integrators of systems 
the collapse of the korean marketplace in particular  has forced korean suppliers to look outside their historical business relationships for new markets 
the company has in the past and may in the future attempt to hedge against currency fluctuations on contracts denominated in local currencies 
there can be no assurance  however  that such hedging will fully insulate the company from fluctuations or will not expose the company to additional risks of loss 
the company s business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented 
results of operations revenue from operations change change cleanrooms and related products    other products  total revenue    revenue from cleanrooms and related products decreased in to million from million in the decrease was due to the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry s capital expenditures for new equipment and fab facilities as more fully discussed above 
during  contract revenue decreased by to million from million in this decrease is directly related to the beginning of the sudden and dramatic downturn in the semiconductor industry as more fully discussed above 
revenue from other products increased to million in from in the increase is due to the start up of new lines of business including the company s new line of sleeper cabs  contract manufacturing  and other product sales that were non existent in north america cleanroom revenue for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue  north america decreased to in compared to in the decrease in contract revenue is attributed to the semiconductor industry downturn resulting in fewer and smaller contracts available during than in revenue from other products of million was primarily attributable to sales of sleeper cabs sold only in north america in cleanroom revenue for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue north america decreased to in compared to in the decrease is the result of fewer contracts received in north america due to the precipitous decline in capital spending by the semiconductor industry 
asia pacific rim cleanroom revenue for the year ended december  increased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue asia pacific revenue increased to in compared to in the increase in revenue and percentage was due to the award of a significant project in china 
the contract was subsequently placed on indefinite suspension due to the uncertainty of the asian market 
cleanroom revenue for decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue asia pacific increased to in compared to in two factors contributed to the decrease in asia pacific revenue 
first  during the company recognized revenue for two significantly large contracts in taiwan 
these contracts were substantially completed during second  the semiconductor industry downturn impacted taiwan and other asian countries to the extent that the company did not have the same opportunity to bid on contracts in that it had during europe cleanroom revenue for the year ended december  increased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue european revenue increased to in compared to in while the semiconductor industry has experienced a worldwide downturn  it has not appeared to have affected the european segment as dramatically as the asian and north american markets 
additionally  the company has been able to win contracts in new countries that it has not done business in previously 
cleanroom revenue for decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total cleanroom revenue europe increased to in compared to in the decrease in volume is attributed to two factors 
first  the worldwide semiconductor industry downturn has delayed the investment into the european community by most major semiconductor manufacturers resulting in fewer contracts available during compared to second  during the company was involved in an unusually large project in france that generated a significant amount of revenue during that was not available to the company during gross profit change change gross profit    percentage of revenues gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  gross profit decreased as a percentage of revenue to for compared to for the decrease in gross margin is the direct result of the semiconductor industry downturn 
the downturn has resulted in fewer contracts awarded and those that were awarded were done so after a highly competitive bidding process placing significant downward pressure on pricing and thus resulting in lower margins 
gross profit for increased by to million from million in and decreased as a percentage of contract revenue to in from in the decrease in gross profit was the direct result of the massive reductions in contracts awarded form to as the semiconductor industry entered its first full year of its downturn 
during the company geared up and increased its production capacity in anticipation of continued significant increases in demand for its products 
as the downturn gained momentum throughout  the company had fewer contracts to which it could allocate its increased fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
additionally  the contracts that were awarded were done so at lower margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses change change selling  general and administrative expenses    percentage of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased to million  from million  and decreased as a percentage of revenue to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared with was the result of an aggressive cost reduction program as well as significant headcount reductions completed during the fourth quarter of where approximately employees were laid off  thus reducing payroll and related expenses in excess of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased to million  or of contract revenue  from million  or of revenue  in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was the result of a reduction in general and administrative headcount during the first and second quarters of in response to the significant reduction in cleanroom activity during the first half of research and development change change research and development expense percentage of revenues research and development expense increased slightly in actual dollars spent from to this increase was not material 
management believes that the company will increase its research and development expenses during  both in actual dollars spent and as a percentage of revenue in order to develop innovative products  to be on the cutting edge of the mm manufacturing facility technology and to modify existing products to be less expensive to produce and easier to install 
research and development expense decreased slightly from to this decrease was the result of fewer research and development projects that were based on specific customers and contracts 
depreciation and amortization change change depreciation and amortization expense percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization expense during increased by to  or of revenue  from  or of revenues  in this increase was the result of a full years depreciation expense on leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  computer equipment and software purchased during depreciation and amortization expense in increased by to  or of revenues  from  or of revenues  in this increase was the result of the purchase of leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  computer equipment and software required for the increased sales  marketing and administrative activities during other income expense  net change change other income expense percentage of revenues other income expense increased in to  from  in this increase was largely due to an increase in interest expense in resulting from an increase in the average outstanding balance on the company s revolving line of credit over other income expense decreased in to  from  in the decrease was the result of foreign currency losses recognized during from the decline in taiwan dollars throughout and a litigation settlement included as part of other income during income taxes benefit change change income taxes benefit    percentage of revenues the effective tax rate benefit for was approximately compared to for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate from to was primarily the result of a tax benefit resulting from the loss before taxes  calculated at the statutory federal rate see note i of notes to financial statements 
the decrease from to was primarily the result of tax benefits the company was able to utilize during on foreign sales which were taxed in the company s foreign sales corporation 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  this included cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and respectively 
receivables  including retentions  see note d of notes to financial statements decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease was the result of lower revenues from fewer contracts during compared to days sales outstanding the ratio between receivables  excluding retention  and average daily revenue taken over the year decreased to days at december   from days at december the company s operations used million of cash during  compared to providing million of cash in during  the company experienced a decrease in receivables of million as a result of the decline in revenues and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million 
the company maintained a revolving line of credit with a domestic bank for the lesser of million or the available borrowing base for the period ended december  and million for the period ended december  the interest rate is computed at the bank s prime rate percent at december  and requires monthly payments of interest 
the line of credit expired june  and was extended to december  the line of credit is collateralized by certain domestic receivables and inventories 
the line of credit agreement contains restrictive covenants imposing limitations on payments of cash dividends  purchases or redemptions of capital stock  indebtedness and other matters 
at december   the company was out of compliance on certain indebtedness covenants for which they signed a forbearance agreement with the lender where the lender has agreed to forbear exercise of its remedies against the company 
subsequent to year end the company signed an extension of the line of credit through march  the company is currently reviewing several financing alternatives 
during  the company used  for the purchase of property and equipment 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures in for routine additions and replacements of property  and equipment will be less than  these purchases will be financed through long term debt or capital leases 
management believes that existing cash balances  borrowings available under the line of credit  and cash generated from operations will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements through december  however  in the event the company experiences adverse operating performance  above anticipated capital expenditure requirements  or is unable to renew its existing line of credit  additional financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  would be available on favorable terms if at all 
year issues the company has developed a comprehensive plan to address year issues 
the areas of focus are as follows i the company s information technology systems  ii the company s non information technology systems ie machinery  equipment and devices which utilize built in or embedded technology  and iii third party suppliers and customers 
the company is undertaking its year review in the following phases awareness education and potential impact of year issue  identification identifying processes or systems which are exposed to the year issue  assessment identifying the potential impact of year on the equipment  processes and systems identified during the previous phase  testing and verification testing to determine if an item is compliant or the degree to which it is not  and implementation carrying out necessary remedial efforts to address year readiness  including validation of upgrades  patches or other year fixes 
during  the company completed the installation of oracle application software  a comprehensive enterprise wide business system 
this system affects nearly every aspect of the company s operations  including financial accounting  purchasing and accounts payable  raw material inventory control  production planning and scheduling  and invoicing and accounts receivable 
all oracle application software utilized by the company is fully year compliant 
in conjunction with the installation of the oracle software  the company installed new hp computer hardware to run the application software 
while the hp hardware is not yet fully year compliant  the company has in its possession the necessary software to make the hardware s operating systems fully year compliant and will so by late spring 
the company expects to test these hardware  operating systems and software applications in early to confirm year readiness 
the company has identified other hardware  operating systems and software applications used in its process control and other information systems and is in the process of obtaining year compliance information from the providers of such hardware  operating systems and applications software 
the company expects to work with vendors to test the year readiness of such hardware  operating systems and software application systems 
the company has no internally developed software applications 
the company has substantially completed inventorying its non information technology systems and is assessing the year issues to determine appropriate testing and remediation 
the company has completed its assessment of its major non information technology systems and is currently implementing patches to make all such systems fully year compliant 
the company has significant relationships with various third parties  and the failure of any of these third parties to achieve year compliance could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company expects to survey each major third party supplier to confirm their year readiness 
this review process will continue into the second quarter of the company is in the process of preparing contingency plans for critical areas to address year failures if remedial efforts are not fully successful 
the company s contingency plans are expected to target the company s most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
the company s contingency plans will be based in part on the results of third party supplier surveys and thus are not fully developed at this time 
completion of initial contingency plans is targeted for the summer of no assurance can be given that the company will not be materially adversely affected by year issues 
the company may experience material unanticipated problems and costs caused by undetected errors or defects in its information and non information technology systems 
in addition  the failure of third parties to timely address their year issues could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operations  and financial condition 
the installation of the oracle application software and related hardware and operating systems was done to improve information processing capabilities and efficiencies and was done irrespective of the year issue 
the company regularly upgrades its computer hardware and software components on a regular basis and believes it will not incur any additional material expense to modify its systems due to the year issue 
the foregoing discussion of the company s year readiness includes forward looking statements  including estimates of the timeframes and costs for addressing this issue and is based on management s current estimates which were derived using numerous assumptions 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved  and actual events and results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of personnel with required remediation skill  the ability of the company to identify and correct or replace all relevant computer code and the success of third parties with whom the company does business in addressing their year issues 
impact of future accounting pronouncements none 
factors affecting future results the company s future operations will be impacted by  among other factors  the length and severity of the current economic downturn in the semiconductor industry as more fully discussed above 
the length and severity of the current economic downturn in the semiconductor industry remains subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the company s operations are also subject to additional risks and uncertainties that could result in actual operating results differing materially from anticipated operating results and past operating results and trends 
these risks and uncertainties include pricing pressures  cancellations of existing contracts  timing of significant customer orders  increased competition  and changes in semiconductor and cleanroom technology
