although the obligations of buckhead  as lessee  under the company hotels leased by buckhead are guaranteed in part by buckhead  the ability of buckhead to make lease payments under the company hotel leases  and  therefore  the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  is dependent on the ability of buckhead to generate sufficient cash flow from such company hotels
