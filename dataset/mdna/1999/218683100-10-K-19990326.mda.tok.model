item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements under this caption of this annual report on form k constitute forward looking statements which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
core materials actual results may differ significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to business conditions in the plastics  transportation  recreation and consumer products industries  the general economy  competitive factors  the dependence on two major customers  the recent efforts of core materials to expand its customer base  new technologies  the year systems issue  regulatory requirements  labor relations  the loss or inability to attract key personnel  start up of the company s south carolina facility  the availability of capital and management s decisions to pursue new products or businesses which involve additional cost risks or capital expenditures 
overview on december   core materials acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of columbus plastics  a wholly owned operating unit of navistar s truck manufacturing division since its formation in late based on the terms of the acquisition  the transaction for financial reporting and accounting purposes has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby columbus plastics is deemed to have acquired core materials 
however  core materials is the continuing legal entity 
accordingly  any references to the operating results of core materials for refer to the historical operations of columbus plastics 
core materials manufactures high quality compression smc fiberglass reinforced parts 
core materials has two major customers  navistar and yamaha 
the demand for core materials products is affected by the volume of purchases from these two customers  whose orders are primarily affected by economic conditions in the united states and canada 
core materials manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component 
accordingly  during periods of changing demands  the profitability of core materials operations will change proportionately more than revenues from operations 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  navistar and core materials entered into a comprehensive supply agreement with an initial term of five years 
under the terms of the comprehensive supply agreement  core materials became the primary supplier of navistar s original equipment and service requirements for fiberglass reinforced parts using the smc process 
all sales and gross margin information for and reflects the results of the comprehensive supply agreement 
prior to january   columbus plastics had not been a stand alone operating entity 
as such  navistar had provided substantial management support in the form of treasury  legal  tax  information systems and other similar corporate support functions 
corporate general and administrative expenses have not been previously allocated to core materials 
for purposes of preparing the income statement of core materials for calendar year  included in this form k  these corporate costs have been allocated using a method management believes to be reasonable and reflective of those costs had they been incurred on a stand alone basis 
net sales for do not reflect the additional revenue that would have been generated had the comprehensive supply agreement been in effect at that time 
prior to the comprehensive supply agreement  all sales to navistar facilities were accounted for at columbus plastics standard costs 
in addition  columbus plastics did not incur certain expenses related to being a stand alone publicly traded entity  such as executive salary costs and legal and accounting fees 
finally  the results for do not reflect investment income or expenses for interest or income taxes 
thus  the results of are not readily comparable to the results of or in order to make this comparison more meaningful in the discussion which follows  pro forma financials have been prepared for see note in the notes to financial statements for further information 
in the discussion which follows  all references to and comparisons with the results of reflect the historical columbus plastics financials 
any dollars and or percentages in parentheses reflect references to and comparisons with pro forma financial information 
results of operations compared with net sales for totaled  up from the  reported for sales to navistar increased to  from  in the increase in sales to navistar was primarily the result of navistar s increased production of medium and heavy duty trucks 
sales to yamaha decreased in by to  compared with  in the slight decrease in sales to yamaha is primarily due to the maturing of the personal watercraft industry 
other sales increased to  from  in these additional sales were primarily the result of sales to new customers added in including case corporation  outboard marine corporation  and caradon doors and window  peachtree division  gross margin was of sales in compared with for the decline in gross margin as a percent of sales  versus  is primarily the result of unfavorable material usage variances  increased overtime costs  increased usage of production process supplies  changes in product mix  and startup costs at the gaffney  south carolina facility 
also impacting gross margin was the effect of increased lease expenses associated with a sale leaseback transaction 
as noted in note of the notes to financial statements  core materials sold various items of production equipment and leased the items back under operating lease agreements 
the proceeds of the sale were primarily used to pay down long term debt 
as a result of these transactions  core materials has recorded higher costs of sales  due to the lease payments exceeding the related depreciation for the sales leaseback equipment  offset by lower interest costs reflected below 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  increasing from  in the increase over the amounts is primarily due to the addition of a second plant in gaffney  south carolina 
this second plant provides additional capacity to support the production requirements of current customers and opportunity for growth 
the gaffney plant began molding and assembly operations in early interest expense for totaled  decreasing from the  incurred in the decrease in interest expense from is primarily the result of a reduction in interest costs on the secured note payable to navistar due to paydowns of principal on the note 
see note of notes to financial statements 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by increased interest costs due to the  of industrial revenue bond borrowings used to finance core materials new facility in gaffney  south carolina 
income tax expense for was approximately of total earnings before taxes 
actual tax payments will be substantially lower than the recorded expenses as core materials has substantial federal tax loss carryforwards 
these loss carryforwards were recorded as a deferred tax asset  partially offset by a valuation allowance at december  as a part of the purchase accounting adjustments 
as the tax loss carryforwards are utilized to offset federal income tax payments  core materials reduces the deferred tax asset as opposed to recording a reduction in income tax expense 
actual cash payments for are estimated to be approximately  which reflects federal alternative minimum  state and local taxes 
net income for was  or 
per basic and 
per diluted share  an increase of  or over the net income of  or 
per basic and 
per diluted share 
the increase over s amounts was primarily the result of increased sales as discussed above 
core materials has approximately  of operating tax loss carryforwards that do not begin to expire until the year the utilization of operating tax loss carryforwards for resulted in an increase in cash flow of approximately  since the company s estimated income tax payments were reduced 
the comparable reduction in income tax payments was  compared with net sales for totaled  up from the   reported for  historical and proforma 
sales to navistar increased to  from   in the increase in sales to navistar was primarily the result of a general increase in volume of industry sales and sales of certain heavy truck components which core materials began producing in june sales to yamaha decreased in by to  compared with  in the decrease in sales to yamaha is primarily due to yamaha s production slowdown as a result of the maturing of the personal watercraft industry 
other sales increased to  from  in these additional sales were primarily the result of increased sales of smc to an smc molder 
gross margin was of sales in compared with for the increased gross margin as a percent of sales  versus  was primarily due to the markup per the comprehensive supply agreement on sales to navistar 
the gross margin as a percent of sales increased over the pro forma adjusted percentage due to increased sales volumes and due to s cost of sales including higher than normal repair and maintenance expenses and unfavorable inventory adjustments 
additionally  core materials experienced increased control of its material related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  increasing from   in the increase over the amounts is primarily due to the company incurring expenses related to being a stand alone publicly traded entity  increased depreciation expense and increased employee related expenses 
other income totaled  in decreasing from  in the decrease from the actual amounts was primarily due to income generated in from a special tooling project for one customer 
interest income for totaled  and is primarily attributable to interest on core materials mortgage backed security investment 
interest expense for totaled  primarily reflecting interest on the secured note payable to navistar  this expense was offset by  of capitalized interest expense relating to property  plant and equipment under construction 
core materials had no interest income or interest expense in since all investing and financing was handled at navistar s corporate offices 
income taxes for were estimated to be approximately of total earnings before taxes 
actual tax payments will be substantially lower than the recorded expenses as core materials has substantial federal tax loss carryforwards 
these loss carryforwards were recorded as a deferred tax asset  partially offset by a valuation allowance at december  as a part of the purchase accounting adjustments 
as the tax loss carryforwards are utilized to offset federal income tax payments  core materials reduces the deferred tax asset as opposed to recording a reduction in income tax expense 
actual cash payments for were estimated to be approximately  which reflects federal alternative minimum  state and local taxes 
net income for was  or 
per diluted share  an increase of  or over the pro forma net income of  or 
per diluted share 
the increase over s pro forma amounts was primarily the result of increased sales and improved margins as delineated above 
core materials had approximately  of operating tax loss carryforwards that do not begin to expire until the year the utilization of operating tax loss carryforwards for resulted in an increase in cash flow of approximately  since the company s estimated income tax payments were reduced 
the comparable pro forma reduction in income tax payments was 
liquidity and capital resources core materials primary cash requirements are for operating expenses and capital expenditures 
these cash requirements have historically been met through a combination of cash flow from operations  equipment leasing  issuance of industrial revenue bonds and bank lines of credit 
cash provided by operations in totaled  resulting mainly from net income of  depreciation and amortization of  and deferred income taxes of  primarily related to core materials  of operating tax loss carry forwards  also contributed positively to the operating cash flow 
decreasing the operating cash flow was an increase in accounts receivable of  caused by higher sales and receivables for tooling projects for new products to be reimbursed by customers 
investing activities provided  of net positive cash flow in capital expenditures totaled  primarily related to the acquisition of machinery and equipment  including equipment for core materials new facility in gaffney  south carolina 
offsetting these expenditures were proceeds from the sale and leaseback of certain machinery and equipment of  and proceeds of maturities on the company s mortgage backed security investment of  financing activities provided  of net positive cash flow 
industrial revenue bonds irb in the amount of  were issued upon completion of core materials new south carolina facility 
core materials used  of the proceeds to pay down principal on the secured note payable to navistar 
all borrowings under lines of credit were also paid off in at december   core materials had cash on hand of  and an available line of credit of  management believes that these sources  along with internally generated funds from operations and future bank financing  will be sufficient to fund anticipated operating expenses and capital requirements 
income taxes the balance sheet at december  and includes a deferred tax asset of  and  respectively  net of a valuation allowance of  in and of  in the valuation allowance was reduced from  in to  in based upon an extensive review of future taxable income 
this reduction was recorded as an increase in paid in capital in the equity section see note 
the deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance since it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized in the future 
the deferred tax asset at december  primarily includes the tax benefits associated with cumulative net operating and capital tax losses of approximately million and million  respectively  temporary differences between the book and tax basis of core materials property and equipment of approximately million and temporary differences relating to post retirement and pension benefits of million 
the valuation allowance at december  assumes that it is more likely than not that approximately million of the cumulative net operating losses and all of the cumulative capital tax losses will not be realized before their expiration date 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on the generation of approximately million of future taxable income from through taxable income for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
based upon an extensive review of future taxable income  performed in the fourth quarter of  core materials reduced the valuation allowance related to the net operating loss carryforwards by million 
extensive analysis is performed to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset 
such analysis is based upon the premise that core materials is and will continue as a going concern and that it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
management reviews all available evidence  both positive and negative  to assess the long term earnings potential of core materials using a number of alternatives to evaluate financial results in economic cycles at various industry volume conditions 
other factors considered are the company s long standing relationship with its two largest customers navistar and yamaha and core materials recent customer diversification efforts 
the projected availability of taxable income to realize the tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of temporary differences before expiration of these benefits are also considered 
management believes that  with the combination of available tax planning strategies  the maintenance of its relationships with yamaha and navistar and navistar s maintenance of significant market share  earnings are achievable in order to realize the net deferred tax asset of  inflation inflation generally affects core materials by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
we believe that  because rates of inflation have been moderate during the periods presented  inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
year readiness statement core materials believes it has identified all of its significant software and hardware applications that will require modification to ensure year yk compliance 
internal and external resources are being used to make the required modifications to both computer systems and internal operations related apparatus 
in addition  core materials is working with its suppliers and customers to aid in their becoming yk compliant 
where able  core materials plans to complete the modifications by the end of july  this date is significant in that it is the next scheduled vacation plant shutdown date and some of the modifications must be completed while the columbus plant is not in operation 
in some cases  compliance cannot be achieved until january  on this date  a resetting of the internal clocks on some electronic devices is required 
in these cases  core materials has tested and will test the remaining apparatus by rolling the date before july to assure the dates will roll without problems 
core materials has grouped its exposure into major categories of items production equipment  information technology  facilities and utilities  quality systems  suppliers and customers  and general business items 
the status of each is as follows production equipment production equipment concerns can be grouped into the following areas press programmable logic units plc s  other non press related plc s  press computers  press software  robotics  paint control and tracking systems  and smc mix system software and computer 
core materials has contacted the manufacturers of the plc s in both and above 
those manufacturers have provided yk compliance repair procedures many of which cannot be implemented until january   however  core materials is currently testing the repair procedures 
this area provides a great deal of risk to core materials if all plc s fail simultaneously 
core materials plans to replace those press computers that must be replaced to obtain yk compliance 
press software has been tested and found to be capable of functioning beyond the year the manufacturer of the robotics systems has provided compliance repair procedures similar to that of the plc s  core materials is in the process of testing these repair procedures 
the paint control and tracking system has been replaced with yk compliant software and hardware 
the smc mix system software and computer will be replaced upgraded before mid year information technology core materials has used the yk problem as a catalyst to perform a complete replacement of all of its operations and financial systems 
the new system was activated in the gaffney operation in september of and in the columbus operation in november of many secondary software systems such as the fixed asset system and the maintenance system have already been replaced 
some secondary systems  posing no risk to core materials or its customers  are also being replaced and or upgraded with scheduled completion by the middle of the second quarter of most of the hardware and network infrastructure has been upgraded replaced with the remainder due for replacement by the beginning of the second quarter of in addition  the payroll systems have been replaced and are yk compliant 
facilities and utilities core materials major utility suppliers gas  electric  water  telephone have been contacted and  with the exception of water  have provided information stating that they will be yk compliant before compliance becomes an issue 
there are no contingency plans for these suppliers as alternate utility sources are not available 
if a continued or catastrophic failure with these utility suppliers occurs  the continuing operations of core materials would be in serious jeopardy 
other areas of lesser concern include fire and alarm  and environmental control systems 
core materials has received verification from the environmental control system and hvac system manufacturers that they are compliant 
core materials is pursuing documentation from the manufacturers of its fire and alarm systems to certify yk compliance and or to direct core materials in updating these systems to yk compliance 
quality systems the primary system used for tracking quality and internal production documentation has been replaced and according to the manufacturer is yk compliant 
the only other quality items believed to be of concern are the laboratory and testing apparatus 
these apparatus are currently being tested and contingency plans including using outside laboratories for testing have been developed 
suppliers and customers substantially all of core materials significant current suppliers and customers have been contacted and are currently responding with their yk compliance status 
most responses have been noncommittal as to yk readiness 
such contact will continue to be made for all subsequently added suppliers and customers 
alternate suppliers are being identified for those companies that have expressed a problem with compliance and for key suppliers in general 
additional contingencies include purchasing and stocking low cost materials as required 
general business items general business items include items such as banking  insurance  pension plans  and k programs 
core materials has made contact with the suppliers of these services and has received confirmation from most that compliance is eminent 
core materials will consider another provider for those items for which compliance will not be met 
contingency plan core materials recognizes that the actual outcome of its yk efforts may differ from that discussed above 
as a result  core materials is reviewing other potential outcomes in an attempt to mitigate the negative effects on core materials ability to effectively and efficiently function as a business 
in the event that the solutions identified above are not effective  core materials would employ other resources  such as underutilized equipment  manual processes  and outside services to complete the required tasks 
it is unlikely that with such alternative resources core materials would be able to deliver the full level of goods and services required by its customers 
worst case scenarios would include failure of most or all of the equipment  failure of energy suppliers to deliver gas or electricity  and or failure of suppliers including alternate suppliers to provide production materials 
while core materials feels that the probability of these scenarios is low  the realization of such scenarios would have a serious detrimental effect on core materials operations  liquidity and financial condition 
in such a worst case scenario  core materials would be heavily dependent on the ability of the vendors suppliers to resolve their own yk issues 
the overall impact of such a worst case scenario would be dependent on the length of time before the problems are resolved 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  approximately  is attributed to new software hardware which will be capitalized 
the remaining  which will be expensed as incurred  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
to date  core materials has incurred approximately  of costs associated with this project of which  was capitalized  relating to the purchase of new hardware and software and  of which has been expensed 
the costs of the project and the date on which core materials believes it will complete the year modification are based on management s best estimates 
these estimates were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors  however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the assurances of outside companies  and similar uncertainties 
in addition  core materials has been and will continue to communicate with others with whom it does significant business to determine their year issues  however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which core materials systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the core materials systems  would not have a material adverse affect on core materials 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement defines whether or not certain costs related to the development or acquisition of internal use software should be expensed or capitalized and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  core materials does not believe that the new statement will have a material impact on its results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  to establish accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments 
this standard requires recognition of all derivative instruments in the statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities  measured at fair value  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement additionally requires changes in the fair value of derivatives to be recorded each period in current earnings or comprehensive income depending on the intended use of the derivatives 
core materials is currently assessing the impact of this statement on its results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk core materials primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
core materials is also exposed to changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations 
however  commodity price risk related to the company s current commodities is not material as price changes in commodities are usually passed along to the final customer 
the company does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
core materials has the following three items that are market rate sensitive for interest rates long term debt consisting of an industrial revenue bond irb with a balance at december  of  interest is variable and is computed weekly  the average interest rate charged for was  the maximum interest rate that may be charged at any time over the life of the irb is 
in order to minimize the effect of the interest rate fluctuation  core materials has entered into an interest rate swap arrangement 
under this agreement  core materials pays a fixed rate of to a bank and receives of the day commercial paper rate 
core materials also has a long term secured note with a balance as of december  of  at a fixed interest rate of 
and core materials has a mortgage backed security investment  which matures in november  and such security is recorded at cost 
the security is considered held to maturity as core materials has the intent and ability to hold such security to maturity 
assuming a hypothetical change in short term interest rates  interest expense would not change significantly  as the interest rate swap agreement would generally offset the impact
