this compares with the  million  or per diluted share  we earned in our net income includes earnings of million from the associates through march  and a one time  non cash gain of  million that resulted from our spin off of the associates 
excluding these amounts related to the associates  our net income would have been  million  or per diluted share of common and class b stock  compared with net income excluding the associates earnings of  million  or per diluted share 
our net income also includes the following other one time charges totaling million  which we incurred in the fourth quarter million for employee early retirement and separation programs  million for writing off our net exposure in kia motors company  and million relating to the transfer of our batavia  ohio transmission plant to a new joint venture company formed by us and zf friedrichshafen ag to manufacture continuously variable transmissions

our worldwide revenues were billion in  down billion from we sold  cars and trucks in  down  units from our stockholders equity was billion at december   down billion compared with december  this reduction primarily was a result of the associates spin off 
fourth quarter results of operations in the fourth quarter of  we earned  million  or per diluted share of common and class b stock  compared with  million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of the one time charges discussed above and the absence of earnings from the associates in the fourth quarter of more than account for the earnings decline

in  million new cars and trucks were sold in europe  up from million units in our share of those unit sales was in  down percentage points from a year ago 
in the fourth quarter of  our market share in europe was  down percentage points 
our market share declined because of intense competitive conditions in europe and limited availability of our new focus car line during its launch 
our automotive sector in south america lost million in  compared with a profit of million in the decline was the result of lower volume and revenue resulting from weak economic conditions and charges we incurred for employee reductions  offset partially by lower costs

visteon s after tax return on sales in was  up one percentage point compared with the prior year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial services sector earnings of our financial services sector consist primarily of two segments  ford credit and hertz 
in we spun off the associates to our shareholders  resulting in a  million gain to ford 
for details of the spin off see note page fs of our notes to financial statements 
ford credit s consolidated net income in was  million  up million or from compared with  the increase in full year earnings primarily reflects improved credit loss performance  higher gains on receivable sales  lower effective tax rates and higher financing volumes  offset partially by lower net financing margins and higher operating costs 
lower financing margins reflect higher depreciation expense for leased vehicles as a result of lower than anticipated residual values 
earnings at hertz in were million of which million was ford s share 
in  hertz had earnings of million of which million was ford s share 
the increase in earnings reflects primarily higher revenues and improved profit margins in worldwide car rental operations 
review of financial targets we set and communicated the financial targets listed below for our results against these targets also are listed below

ford credit s shortfall to achieve the target to grow earnings by reflected primarily the impact of lower than anticipated residual values 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared with automotive sector our automotive sector earnings in north america were a record  million in  up  million from the increase reflected higher margins from ongoing cost  quality  and vehicle mix improvements 
adjusted for constant volume and mix  total automotive costs declined billion in the after tax return on sales was in  up percentage points from the us economy continued on a path of strong growth  low unemployment  and moderate inflation in in  million new cars and trucks were sold  about the same level as ford s share of those unit sales was  down of a percentage point from our automotive sector operations in europe returned to profitability in with earnings of million  compared with a loss of million in the improvement reflected primarily lower operating costs at constant volume and mix  offset partially by lower volume 
in  million new cars and trucks were sold  compared with million units in ford s share was  down of a percentage point from our automotive sector operations in south america were profitable  earning million in  compared with a loss of million in higher earnings reflected primarily improved volume and mix  and lower material costs at constant volume and mix

ford s share of those unit sales was in  up percentage points from financial services sector earnings for the financial services sector in were down million  compared with excluding the one time actions in and shown previously  results from operations in were down million from lower earnings at ford credit in  compared with  resulted primarily from lower net financing margins  higher credit losses and loss reserve requirements  and a higher effective tax rate  improved operating costs and higher financing volumes were a partial offset 
net financing margins decreased from  reflecting higher depreciation costs on leased vehicles as a result of lower than anticipated residuals 
credit losses as a percent of average net finance receivables including net investment in operating leases were in  compared with in  reflecting higher losses per repossession 
record earnings at the associates reflected primarily higher levels of earning assets and improved net interest margins  offset partially by higher credit losses 
credit losses as a percent of average net finance receivables were in  compared with in record earnings at hertz reflected continued strong performance in the us car rental market both in terms of increased transaction volume and more favorable pricing 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources automotive sector at december   our automotive sector had billion of cash and marketable securities  up billion from december  this increase occurred even though we paid a total of billion in regular cash dividends on our common stock  class b stock and preferred stock during  and paid a special cash dividend of billion related to the associates spin off 
in  we spent billion for capital goods  such as machinery  equipment  tooling and facilities  used in our automotive sector 
this is down million from capital expenditures were of sales in  up of a percentage point from a year ago 
at december   our automotive sector had total debt of billion 
this amount was of our total capitalization that is  the sum of our stockholders equity and automotive debt at the end of  compared with of total capitalization at year end financial services sector the associates spin off primarily explains the declines discussed below 
at december   our financial services sector had cash and marketable securities totaling billion  down billion from december  net receivables and lease investments were billion at december   down million from december  total debt was billion at december   down billion from december  outstanding commercial paper at december  totaled billion at ford credit  and billion at hertz  with an average remaining maturity of days and days  respectively 
for a discussion of the credit and other financial support facilities for our automotive and financial services sectors at december   see note pages fs and fs of our notes to financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year date conversion general an issue affecting ford and others is the inability of many computer systems and applications to process the year and beyond yk 
to address this problem  in  we initiated a global yk program to manage ford s overall yk compliance effort 
as part of this program  we established a global central program office to coordinate our yk compliance efforts 
we also have established a yk steering committee comprised of senior executives to address compliance issues 
ford s yk program has been certified by the information technology association of america as meeting its yk best practices standards 
state of readiness we achieved all compliance objectives that we set for ourselves for  including interim objectives 
we expect to complete most of the remaining remediation efforts by the end of june  with the rest completed in the third quarter of we have identified the following ten distinct areas for ford s yk compliance efforts business computer systems these include computer systems and applications relating to operations such as financial reporting  human resources  manufacturing  marketing and sales including vehicle ordering  product engineering and design  purchasing  and treasury 
in we implemented a compliance plan focused on critical systems 
by year end  all critical systems had been repaired  tested  independently verified and implemented into a production environment 
in addition  we initiated an enterprise test plan for all key business processes in november as of february   of all business computer systems were yk compliant 
plant floor equipment we have implemented a process to assess equipment and machinery in our manufacturing and assembly plants and parts warehouse facilities 
we have implemented strategies to repair  replace  or develop contingency plans for all non compliant hardware and software 
as of february   of our plant floor systems were yk compliant  and of those systems that are critical were yk compliant 
suppliers ford has deployed  in conjunction with an industry trade association the automotive industry action group  a process to pursue a common yk compliance approach with the automotive supply industry in north america 
similar actions are underway in europe and the rest of the world 
yk awareness and educational sessions have been made available to first  second  and third tier suppliers 
ford does business with approximately  vehicle production and critical non production suppliers 
we have asked each of these suppliers to respond to a yk compliance questionnaire  and a majority of them have done so 
based on these responses  the criticality of the product or service being supplied and other factors  during we will selectively audit yk compliance of our suppliers 
vehicle components although testing continues  we have determined that the yk problem does not affect the onboard computer systems in our vehicles 
the functionality of these systems is based generally on engine cycles or the time elapsed since the vehicle was started  not any particular date 
we have surveyed suppliers of microprocessors and embedded system assemblies  and no problems have been identified to date 
recent internal global surveys to all ford employees have substantiated these findings 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued affiliates ford credit  hertz  and our other consolidated subsidiaries  as well as our non consolidated joint ventures  have developed plans to address yk compliance similar to those of ford 
we have contacted and are monitoring over affiliates to ensure plans are in place to achieve timely yk compliance 
product development test equipment this includes equipment and systems for testing vehicle emissions  safety and performance 
we are working with suppliers to replace our non compliant systems with common global test systems where needed 
as of february   of our product development test systems were yk compliant  and of those systems that are critical were yk compliant 
end user computing desktop computers are used throughout ford 
our plans to make these computers yk compliant include the replacement or repair of all non compliant computers and related software  distribution of an assessment tool for end user developed applications and the training of over end user program coordinators worldwide 
as of february   of critical end user programs were yk compliant 
technical infrastructure we established a dedicated testing facility to repair and test our critical systems infrastructures  such as wide area networks  local area networks  electronic data centers  and e mail systems 
as of february   of our hardware  software and global communications network were yk compliant 
dealers we are handling the compliance of all ford developed dealer systems  such as vehicle and parts ordering systems 
dealer compliance efforts with respect to other systems are being monitored by us through various dealer service providers 
physical properties and infrastructures we have assessed the impact of yk on all building systems globally in two phases 
phase i included energy management  fire  and security systems in our production facilities 
we are correcting problems where required 
phase ii of the program has expanded to include leased office facilities 
these facilities have minimal yk issues 
as of february   of our plant  engineering support and owned office building systems were yk compliant 
we are also confirming the yk preparedness of our energy and other utility suppliers 
on the next page is a timetable showing ford s internal target dates for compliance and the status of compliance at february  for each of the areas mentioned above 
we established these target dates before december  to allow sufficient time to perform enterprise wide testing and further validation of our yk compliance 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year program timing status as of february  business computer systems plan compliant by status a plant floor equipment plan compliant by status b production and critical non production suppliers plan ready c by status vehicle components plan compliant by status affiliates plan ready c by status pd test equipment plan compliant by status d critical end user computing plan compliant by status technical infrastructure plan compliant by status dealers plan ready c by status physical properties and infrastructure plan compliant by status a of critical business computer systems were compliant at year end b of critical plant floor equipment was compliant at february  c ready means having a comprehensive yk program in place and a plan that will achieve compliance before january  d of critical pd test equipment was compliant at february  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued yk costs we estimate that we will spend about million for our yk compliance efforts 
we will incur this amount over about a three year period that commenced mid and will end mid yk compliance costs incurred through december  were about million 
our annual yk costs relating to information technology have represented and are expected through year end to represent about of our total annual information technology budget 
yk risks the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for ford with respect to the yk problem is the failure of a supplier  including an energy supplier  to be yk compliant such that its supply of needed products or services to a ford or supplier manufacturing facility is interrupted temporarily 
this could result in ford not being able to produce one or more vehicle lines for a period of time  which in turn could result in lost sales and profits 
we are monitoring the preparedness of utility suppliers to ensure plans are in place for uninterrupted service 
yk contingency plans we have established a yk business resumption planning committee to evaluate business disruption scenarios  coordinate the establishment of yk contingency plans  and identify and implement preemptive strategies 
the committee will develop detailed contingency plans for critical business processes by the end of march and will validate those plans by the end of june euro conversion a single currency called the euro was introduced in europe on january  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their common legal currency as of that date 
fixed conversion rates between these participating countries existing currencies the legacy currencies and the euro were established as of that date 
the legacy currencies will remain legal tender as denominations of the euro until at least january  but not later than july  
during this transition period  parties may settle transactions using either the euro or a participating country s legacy currency 
the increased price transparency resulting from the use of a single currency in the eleven participating countries may affect the ability of ford and other companies to price their products differently in the various european markets 
a possible result of this is price harmonization at lower average prices for products sold in some markets 
nevertheless  differences in national value added tax regimes  national vehicle registration taxes  customer preferences for equipment and options  sizes and types of vehicles and engines  and trade in values may reduce the potential for price harmonization 
introduction of the euro may reduce the amount of ford s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates  due to the netting effect of having assets and liabilities denominated in a single currency as opposed to the various legacy currencies 
as a result  our foreign exchange hedging costs could be reduced 
conversely  because there will be less diversity in our exposure to foreign currencies  movements in the euro s value in us dollars could have a more pronounced effect  whether positive or negative  on us 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we have budgeted up to million including contingencies for the period from through to cover the worldwide costs of preparing for and making operational changes to accommodate introduction of the euro 
certain of our business functions have introduced euro capability as of january   including  for example  systems for making and receiving certain payments  pricing and invoicing 
other business functions will be converted for the euro by the end of the transition period december   but may be converted earlier where operationally efficient or cost effective  or to meet customer needs 
dissolution of autoeuropa joint venture effective january   our joint venture with volkswagen ag in portugal autoeuropa was dissolved 
this action will improve our first quarter after tax results by approximately million 
prior to the dissolution  we held a interest in autoeuropa and accounted for it on an equity basis 
volvo on march   we entered into a definitive agreement with ab volvo for the purchase of volvo s worldwide passenger car business for a price of billion 
on march   ab volvo s shareholders approved the transaction 
the transaction will close following receipt of regulatory approvals 
rouge complex on february   an explosion occurred at the powerhouse of the rouge complex in dearborn  michigan  completely halting production at the powerhouse 
thirty one people were injured or died as a result of this accident 
the powerhouse supplied energy and steam to the entire rouge complex 
we own part of the powerhouse and have manufacturing plants and an assembly plant located within the complex 
those plants supply products to various ford manufacturing and assembly plants worldwide 
through alternative sources of power we have resumed normal production at all of our manufacturing and assembly plants in the rouge complex 
a significant supplier of steel to us also is located in the rouge complex 
we do not know when that supplier will be able to fully resume its production 
in the interim  we have implemented contingency plans for temporary alternative sources of steel 
we have insurance  including business interruption coverage  which should limit the financial impact from the accident 
new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june we adopted sfas effective with the financial statements 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in february we adopted sfas effective with the financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  was issued by the american institute of certified public accountants in march this sop provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and requires capitalization of certain internal use computer software costs 
we will adopt this sop for costs incurred beginning january  adoption of this standard is expected to improve full year after tax results by an estimated million 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measurement of those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be designated specifically as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment referred to as a fair value hedge  b a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction a cash flow hedge  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  an unrecognized firm commitment  an available for sale security  or a forecasted transaction 
we anticipate having each of these types of hedges  and we will comply with the requirements of sfas when we adopt it 
we expect to adopt sfas beginning january  we have not yet determined the effect of adopting sfas outlook industry sales volumes our outlook for car and truck industry sales in in our major markets is as follows united states between to million units  compared with the million units sold in europe lower than the million units sold in brazil substantially lower than the million units sold in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial targets ford s management has set and communicated certain financial targets for while we hope to achieve these goals  they should not be interpreted as projections  expectations or forecasts of results 
the financial targets for are as follows automotive sector full year target north america after tax return on sales greater than europe grow earnings south america improve operating results total costs down billion from at constant volume and mix capital spending billion includes capitalized software visteon grow earnings  obtain billion of new business financial services sector ford credit grow earnings by hertz record earnings eighth consecutive year of increased earnings total company total shareholder returns top quartile of the s p over time because the brazilian market has deteriorated more than expected in the first quarter of  our current forecast is for worse operating results 
risk factors statements included in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated  including  without limitation greater price competition in the us and europe resulting from currency fluctuations or industry overcapacity  a significant decline in us or european industry sales resulting from slowing economic growth  currency fluctuations  further economic difficulties in south america  including those resulting from brazilian government austerity programs  a market shift from truck sales in the us  lower than anticipated residual values for leased vehicles  problems relating to the yk issue  increased safety or emissions regulation resulting in higher costs and or sales restrictions  work stoppages at key ford or supplier facilities  and the discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in recall campaigns  increased warranty costs or litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ford is exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
our automotive sector frequently has expenditures denominated in foreign currencies  including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends  and investments in subsidiaries 
these expenditures create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
we also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our automotive sector 
to ensure funding over business and economic cycles and to minimize overall borrowing costs  our financial services sector issues debt and other payables with various maturity and interest rate structures 
the maturity and interest rate structures frequently differ from the invested assets 
exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are created by the difference in maturities of liabilities versus the maturities of assets 
we monitor and manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results 
the effect of changes in exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on our earnings generally has been small relative to other factors that also affect earnings  such as unit sales and operating margins 
for more information on these financial exposures  see note pages fs and fs and note pages fs and fs of our notes to financial statements 
our interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk are quantified below 
our risks related to commodity derivative positions are not material 
interest rate risk we use interest rate swaps including those with a currency swap component primarily at ford credit to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on earnings by changing the characteristics of debt to match the characteristics of assets 
all interest rate swap agreements are designated to hedge either a specific debt issue or pool of debt 
we use a model to assess the sensitivity of our earnings to changes in market interest rates 
the model recalculates earnings by adjusting rates associated with variable rate instruments on the repricing date and by adjusting rates on fixed rate instruments scheduled to mature in the subsequent twelve months  effective on their scheduled maturity date 
interest income and interest expense are then recalculated based on the revised rates 
assuming an instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to all financial instruments and leased assets  our after tax earnings would change by million over a month period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued foreign currency risk we use derivative financial instruments to hedge assets  liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
we use a value at risk var analysis to evaluate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary assumptions used in the var analysis are as follows a historical time series analysis variance covariance is used to calculate changes in the value of currency derivative instruments forwards and options and all significant underlying exposures 
the var includes an month exposure horizon and a one month holding period 
the var analysis calculates the potential risk  within a confidence level  on firm commitment exposures cash flows  including the effects of foreign currency derivatives 
translation exposures are not included in the var analysis 
the model generally assumes currency prices are normally distributed and draws volatility data from the currency markets 
estimates of correlations of market factors primarily are drawn from the jp morgan riskmetricstm datasets 
based on our overall currency exposure including derivative positions during  the risk during to our pre tax cash flow from currency movements was on average less than million  with a high of million and a low of million 
at december   currency movements are projected to affect our pre tax cash flow over the next months by less than million  within a confidence level 
compared with our projection at december   the var amount is approximately million higher  primarily because of increased currency exchange rate volatility and increased exposure
