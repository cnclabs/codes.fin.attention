subscription rights declaration on october  the company s board of directors adopted a subscription rights declaration  pursuant to which one subscription right a right was granted for each outstanding ordinary share of the company 
each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the company one ordinary share at a price of per ordinary share  subject to adjustment 
the rights are not currently exercisable  but would be exercisable if certain events occurred related to a person or group acquiring or attempting to acquire beneficially or more of the outstanding ordinary shares 
the rights expire on october   unless cancelled or exchanged earlier by the company 
the rights have certain anti takeover effects 
the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the company without conditioning the offer on cancellation of the rights or on a substantial number of the rights being acquired 
accordingly  the existence of the rights may deter acquirors from making takeover proposals and tender offers 
takeover proposals and tender offers typically result in an increase in the trading price of the stock of the target company 
however  the rights are designed to provide additional protection against abusive takeover tactics such as offers for all shares at less than full value or at an inappropriate time in terms of maximizing long term shareholder value  partial tender offers and selective open market purchases 
the rights are intended to enhance the power of the company s board of directors to protect shareholders and the company if efforts are made to gain control of the company in a manner that is not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders 
the rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the board of directors of the company

the company believes that these actions are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims 
although the outcome of these actions cannot presently be determined  an adverse resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
on october   a derivative complaint was filed in the superior court of california for the county of san mateo against several present and former officers and directors of the company alleging that these persons violated various duties to the company 
the derivative complaint also names the company as a nominal defendant 
the derivative complaint is predicated on the factual allegations contained in the class action complaints discussed above 
no demand was previously made to the company s board of directors or shareholders concerning the allegations of the derivative complaint  which seeks an unspecified amount of damages 
during the period covered by this report  the previously disclosed possible litigation involving the transfer of certain securities of datacode electronics ltd 
was settled 
all amounts paid in relation to the settlement have been expensed

the company issued  ordinary shares at the date of acquisition to the former shareholders of forefront and assumed options  warrants and other rights to acquire forefront common stock that could be exercised for approximately million ordinary shares 
the transaction has been accounted for as a pooling of interests in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the successful combination of cbt group and forefront  including the successful operation of forefront as an autonomous subsidiary of cbt group  has required and will continue to require substantial effort from each company 
the company has experienced some difficulties in the integration of forefront and cbt  in particular in connection with the integration of the two companies sales operations 
these difficulties contributed to the company s failure to achieve its internal revenue expectations in the third quarter of and have continued to affect the company since that time 
these difficulties could continue to have a negative effect on future results  which could be material 
share split on march  the company effected a two for one split of its issued and outstanding adss 
subsequent thereto  the company s shareholders approved a proposal at the company s annual general meeting to subdivide each of the ordinary shares of irp into four ordinary shares of irp each the ordinary share split 
as a consequence of the ordinary share split  effective may  each ads represents and is exchangeable for one ordinary share the ratio change 
aside from the ratio change  the ordinary share split had no effect on the adss and had no effect on the number of adss outstanding 
industry background business organizations continue to be dependent upon computer systems in order to remain competitive in their markets 
this trend has resulted in significant growth in it education and training 
according to international data corporation idc  the global market for it education and training was approximately billion compared to billion in idc has stated that one of the most evident characteristics which define the it education and training market is that it is a market in transformation  where the one primary constant appears to be growth 
the transformation per idc is primarily due to expanding alternatives of how training can be delivered to the customer  the widening number of service and product options coming to the market and the evolving it training value proposition being presented to the customer 
idc has noted that there has been a number of identifiable trends which have helped cause this market transformation  the most significant being the shortage of it skills as the worldwide demand is outstripping the existing supply of it professionals a shift in the market towards technology based training due to corporations growing time and budgetary constraints  coupled with an expanding need to train people across a wide number of geographic regions global firms moving to use global suppliers due to strategies which are worldwide in scope and implementation 
these trends are resulting in increased consolidation among suppliers in the market  which changes the competitive nature of the market 
traditionally  organizations have primarily fulfilled their requirements for it education and training through instructor led training from external vendors or internal training departments 
instructor led training  however  has a number of limitations 
instructor led training typically requires employees to leave their desks for prolonged periods  often to attend classes at off site locations 
such training is also difficult to tailor to individuals training needs  cannot be easily reviewed and assessed by information service is managers and may not offer a cost effective training solution 
the limitations of instructor led training  combined with constrained is budgets  larger numbers of employees requiring training and the greater breadth of training needed per employee  have prompted organizations to consider alternative training methodologies 
idc estimates that the instructor led training market share has experienced a decline over the last several years  although the majority of training continues to be instructor led 
the proliferation of computers throughout organizations  the increasing multimedia capabilities of computers and the emergence of a web infrastructure in many companies are supporting the emergence of interactive it education and training software 
according to idc  the us market for technology based it education and training  including multimedia software  distance learning and electronic performance support systems  was billion in  compared to billion in  representing a annual growth rate 
the company believes that as businesses seek out alternative methods of training employees  there is a significant market opportunity for software that can meet businesses needs for productive  flexible and cost effective it education and training 
although interactive it education and training software programs have been available for many years  they currently account for only a small portion of the overall market for it training 
according to idc  technology based it education and training in had a market share of of the us it education and training market  compared to in the company s future success will depend upon  among other factors  the extent to which companies continue to adopt interactive education and training programs

in general  cbt group s courseware includes a graphically sophisticated interface that leads students through the subject software  simulating the technology this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
the company s actual future performance may not meet the company s current expectations or its current plans may change 
investors are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled additional risk factors that could affect operating results commencing on page and discussions elsewhere in this annual report on form k of the factors that could affect future performance 
and requiring students to respond actively to the course 
cbt group interactive training typically provides the user with anywhere from to hours of instruction per individual title 
students may also use the courses to pre test their capabilities in order to position themselves properly within the course and to train only in relevant areas 
at the end of the course  students may take a test to measure accurately their mastery of the course content 
the results of this test may be viewed by a central administrator using cbt group s administrative program or exported to a standard database or spreadsheet 
cbt group has developed its cbtcampus enterprise wide network based administrative software program designed to allow a central administrator to track the use of each course  track employee performance and create specialized curricula for employees by granting access to selected courses 
cbt group licenses its products primarily through license agreements under which customers may use the delivered products for a period of one  two or three years 
the license agreement format generally allows customers to exchange courses on each anniversary date where the agreement is for more than one year 
in order to increase the number of titles or gain access to the library at a time other than the specified dates  the customer may enter into a new license agreement or upgrade the existing license agreement 
volume and multi year discounts encourage customers to expand license agreements as their needs grow and as they become more familiar with the company s product library 
the company s pricing varies primarily based on the number of users  the number of titles selected and the length of the contract 
the company s strategy is to develop comprehensive curricula  each of which provides training in areas related to client server  mainframe and internet and intranet technologies 
the company s courses are generally compatible with the wintel platform 
in addition to its continued support of traditional lan environments  cbt group has developed a number of products that address the emerging internet and corporate intranet markets 
cbtweb is an intranet deployment system which allows users to download cbt group courseware titles across an intranet 
access to these titles is gained through a standard browser 
cbtweb enables customers to access and manage cbt group courses over an intranet via internally managed web servers 
using cbtweb  learners can choose to either download cbt group courseware or interact with it in real time over an intranet using cbt systems liveplaytm capability 
the downloaded courseware contains a utility to send the student records back to a central administrator so that the student progress may be monitored 
cbtweb plus is a turnkey training solution that enables customers to benefit from internet based deployment of cbt group s entire library of titles without the need to install server side software on their own network 
cbtweb plus is an externally hosted version of cbtweb that allows customers to have their cbt group courseware managed over the internet from an external site 
cbtweb plus is designed to relieve customers of any network infrastructure or security issues  and minimizes human resource requirements  while providing a high level of deployment flexibility since each student receives cbt group s training from his or her preferred location 
in july  cbt group released cbtcampus  cbt group s training management and deployment architecture 
coupled with cbt group s library of titles  cbtcampus provides cbt group s customers with a solution for delivering sophisticated interactive technology training wherever and however it s needed  running over an intranet 
cbtcampus features a university campus metaphor as an easy to navigate student interface  which can be accessed either as a windows client application or a web browser plug in 
behind this intuitive interface is a suite of sophisticated technologies that creates an integrated learning environment for students and administrators 
the market for it education and training is rapidly evolving 
new methods of delivering interactive education software are being developed and offered in the marketplace  including intranet and internet deployment systems 
many of these new delivery systems will involve new and different business models and contracting mechanisms 
in addition  multimedia and other product functionality features are being added to the educational software 
accordingly  cbt group s future success will depend upon  among other factors  the extent to which cbt group is able to develop and implement products that address these emerging market requirements 
there can be no assurance that cbt group will be successful in meeting changing market needs 
failure to develop and implement products that address these emerging market requirements could have a material adverse affect on cbt group s business and results of operations 
moreover  software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or fail when first introduced or upon release of new versions of the company s products 
the company has in the past experienced problems in the introduction of software products  in particular the cbt campus deployment and management system 
while the company believes that the critical problems have been addressed  the company plans to introduce new versions of the product to offer performance improvements and feature enhancements 
if the company were to fail to introduce new versions of this and other products  or to experience further problems in connection with the introductions  the company could suffer a material adverse effect on its operating results 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in a loss of or delay in market acceptance 
the subject matter of the company s courseware is influenced by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent introductions of new products by software vendors 
accordingly  the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to meet these changes by enhancing its existing courses and developing and introducing new courses on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing the changing needs of the marketplace by developing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely basis 
if the company were unable  due to resource  technological or other constraints  to anticipate and respond adequately to changes in customers software technology and preferences  the company s business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
research and development cbt group believes that the development of an effective training product requires the convergence of source material  instructional design and computer technology 
the first step in developing a new training program is to obtain content through subject matter experts  existing courses  including self study courses  and product reference materials  including product manuals 
the cbt group development team then writes a script for the program which includes a structure covering all of the relevant concepts  tasks to be completed  interactive features and tests to measure achievement and to reinforce the lesson 
during the development of a script for a new program  the company s developers  working with animators  simulation programmers and graphic designers  simultaneously plan and develop the course elements 
these elements are then integrated into a single program 
the program is then tested to ensure that each course delivers the desired education and training 
the core of cbt group s product development is its product development engine an environment comprising cbt group proprietary software and off the shelf tools which has been optimized for the creation of interactive education software programs 
the company believes that its product development engine provides a competitive advantage by allowing the company to create modular courses  identify and change portions of a course without rewriting the entire course and enhance the multimedia content of its courses more quickly and efficiently 
the company s technology generally supports a common product architecture  resulting in products that have a recognizable and consistent interface and are easier to support 
the company s goal is to continue to enhance its product development engine to meet the company s future development needs  including ensuring that its courseware is able to incorporate a wide variety of multimedia elements 
the company performs substantially all of its research and development activities and develops substantially all of its courses at its dublin  ireland development facility 
from time to time  the company subcontracts outside development services to develop portions of particular courses 
all products produced using these outside developers remain the sole property of cbt group 
during   and research and development expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during  the company s research and development staff grew from to employees 
the company intends to continue to make substantial investments in research and development 
development and marketing alliances the company s strategy is to expand its position in the it education and training market by forming development and marketing alliances with leading it software vendors 
cbt group has entered into alliances with cisco  informix  intel  lotus  microsoft  netscape  novell  oracle  sap  marimba  sybase  and the ibm sun microsystems netscape collaborative java education effort 
cbt group has also formed the internet security training consortium with check point  cisco  ibm  intel  the javasoft business unit of sun microsystems  inc  lotus  netscape  network associates  rsa data security  security dynamics  hp and verisign to address the internet security training needs of enterprises worldwide 
the company believes its development and marketing alliances offer it a number of competitive advantages  including early access to the vendor s software engineers and technical advisors for assistance in developing courses on new products 
with the approval of the development partner  products developed under the relationship can be identified as authorized by that software vendor  which the company believes improves the marketability of such courses 
in addition  these alliances may result in additional distribution channels for the company  by allowing each party to distribute courses to its respective customer base 
in some of these alliances  the software vendor has contributed financial resources toward the development of specified courses 
the company has recognized the revenue from such development payments on a percentage of completion basis as products are produced or  where required in the contract  as the company has met specified milestones 
the company believes that these alliances also provide significant benefits to the software vendors by allowing them to achieve additional market penetration generated by increasing the base of trained users 
the company believes that an increasing proportion of its revenues in the future may be attributable to products developed through its alliances 
there can be no assurance that any of these parties will continue to cooperate with the company  that the company will be able to develop successfully courses for its development and marketing alliances in a timely fashion or at all  or that the company will be able to negotiate additional alliances in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that the marketing efforts of the company s partners will not disrupt the company s direct sales efforts 
in addition  the company s development and marketing partners could pursue their existing or alternative training programs in preference to and in competition with those being developed with the company 
in the event that the company is not able to maintain or expand its current development and marketing alliances or enter into new development and marketing alliances  the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  the company is required to pay royalties to its development and marketing partners on products developed with them  which reduces the company s gross margins 
the company expects that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including the mix of titles licensed between titles developed exclusively by cbt group and royalty bearing titles developed pursuant to development and marketing alliances and the timing of expenses associated with development and marketing alliances 
in addition  the collaborative nature of the development process under these alliances may result in longer development times and less control over the timing of product introductions than for courses developed solely by the company 
customers the company primarily licenses its courses to fortune companies and other major us and international organizations in a wide range of industries  including manufacturing  transportation  this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
the company s actual future performance  including that attributable to its alliances  may not meet the company s current expectations 
investors are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled additional risk factors that could affect operating results commencing on page and discussions elsewhere in this annual report on form k of the factors that could affect future performance 
telecommunications  utilities  banking  healthcare  securities  computers and insurance 
cbt group also licenses its courseware to educational institutions and governmental agencies 
the company markets its courseware through its direct sales organization to almost  corporate customers worldwide 
the company also distributes its courses through a number of resellers 
no customer accounted for more than of revenues in  although a single customer can account for a significantly higher percentage of the company s quarterly revenues 
accordingly  failure to achieve a forecasted sale on schedule can have and did have in the third quarter of a material adverse effect on quarterly operating results 
backlog the company generates a substantial portion of its revenue through multi year license agreements 
the initial annual license fee is generally recognized at the time of delivery of products 
subsequent annual license fees are generally recognized on the anniversary date of such delivery  or if the customer exchanges courses at the anniversary date  upon delivery of the exchanged courses 
backlog at any given date represents the amount of all license fees under current agreements which have not yet been recognized as revenue 
although the company s license agreements are generally noncancellable by their terms  there can be no assurance that any customer will fulfill the contractual obligations under its agreement 
cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or shipments to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the amount and timing of the recognition of revenue associated with this backlog can vary depending on the timing of future deliveries of products and amendments to customers license agreements 
the company had backlog of approximately million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
approximately of the company s backlog as of december  was concentrated among fifteen customers  compared to among seven customers as of december  intellectual property and licenses the company regards its software as proprietary and relies primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect its proprietary rights 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s courseware or technology without authorization  or to develop similar courseware or technology independently 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which the company sells its products do not protect the company s software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the company generally does not include in its software any mechanisms to prevent or inhibit unauthorized use  but generally requires the execution of a license agreement which restricts copying and use of the company s products 
if unauthorized copying or misuse of the company s products were to occur to any substantial degree  the company s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim that the company s current or future products infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
the company expects that software developers will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in the it education and training industry grows and the functionality of products in the industry overlaps 
any such claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation or might require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
competition the it education and training market is highly fragmented and competitive  and the company expects this competition to increase 
the company expects that because of the lack of significant barriers to entry into the it education and training market  new competitors may enter the market in the future 
in addition  larger companies are competing with the company in the it education and training market through the acquisition of the company s competitors  and the company expects this trend to continue 
such competitors may also include publishing companies and vendors of application software  including those vendors with whom the company has formed development and marketing alliances 
the company competes primarily with third party suppliers of instructor led it education and training and internal training departments and other suppliers of it education and training  including several other companies that produce interactive software training 
to a lesser extent  the company also competes with consultants  value added resellers and network integrators 
certain of these value added resellers also market products competitive with those of the company 
the company expects that as organizations increase their dependence on outside suppliers of training  the company will face increasing competition from these other suppliers as it education and training managers more frequently compare training products provided by outside suppliers 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition  than the company 
in addition  the it education and training market is characterized by significant price competition  and the company expects that it may face increasing price pressures from competitors as is managers demand more value for their training budgets 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide products that compare favorably with new instructor led techniques or other interactive training software or that competitive pressures will not require the company to reduce its prices significantly 
sales and marketing direct sales and marketing at december   the company employed direct sales and marketing people worldwide  of which were located in the united states 
the company s telesales organization employed people worldwide  of whom were located in the united states  as of december  the company plans to continue to build the telesales organization in indirect sales in order to accelerate worldwide market penetration  the company is broadening its sales strategy by expanding its indirect sales channels  which include resellers  development partners  and industry catalogs circulated by leading it distributors 
the indirect sales channels give the company access to a more diverse client base  which the company believes cannot be targeted cost effectively through its direct sales force 
at december   the company employed indirect sales channel personnel 
the company s marketing partners also generally have the right to resell products developed under their alliances with the company

both mr 
mccabe and mr 
priest served on the interim management committee that had managed the company since october  and remain on the board of directors 
failure to retain these and other executives  or the loss of certain additional senior management personnel or other key employees  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and future business prospects 
the company s future success also depends on the continued service of its key management  sales  product development and additional operational personnel and on its ability to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in addition  the company depends on writers  programmers and graphic artists  as well as third party content providers 
the company expects to continue to hire additional product development  sales and marketing  is and accounting staff 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting  retaining or motivating key personnel 
in particular  the company s recent adverse operating results  stock price performance and management changes could create uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to attract and retain key personnel 
although the company has repriced all stock options other than stock options held by the company s directors in an effort to retain and reincent employees  there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful  and in any event  it will have a dilutive effect on future earnings per share

non us operations in  the company s products were marketed in over countries  and sales outside the united states represented approximately  and of the company s revenues in  and  respectively 
the company expects that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues and intends to continue to expand its operations outside of the united states 
in addition  the company s research and development organization is located outside the united states 
operations outside the united states are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in exchange rates  difficulties or delays in developing and supporting non english language versions of the company s products and services  political and economic conditions in various jurisdictions  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future operations outside of the united states 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in dollars  although several of the company s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the dollar  and a significant portion of the company s revenues  costs and assets are denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies

as a result of currency fluctuations  the company recognized net exchange gains of   and  in  and respectively 
during the company undertook hedging transactions against the irish pound because the company has substantial expenses denominated in that currency 
to date  the company has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of other currencies against the u 
s dollar  but may undertake such transactions in the future 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by the company would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
certain of the company s subsidiaries have significant operations and generate significant taxable income in ireland  and certain of the company s irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than tax rates in effect in the us and in other countries in which the company has operations 
if such subsidiaries were no longer to qualify for such tax rates or if the tax laws were rescinded or changed  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if tax authorities were to challenge successfully the manner in which profits are recognized among the company s subsidiaries  the company s taxes could increase  and its cash flow and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

irish stamp duty stamp duty  which is a tax on certain documents  is payable on all transfers of ordinary shares in companies registered in ireland wherever the instrument of transfer may be executed 
in the case of a transfer on sale  stamp duty will be charged at the rate of ir pounds for every ir pounds or part thereof of the amount or value of the consideration ie  purchase price 
where the consideration for the sale is expressed in a currency other than irish pounds  the duty will be charged on the irish pound equivalent calculated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transfer 
in the case of a transfer by way of gift subject to certain exceptions or for considerations less than the market value of the shares transferred  stamp duty will be charged at the above rate on such market value 
a transfer or issue of ordinary shares for deposit under the deposit agreement between cbt group  the bank of new york  as depositary  and the registered holders and the owners of a beneficial interest in book entry adrs in return for adrs will be similarly chargeable with stamp duty as will a transfer of ordinary shares from the depositary or the custodian upon surrender of an adr for the purpose of the withdrawal of the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement 
the irish revenue commissioners have issued a ruling to the company that transfers of adrs issued in respect of the company s shares will not be chargeable with irish stamp duty for so long as the adss are dealt in and quoted on the nasdaq national market 
it has been confirmed in section  finance act that transfers of adrs will be exempt from stamp duty where the adrs are dealt with in a recognized stock exchange

stamp duty is normally payable within days after the date of execution of the transfer 
late payment of stamp duty will result in liability to interest  penalties and fines 
volatility of stock price the company s initial public offering of the adss the ipo was completed in april  and there can be no assurance that a viable public market for the adss will be sustained 
the market price of the adss has fluctuated significantly since the ipo 
the company believes that factors such as announcements of developments related to the company s or its competitors business  announcements of new products or enhancements by the company or its competitors  sales of the adss into the public market  developments in the company s relationships with its customers  partners and distributors  shortfalls or changes in revenues  gross margins  earnings or losses or other financial results from public market expectations  regulatory developments  fluctuations in results of operations and general conditions in the company s market or the markets served by the company s customers or the economy could cause the price of the adss to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
for example  the company s revenue for the quarter ended september  did not increase at a rate comparable to prior quarters 
as a direct result  the trading price of the company s adss decreased rapidly and significantly  having an extreme adverse effect on the value of an investment in the company s securities 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the adss will not continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to the company s performance

beginning in fiscal  the company adopted statement of position software revenue recognition as amended by statement of position the effect of adoption did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company derives its revenues primarily pursuant to license agreements under which customers license usage of delivered products for a period of one  two or three years 
on each anniversary date during the term of multi year license agreements  customers are generally allowed to exchange any or all of the licensed products for an equivalent number of alternative products within the cbt group library 
the first year license fee is generally recognized as revenue at the time of delivery of all products  provided the company s fees are fixed or determinable and collections of accounts receivable are probable 
subsequent annual license fees are recognized on each anniversary date  provided the company s fees are fixed or determinable and collections of accounts receivable are probable 
the cost of satisfying any post contract support pcs is accrued at the time revenue is recognized  as pcs fees are included in the annual license fee  the estimated cost of providing pcs during the agreements is insignificant and unspecified upgrades or enhancements offered have been and are expected to be minimal and infrequent 
for multi element agreements vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to the undelivered elements of the agreement 
in addition  the company derives revenues from sales of its products  which is recognized upon shipment  net of allowances for estimated future returns and for excess quantities in distribution channels  provided the company s fees are fixed or determinable and collections of accounts receivable are probable 
in recent years  the company has entered into several development and marketing alliances with key vendors of client server software under which the company develops titles for training on specific products 
under certain of its development and marketing alliances  the company s partners have agreed to fund certain product development costs 
the company recognizes such funding as revenues on a percentage of completion basis  and the costs associated with such revenues are reflected as cost of revenues 
these agreements have the effect of shifting expenses associated with developing certain new products from research and development to cost of revenues 
the company expects that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including  but not limited to  the timing of expenses associated with development and marketing alliances 
the company does not expect funding from development partners to contribute significantly to revenues in future years 
recent developments on december  the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire knowledge well ltd 
and knowledge well group ltd 
collectively  knowledge well  providers of business  management and professional education using interactive learning technologies 
knowledge well s software titles are delivered using advanced interactive learning methodologies  while requiring that the student only have access to basic  industry standard computing platforms 
knowledge well s strategy is to provide a self paced education and training solution allowing individuals to obtain degrees and or other credentials 
this ageement has been amended and restated on march   to reflect certain changes agreed upon december  as a result of the decision to account for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the acquisition of knowledge well has been approved by an independent committee of cbt group s board of directors  in view of the fact that certain members of the board of directors of cbt group are shareholders and or former officers of knowledge well  and by the shareholders of knowledge well 
the acquisition is subject to specified closing conditions  including approval by the disinterested shareholders of cbt group and the receipt of required regulatory approvals 
the acquisition has been structured as a stock for stock exchange  in which a total of approximately million cbt group shares will be issued in exchange for all outstanding shares of knowledge well 
cbt group will also assume options to acquire knowledge well stock exercisable for an issuance of up to approximately million cbt group shares 
the successful combination of cbt group and knowledge well  including the successful operation of knowledge well as an autonomous subsidiary of cbt group  will require substantial effort from each company 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have an adverse impact on cbt group s ability to realize the full benefits of the acquisition 
the successful combination of the two companies will also require coordination of their research and development and sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  the process of combining the two organizations could cause the interruption of  or loss of momentum in  knowledge well s activities 
there can be no assurance that cbt group will be able to retain knowledge well s technical  sales and customer support personnel  or that it will realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the acquisition of knowledge well will result in an increase of the company s research and development  general and administrative and other expenses as a result of combining the operations of the company and knowledge well 
the acquisition may also increase the company s revenue to the extent knowledge well s products generate incremental revenue 
the company estimates that the negotiation and implementation of the acquisition will result in aggregate pre tax expenses of approximately million  primarily relating to costs associated with combining the companies and the fees of attorneys  accountants and the financial advisor to the company s independent committee 
although the company does not believe that the costs will significantly exceed the aforementioned amount  there can be no assurance that the company s estimate is correct or that unanticipated contingencies that will substantially increase the costs of combining the operations of the company and knowledge well will not occur 
in addition  the company intends to account for the acquisition of knowledge well under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
under this method of accounting  the purchase price will be allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the time of the closing of the acquisition 
the company intends to record a non cash expense of approximately million with respect to the write off of in process research and development acquired 
in any event  the company anticipates that costs associated with the acquisition of knowledge well and the write off of acquired in process research and development and goodwill amortization will negatively impact results of operations in the quarter in which the acquisition closes 
in addition  the amortization of acquired intangible assets will negatively impact results of operations in future quarters 
annual results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the three years in the period ended december  years ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative acquired research and development costs of acquisitions total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income this paragraph consists of forward looking statements reflecting current expectations 
the amount of the expense to be recorded with respect to the write off of acquired in process research and development is based on a current intention  and the amount actually recorded may be reduced 
if such amount is reduced  the effect on the results of operations for the quarter in which the acquisition closes will be correspondingly reduced  and the effect of the amortization of acquired intangible assets on results of operations in future quarters will be correspondingly increased 
in addition  the company s actual future performance may not meet the company s current expectations 
investors are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled additional risk factors that could affect operating results commencing on page and discussions elsewhere in this annual report on form k of the factors that could affect future performance 
revenues revenues increased from million in to million in and to million in  increases of and in and compared to the corresponding prior years of and respectively 
the increases in revenues during these periods were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of available courses  customer contract renewals and upgrades and expanded marketing and distribution efforts 
during the three month periods ended september  and december   the company experienced a slowdown in the historical quarterly revenue growth rate due in part to a decline in contract renewals and upgrades and significant new contracts were also impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the volatility of the company s stock price during the final weeks of september in addition some contracts that were signed in the six month period ending december  generated less revenue than had historically been the case 
also  the company s channel businesses  including the corporate telesales operations  did not perform as well as had been anticipated 
there can be no assurance that the issues that adversely affected revenues in the third and fourth quarters of will not continue to negatively affect the company s revenues in the future 
revenues in the united states increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and to million or of revenues in the increases in and were primarily the result of significant increases in the number of sales and related personnel employed in the united states  an increase in the number of available courses and an expansion of the company s customer base 
while revenues in the united states increased significantly in absolute terms over these periods  the company s sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses in the united states also increased rapidly as the company hired and expanded its staff to support the us sales growth 
revenues in the united kingdom were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in  respectively 
revenues in ireland were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in and million or of revenues in  respectively 
revenues from countries outside the united states  united kingdom and ireland principally from australia  europe other than ireland and the united kingdom  canada  south africa and mideast in were million or of revenues in  million or of revenues in  and million or of revenues in  respectively 
because a significant portion of the company s business is conducted outside the united states  the company is subject to numerous risks of doing business in other countries  including risks related to currency fluctuations 
no customer accounted for more than of revenues in  or  although a single customer can account for a significantly higher percentage of the company s quarterly revenues 
accordingly  failure to achieve a forecasted sale on schedule can have and did have in the third quarter of a material adverse effect on quarterly operating results 
approximately of the company s backlog at december  was concentrated among customers  compared to among seven customers at december  backlog at any given date represents the amount of all license fees under current agreements  which have not yet been recognized as revenues 
although the company s license agreements are noncancellable by their terms  there can be no assurance that any customer will fulfill the contractual obligations under its agreement 
cancellation  reduction or delay in orders by or shipments to any of these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the cost of materials such as compact discs  diskettes  packaging and documentation  royalties to third parties  the portion of development costs associated with funded development projects and fulfillment costs 
gross margins increased from in to in and to in gross margins have been increasing as a result of the inclusion in the earlier periods of royalty payments by acquired companies to third party providers  which were higher than the average royalty payments paid by cbt group 
products previously provided by such acquired companies are being replaced by cbt group product 
the company expects that cost of revenues may fluctuate from period to period in the future based upon many factors  including the mix of titles licensed between titles developed exclusively by cbt group and royalty bearing titles developed pursuant to development and marketing alliances and the timing of expenses associated with development and marketing alliances 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  related overhead costs  travel expenses and fees paid to outside consultants 
research and development expenses increased in absolute terms from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and to million or of revenues in  principally as a result of an increase in research and development personnel employed to expand and enhance the company s library of software products 
the company delivered new titles during  which brought the company s library of titles to  representing a increase over the number of titles at the end of fiscal the increase in fiscal is attributable to the expansion of the company s dublin development center  partially offset by a reduction in the research and development expenses at forefront following the merger in may the decrease in in the research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues was a result of the reorganization of forefront s research and development facility for internet content management products in april compared to when forefront made significant investments in research and development efforts relating to internet content management products 
in addition  approximately   and  of development expenses incurred in connection with development and marketing alliances were charged to cost of revenues in  and  respectively 
the company believes that significant investment in research and development is required to remain competitive in the it education and training market  and the company therefore expects research and development expenses to continue to increase in future periods 
software development costs are accounted for in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 under which the company is required to capitalize software development costs after technological feasibility has been established 
to date  development costs after establishment of technological feasibility have been immaterial  and all software development costs have been expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  travel expenses  advertising and promotional expenses and related overhead costs 
these expenses increased in absolute terms from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and to million or of revenues in the increases in sales and marketing expenses are primarily attributable to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel to accommodate the expected growth in operation in the united states and to a lesser extent outside the united states 
commission costs have also increased in absolute terms along with the increases in revenues during these periods 
in and  the company increased significantly advertising and promotional expenses to market the company s expanded library of titles 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues was negatively impacted by the less than expected sequential revenue growth for the third and fourth quarters of the company expects to increase sales and marketing expenses in the future to support expansion of its sales and marketing efforts 
this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
the company s actual future performance may not meet the company s current expectations or its current plans may change 
investors are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled additional risk factors that could affect operating results commencing on page and discussions elsewhere in this annual report on form k of the factors that could affect future performance 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  travel expenses  legal  accounting and consulting fees and related overhead costs for administrative officers and support personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute terms from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and to million or of revenues in the increases were primarily due to increased staffing and infrastructure to support expanding operations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in was due to the increase in staffing and infrastructure to facilitate revenue growth  which was less than that which was anticipated 
the decrease as a percentage of revenues from to was due principally to more rapid increases in revenues than in associated expenses during the company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods due to increases in staffing and infrastructure 
acquired research and development acquired research and development expenses increased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and decreased to nil in the acquired research and development was incurred by the acquisitions by forefront of blue squirrel inc in  lan professional corporation and bookmaker corporation in these amounts are included in the company s results under the pooling method of accounting rules in accordance with the us gaap 
costs of acquisitions costs of acquisitions decreased from million or of revenues in to million or of revenues in and increased to million or of revenues in the acquisition expenses incurred in were due to the acquisitions of cls and ntt by the company and the acquisition of blue squirrel  inc by forefront 
the acquisition expenses incurred in were due to the acquisitions of ala  benelux  scholars and mid east by the company and the acquisitions of bookmaker corporation  all micro  inc and lan professional corporation by forefront 
the acquisition expenses incurred in related to the acquisition of forefront  accounted for as a pooling of interests 
these expenses consisted primarily of professional fees  such as investment banking  legal and accounting  severance costs  closure of offices  goodwill and other intangibles written off following the closure of certain business segments and other related costs in connection with the acquisitions 
the company may incur additional acquisition expenses in the future should it undertake additional acquisitions 
other income  net other income  net  comprises interest income  interest expense  gain or loss on sale of assets and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
the company recognized other income  net  of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in other income  net in is a one time gain on the sale by forefront of internet printing technology of million 
excluding this one time gain on sale of assets in  the increase in other income  net was due principally to an increase of million in interest income in as compared to this increase in interest income resulted from interest on increased cashflows from financing and operations 
in addition  the company recognized net exchange gains of   and  in  and respectively 
this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
the company s actual future performance may not meet the company s current expectations or its current plans may change 
investors are strongly encouraged to review the section entitled additional risk factors that could affect operating results commencing on page and discussions elsewhere in this annual report on form k of the factors that could affect future performance 
the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in dollars  although several of the company s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the dollar  and a significant portion of the company s and its subsidiaries revenues  costs and assets are denominated in currencies other than their respective functional currencies 
the company has significant subsidiaries in the united kingdom  australia  the netherlands  canada and germany whose functional currencies are their local currencies and the majority of whose sales and operating expenses other than cost of goods sold are denominated in their respective local currencies 
in addition  the company s irish subsidiaries  whose functional currency is the us dollar  incur substantial operating expenses denominated in irish pounds 
fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  particularly its operating margins  and could result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the company s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
the company s subsidiaries in the united kingdom  the netherlands  australia  and canada whose functional currencies are their local currencies  had unhedged liabilities denominated in us dollars payable to cbt ireland at december  of million  million  million and million respectively 
during  the company undertook hedging transactions against the irish pound because the company has substantial expenses denominated in that currency 
to date  the company has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of other currencies against the u 
s dollar  but may undertake such transactions in the future 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by the company would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
other income  net may fluctuate in future periods as a result of movements in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and asset disposals 
provision for income taxes cbt group plc operates as a holding company with operating subsidiaries in several countries  and each subsidiary is taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates 
because taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot be used to offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other tax jurisdictions  the company s consolidated effective tax rate may increase to the extent that the company reports tax losses in some subsidiaries and taxable income in others 
the company has significant operations and generates a majority of its taxable income in the republic of ireland  and certain of the company s irish operating subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than tax rates in effect in the united states and other countries in which the company has operations 
one irish subsidiary currently qualifies for a tax rate and another irish subsidiary is income tax exempt 
if such subsidiaries were no longer to qualify for such tax rates or if the tax laws were rescinded or changed  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the standard rate of irish corporation tax on both trading and non trading income presently from january  is 
the incentive rate referred to above applies in respect of income derived from certain activities carried out in the republic of ireland 
the incentive rate will continue up to december  commencing january   it has been confirmed by the government of ireland in an announcement by the irish minister for finance on december   the corporation tax rate is expected to be on trading income and on non trading income 
moreover  because the company incurs income tax in several countries  an increase in the profitability of the company in one or more of these countries could result in a higher overall tax rate 
in addition  if tax authorities were to challenge successfully the manner in which profits are recognized among the company s subsidiaries  the company s taxes could increase and its cash flow and net income could be materially adversely affected 
the company s provision for income taxes was million  million and million for each of  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the company was  and in  and  respectively 
the movement in the effective tax rate was principally the result of losses incurred by pooled entities in both and  which were not available to offset taxable income earned in the same or other jurisdictions pre or post the merger 
in particular  forefront had losses of million in and million in  which could not be offset  thus resulting in an increased overall tax rate for those years

other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income the company s growth in revenues over the last eight quarters has been primarily attributable to an increase in the number of available courses in the company s library  an increase in the number of customers and increases in sales to existing customers  as well as the company s expanded marketing and distribution efforts in the united states  and to a lesser extent  countries outside the united states 
during the three month periods ended september  and december   the company experienced a slowdown in the historical quarterly revenue growth rate due in part to a decline in contract renewals and upgrades and significant new contracts were also impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the volatility of the company s stock price during the final weeks of september  in addition some contracts that were signed in the six month period ending december  generated less revenue than had historically been the case 
also  the company s channel businesses  including the corporate telesales operations  did not perform as well as had been anticipated 
there can be no assurance that the issues that adversely affected revenues in the third and fourth quarters of will not continue to negatively affect the company s revenues in the future 
in  the company experienced a slowdown in the historical quarterly revenue growth rate for the quarters ended september  and december  the company s revenues historically have been highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
there can be no assurance that the issues that adversely affected revenues in the third and fourth quarters of will not continue to negatively affect the company s net income in the future 
during  the company hired a number of employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  which resulted in an increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year 
the company also added a significant number of employees to research and development 
as a result of these increases  as well as continued hiring in other departments  the company expects operating expenses in future periods to be significantly higher than in prior periods 
the company anticipates that it will continue this hiring in the first half of  which will reduce operating margins  particularly in the first and second quarters 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
working capital was million  million and million as of december   and respectively 
the increases in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital in and were due principally to net income and the proceeds from the exercise of options  which were offset by investments in property and equipment to support the company s expanded operations 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from million in to million in and increased to million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable in at december  accounts receivable had increased by million as compared with the accounts receivable balance at december  this increase was due primarily to the revenue earned in the quarter ended december  of million as compared to revenue of million for the quarter ended december  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily attributable to a significantly lower increase in accounts receivable than in the accounts receivable balance at december  increased by million from that at december  the significantly lower increase in accounts receivable compared to the increase in  can be attributed to the revenue generated in the quarter ended december  of million compared to in the corresponding quarter of the increase in accounts receivable balance is primarily a function of the revenue earned in the preceeding quarter and the timing of payments in respect of receivables 
accounts receivable write offs in an accounting year to date have not been material and have been within the amounts reserved 
capital expenditures were approximately million in  million in and million in the increases in were primarily attributable to expenditures relating to computer equipment and infrastructure as a result of investments in the companys information systems and capital expenditures on new corporate headquarters in redwood city  california  a new facility in scottsdale  arizona and the new research and development facilities in dublin  ireland 
the company expects that its capital expenditure will increase in  primarily as a result of continuing investments in its information systems and expenditures on the new research and development facility 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company may from time to time consider the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies  which may require additional financing

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the sop requires the capitalization of certain costs incurred after the date of adoption in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use once certain criteria are met 
the company adopted sop in fiscal in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no  employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits 
this statement revises employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefit plans 
it does not  however  change the measurement of recognition of those plans 
this statement standardizes the disclosure requirements for pensions and other post retirement benefits to the extent practicable  requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations and fair values of plan assets that will facilitate financial analysis  and eliminates certain disclosures 
restatement of disclosures for earlier periods is required 
the company has implemented the provisions of sfas in for its defined contribution plan 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity sfas which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the company has yet to determine its date of adoption 
the statement will require the company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges of underlying transactions must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
management has not yet determined what the effect of sfas will be on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the aicpa issued sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and addresses software revenue recognition as it applies to certain multiple element arrangements 
sop also amends sop  deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop through fiscal years beginning on or before march  all other provisions of sop are effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after march  additional risk factors that could affect operating results in addition to the other factors identified in this annual report  the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect the company s future operating results  and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in the company s forward looking statements relating to its business 
fluctuations in operating results the company has in the past experienced fluctuations in its quarterly operating results and anticipates that such fluctuations will continue and could intensify in the future 
fluctuations in operating results may result in volatility in the price of the company s adss 
for example  the company s revenue for the quarter ended september  did not increase at a rate comparable to prior quarters 
as a direct result  the trading price of the company s adss decreased rapidly and significantly  having an extreme adverse effect on the value of an investment in the company s securities 
although the company was profitable in each of the last ten quarters  there can be no assurance that such profitability will continue in the future or that the levels of profitability will not vary significantly among quarterly periods 
the company s operating results may fluctuate as a result of many factors  including size and timing of orders and shipments  mix of sales between products developed solely by the company and products developed through development and marketing alliances  royalty rates  the announcement  introduction and acceptance of new products  product enhancements and technologies by the company and its competitors  mix of sales between the company s field sales force  its other direct sales channels and its indirect sales channels  competitive conditions in the industry  loss of significant customers  delays in availability of existing or new products  spending patterns of the company s customers  litigation costs and expenses  currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
the company s expense levels are based in significant part on its expectations regarding future revenues and are fixed to a large extent in the short term 
accordingly  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
any significant revenue shortfall would therefore have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
this risk materialized in the third and fourth quarters of  where profit was dramatically negatively affected by a shortfall in revenues as against management s expectations 
dependence on key personnel on october   mr 
james j 
buckley  the company s chairman and chief executive officer  and mr 
richard y 
okumoto  the company s senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer  stepped down from their respective positions 
messrs 
buckley and okumoto were replaced on an interim basis by a newly formed management committee 
effective december  the company appointed mr 
william g 
mccabe as chairman of the board and mr 
gregory m 
priest as president and chief executive officer 
both mr 
mccabe and mr 
priest served on the interim management committee that had managed the company since october  and remain on the board of directors 
failure to retain these and other executives  or the loss of certain additional senior management personnel or other key employees  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and future business prospects 
the company s future success also depends on the continued service of its key sales  product development and additional operational personnel and on its ability to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in addition  the company depends on writers  programmers and graphic artists  as well as third party content providers 
the company expects to continue to hire additional product development  sales and marketing  is and accounting staff 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting  retaining or motivating key personnel 
in particular  the company s recent adverse operating results  stock price performance and management changes could create uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to attract and retain key personnel 
although the company has repriced all stock options other than stock options held by the company s directors in an effort to retain and reincent employees  there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful  and in any event  it will have a dilutive effect on future earnings per share 
the inability to hire and retain qualified personnel or the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s current business  new product development efforts and future business prospects 
competition the it education and training market is highly fragmented and competitive  and the company expects this competition to increase 
the company expects that because of the lack of significant barriers to entry into this market  new competitors may enter the market in the future 
in addition  larger companies are competing with the company in the it education and training market  in part through the acquisition of the company s competitors  and the company expects this trend to continue 
such competitors may also include publishing companies and vendors of application software  including those vendors with whom the company has formed development and marketing alliances 
the company competes primarily with third party suppliers of instructor led it education and training and internal training departments and with other suppliers of it education and training  including several other companies that produce interactive software training 
to a lesser extent  the company also competes with consultants  value added resellers and network integrators 
certain of these value added resellers also market products competitive with those of the company 
the company expects that as organizations increase their dependence on outside suppliers of training  the company will face increasing competition from these other suppliers as it education and training managers more frequently compare training products provided by outside suppliers 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition  than the company 
in addition  the it education and training market is characterized by significant price competition  and the company expects that it will face increasing price pressures from competitors as is managers demand more value for their training budgets 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide products that compare favorably with new instructor led techniques or other interactive training software or that competitive pressures will not require the company to reduce its prices significantly 
developing market the market for it education and training is rapidly evolving 
new methods of delivering interactive education software are being developed and offered in the marketplace  including intranet and internet deployment and management systems 
many of these new delivery and training management systems will involve new and different business models and contracting mechanisms 
in addition  multimedia and other product functionality features are being added to the educational software 
accordingly  cbt s future success will depend upon  among other factors  the extent to which cbt is able to develop and implement products which address these emerging market requirements 
there can be no assurance that cbt will be successful in meeting changing market needs 
seasonality the software industry generally  and the company in particular  are subject to seasonal revenue fluctuations  based in part on customers annual budgetary cycles and in part on the annual nature of sales quotas 
these seasonal trends have in the past caused  and in the future are expected to continue to cause  revenues in the first quarter of a year to be less  perhaps substantially so  than revenues for the immediately preceding fourth quarter 
in addition  the company has in past years added significant headcount in the sales and marketing and research and development functions in the first quarter  and to a lesser extent  the second quarter 
because these headcount additions do not immediately contribute significant revenues  the company s operating margins in the earlier part of the year tend to be significantly lower than in the later parts of the year 
because of the issues affecting the company s third and fourth quarter results  which will continue to negatively affect the company for at least the next several quarters  the reduction in operating margins is expected to continue for at least the next several quarters 
many software companies also experience a seasonal downturn in demand during the summer months 
there can be no assurance that these or other seasonal trends will not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
economic conditions the revenue growth and profitability of the company s business depends on the overall demand for computer software and services as well as new developments within the it industry 
the demand for computer software and services is dependent on general economic and business conditions 
thus  a weakening of the global economy could result in decreased revenues or decelerating growth rates 
management of expanding operations and acquisitions the company has recently experienced rapid expansion of its operations  which has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on the company s administrative  operational and financial personnel and systems 
the company s future operating results will substantially depend on the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve its operational  financial control and reporting systems 
in particular  the company requires significant improvement in its order entry and fulfillment and management information systems in order to support its expanded operations 
if the company is unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as a result of the consummation of a number of acquisitions the company s operating expenses have increased 
there can be no assurance that the integration of these businesses can be successfully completed in a timely fashion  or at all  or that the revenues from the acquired businesses will be sufficient to support the costs associated with those businesses  without adversely affecting the company s operating margins 
any failure to successfully complete the integration in a timely fashion or to generate sufficient revenues from the acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
on may   the company acquired the forefront group  inc  a houston based provider of high quality  cost effective  computer based training products and network utilities for technical professionals 
the successful combination of cbt and forefront  including the operation of forefront as an autonomous subsidiary of cbt  has required and will continue to require substantial effort from each company 
the company has experienced some difficulties in the integration of forefront and cbt  in particular in connection with the integration of the two companies sales operations 
these difficulties contributed to the company s failure to achieve its internal revenue expectations in the third quarter of and have continued to affect the company since that time 
these difficulties could continue to have a negative effect on future results  which could be material 
in addition to the pending acquisition of knowledge well  the company regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities and is likely to make acquisitions in the future 
future acquisitions by the company could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
product and technology acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience and the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies 
the company s management has had limited experience in assimilating acquired organizations and products into the company s operations 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of the company to integrate successfully any operations  personnel or products that have been acquired or that might be acquired in the future  and the failure of the company to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
risk of increasing taxes certain of the company s subsidiaries have significant operations and generate significant taxable income in ireland  and certain of the company s irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than tax rates in effect in the united states and in other countries in which the company has operations 
the extent of the tax benefit could vary from period to period  and there can be no assurance that the company s tax situation will not change 
euro currency the participating members of the european union adopted the euro as the common legal currency on january  on that same date they established the fixed conversion rates between the existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the company s research and development operation  as well as a number of sales operations  are based in europe 
the company does not believe that the euro conversion will have a material impact on its business and financial condition 
however the company is unable to determine with certainty if the euro conversion will have a material adverse impact on the company s business and financial condition 
year in the past  many information technology products were designed with two digit year codes that are unable to determine the correct century for a particular year 
as a result  these hardware and software products may not function or may give incorrect results in and beyond the year this problem has been generally referred to as the year problem 
the company has established a year task force in its dublin development centre the dublin task force and a year task force in its corporate headquarters in redwood city  california the us task force to together identify and resolve year issues 
the dublin task force is testing the year readiness of cbt s current software products and making appropriate modifications to ensure that cbt s software will function appropriately in  the year  and throughout the next century 
the dublin task force is also testing the company s internal systems in ireland 
the us task force is coordinating testing and preparation of the company internal systems throughout the world that are material to cbt s operations 
the company has defined year ready to mean that neither performance nor functionality of the hardware or software product will be negatively affected by four digit dates prior to  during  and after the year in a material manner provided that all other products whether hardware or software used in or in combination with the product properly exchange data with it 
the company is utilizing internal resources to identify  test and as necessary correct or reprogram its products and services for year readiness 
the company has tested almost all of its current products that are generally available and has determined that all such products are year ready  except for certain older products that the company does not plan to make year ready and for which there is presently relatively small demand such as dos based products 
the company has not specifically tested software obtained from third parties  which is incorporated in cbt s products  but plans to seek assurances from these third parties that their software is year ready 
despite the company s testing or assurances from third party software providers  there can be no assurances that the company s products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions which may result in delay or loss of revenue  diversion of development resources  damage to the company s reputation  costs for third party damage claims  or increased service costs any of which could impair the company s finances or business prospects 
the company is utilizing internal resources to identify  correct  replace or reprogram  and test its internal systems  including both information technology it and non it systems 
the company has not yet determined whether any external resources will be required 
the company s year internal readiness program primarily covers taking inventory of hardware  software and embedded systems  creating action plans to address known risks associated with such systems  contacting vendors for assurances that their systems are or shall be timely year ready  and contingency planning 
the company has initiated an assessment of its material internal it systems and its non it systems 
there can be no assurance that the company s internal systems or the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely year ready and that such failure to achieve year readiness will not have a material adverse effect on the company s systems 
the company has thus far funded its year readiness plan from operating cash flows and in the past has not separately accounted for these costs 
these costs have principally been the related payroll costs for personnel in the development and information systems group 
the company estimates that costs incurred through december  in connection with the year readiness program have not been material to the company 
in connection with the company s internal system year readiness plan  the company will incur additional costs which may be material for internal and possibly external administrative personnel to manage the project  and for new or upgrades to internal use software  hardware and related engineering costs 
although the company expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to adequately address issues confronting the company raised by the year problem  there can be no assurance  however  that problems will not arise with respect to year readiness that the company fails to identify or address timely 
the company s inability to timely implement such changes could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year readiness issues  and the company is aware of lawsuits against other software vendors 
in addition  the company could be affected by year litigation against its software development partners 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation and unknown impact of the year problem  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such litigation 
the company presently has only minimal information concerning the year readiness status of its customers 
if the company s current or future customers fail to achieve year readiness or if they divert or delay technology expenditures to focus on or in connection with preparing their business for the year  capital expenditure  software investment and training budgets may be delayed or spent on remediation efforts rather than information technology training 
such a delay in software investment or diversion of software investment or training funds could reduce the demand for the company s products both a directly  if current and potential customers allocate less funds to information technology training  and b indirectly  by delaying the purchase and implementation of new systems 
this could adversely affect the company s future revenues  although the impact is not known at this time 
the company has facilities  operations  and customers located throughout the world 
some commentators have reported that some countries  and organizations within those countries  are not acting intensively to remediate their year issues 
to the extent that the businesses and governments in countries where the company does business do not work intensively at remediation of their year issues  the company may suffer significant interruptions or delays in its operations and business 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
the company is also subject to external forces that might affect industry and commerce generally  such as year readiness failures at utility  transportation  telecommunication  and internet provider companies and related service interruptions 
in addition  because the company has facilities  operations  and customers located throughout the world  the company s operations and financial results may be impacted more severely than those of other businesses by the failure of its internal network or by the temporary loss of telecommunication systems or the internet generally 
the company has not yet developed a contingency plan to address situations that may result if it is unable to achieve year readiness of its critical operations 
the cost of developing or implementing such a plan may itself be material
