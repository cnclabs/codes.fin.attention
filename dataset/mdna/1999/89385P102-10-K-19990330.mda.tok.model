new accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  establishes new standards for recognizing all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  and measures those instruments at fair value 
the company will be required to adopt the new standard beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  earlier application is permitted 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this statement 
year general state of readiness transport america has instituted a steering committee the committee to assess the readiness of the company s systems to accommodate year yk issues 
the committee  consisting of senior management representing both technical and operating departments  is charged with developing a project plan  detailed management and remediation plans  as well as execution of these plans 
transport corporation of america  inc 
the company is currently dependent upon systems that are not yk compliant  including the company s operations system  which is critical to coordinate driver movements with customer needs and which interacts with other internal accounting and operating systems as well as external customer information systems 
development of a replacement operations system commenced in  and the coding and testing of this system is substantially complete 
training and implementation is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of the replacement system has been designed to provide operational capabilities and enhancements not present in the current systems  in addition to achieving yk compliance 
under the guidance of the committee  an inventory and assessment of all systems has been completed 
a remediation timeline for non compliant systems will be completed in the second quarter of the company is dependent upon system based relationships with outside parties  including customers  banks  payroll processors  suppliers  communication service providers  and other business partners 
the company has outlined its core business processes and identified customers and vendors who are critical to these processes 
the company has implemented a series of phone and printed surveys which have been sent to these business partners to assess their yk readiness 
responses to these surveys are being collected and assessments made to determine the degree of impact on company operations  should any of these outside parties fail to achieve yk compliance 
remediation actions and alternate procedures will be developed to overcome any significant business partner issues discovered as a result of the surveys 
costs to address the company s yk issues the company believes that the costs of addressing internal yk issues will not have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations or financial condition 
the major initiative  consisting of replacing the operations system  is primarily directed at improving operational effectiveness  with the added benefit of replacing a non yk compliant system 
the company has estimated that internal costs associated with yk compliance will be  of which approximately  has been incurred and expensed to date 
the potential financial impact on the company resulting from the failure of any of the company s business partners to be yk compliant cannot be estimated until the company has received and evaluated responses to its surveys of its business partners 
risks associated with the company s yk issues the company s failure to implement yk compliant systems could disrupt daily operations  impairing  for example  the company s ability to receive and record customer orders  coordinate driver movements  and invoice customers  all of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s results of operations and liquidity  if prolonged 
although the company believes alternate manual processes exist that could temporarily minimize the disruption caused by a yk failure  such processes would not likely be effective for a extended period of time 
transport corporation of america  inc 
the company is dependent upon third party resources which are outside its direct control 
among the more critical of these is the telecommunication system  upon which the company depends to receive customer orders and direct driver movements 
daily activities are very dependent upon voice based phone systems and satellite based communication systems 
failure of the voice based phone system would pose a critical loss of capabilities  only partially offset by satellite communication options 
several critical relationships exist between the company and its customers  particularly those who electronically initiate order transactions with the company or interact directly with the company s systems 
failure of the company s customers to achieve yk compliance could jeopardize the company s ability to transact business electronically with those customers 
in the event of a customer s yk failure  the success of manual interim processes will be largely out of the company s control 
contingency plans the company is in the process of developing a comprehensive yk contingency plan 
the committee is charged with developing such contingency plan by the end of the second quarter of seasonality as is typical in the truckload industry  the company s operations fluctuate seasonally according to customer shipping patterns which tend to peak in the summer and fall  then increase again after the holiday and winter seasons 
operating expenses also tend to be higher during the cold weather months  primarily due to poorer fuel economy and increased maintenance costs 
inflation many of the company s operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which could result in higher operating costs 
the effects of inflation on the company s business have not been significant during the last three years

the put gives the shareholder the right to sell some or all of the million shares of the company s common stock back to the company at per share  payable in cash  during a day period commencing june  transport corporation of america  inc
