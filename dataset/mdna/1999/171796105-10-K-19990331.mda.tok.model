general the company was founded in  and focused initially on contract manufacturing liquid effervescent products 
in september  patent claims were allowed on the company s orasolv registered trademark technology 
following issuance of the orasolv patent  cima changed its focus and emerged as a drug delivery company emphasizing primarily developing and manufacturing pharmaceutical products based upon orasolv 
orasolv is an oral dosage form which incorporates mircoencapsulated drug ingredients into a tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth without chewing or water and which effectively masks the taste of the medication being delivered 
additional drug delivery technologies are also under development by the company 
in early the company recorded its first commercial sales using the company s orasolv technology 
in  another otc product for a second partner was launched using the orasolv technology 
the company anticipates that the first prescription pharmaceutical product using the orasolv technology will be launched by one of its partners later in prior to this  the company s revenues had been from sales using the company s autolution a liquid effervescent technology  license fees paid by corporate partners in consideration of the transfer of rights under collaboration agreements  and product development fees paid by corporate partners to fund the company s research and development efforts for products developed under such agreements 
approximately of the company s total revenues through have been generated from development work and sales of autolution products 
the company does not anticipate that it will manufacture liquid effervescent products  and has not recognized any revenues from such products since over the last three years  approximately  of revenue has been generated from three major sources product development fees approximately of the total for work related to orasolv products  and to a lesser extent sales approximately of orasolv products and licensing revenues approximately related to orasolv products 
in addition to revenues from the above sources  the company has funded operations from private and public sales of equity securities  realizing net proceeds of approximately  from private sales of equity securities and  and  from the company s july initial public offering and may public offering of its common stock  respectively 
at december   the company had  shares of its common stock outstanding 
the company expects that losses will continue through at least  even though cima expects to be generating revenues from manufacturing  licensing arrangements  and product development fee related to orasolv products 
at december   the company had accumulated net losses of approximately  research and development expenses will increase as cima investigates new drug technologies  including the possibility of utilizing sublingual systems 
personnel costs for research and development are expected to increase as personnel will be needed to support the development programs for our new corporate partners and if efforts investigating new technologies prove to be successful 
as cima continues production  the company anticipates additional operations personnel may need to be added to meet corporate partners orders 
management expects administrative support to remain stable 
manufacturing infrastructure should not increase as there is capacity to meet short term production needs 
the company s ability to generate revenues is dependent upon its ability to develop new  innovative drug delivery technologies and to enter into and be successful in collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies for the development and manufacture of orasolv products and other technologies to be marketed by these corporate partners 
the company is highly dependent upon the efforts of the corporate partners to successfully market the products in the technologies developed by the company 
although the company believes their partners have and will continue to have an economic motivation to market these products vigorously  the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to marketing are not within the control of the company 
their partners independently could make material marketing and other commercialization decisions which could adversely affect the company s future revenue 
the company s revenues could vary materially from quarter to quarter due to the company having relatively few agreements with corporate partners  causing product development fees to fluctuate  and the fact that certain of the company s products are seasonal in nature and revenues could vary depending on corporate partners ordering patterns 
in recent years  the company has actively marketed its orasolv technology to the pharmaceutical industry 
the company is presently engaged in product development and manufacturing scale up efforts with several different pharmaceutical companies regarding a variety of potential products  with an emphasis on prescription products 
in the first quarter of  the company began commercial production for bristol myers squibb company bristol myers of the first product in the company s orasolv dosage form  which was officially launched in september in the second quarter of  the company expanded its relationship with bristol myers and signed a global non exclusive license agreement which covers multiple products 
in the third quarter of  the first two prescription product license option and development agreements were signed 
each agreement is for a product which is currently marketed by the company s partners  schering corporation schering plough and zeneca pharmaceuticals zeneca 
the product under development for zeneca is its new antimigraine compound zolmitriptan zomig registered trademark 
in the third quarter of  the development and option agreement with schering plough was amended to extend the previously executed agreement 
in october of  the company and smithkline beecham terminated their license agreement related to an otc product 
the company continues to focus its efforts on the development of prescription pharmaceuticals 
in the fourth quarter of  the development and license option agreement was signed with novartis which has been converted to exclusive license and supply agreements effective july  in the third quarter  sales are recorded to novartis for shipment of triaminic registered trademark softchews registered trademark for a regional launch 
in the fourth quarter  the company signed its third prescription product license option and development agreement with organon 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these activities or discussions will result in the eventual marketing of products using orasolv or the company s other technologies 
the company has substantially completed the assessment of the impact that the year date conversion may have on its internal systems and software  including information technology it and non it  or embedded technology systems 
the company believes its risks relating to year problems in its systems to be very low  as its it systems are relatively small and predominately new and its software consists entirely of off the shelf packages for which year compliant upgrades are available and have largely already been implemented 
the company s engineers also believe that its non it systems will not experience adverse effects from the year date conversion 
the company has designated an individual to oversee year compliance  and has implemented a plan to ensure that during the company will have upgraded each of its software packages to versions  or have converted to a replacement package  that the vendors thereof claim to be free of year problems 
the company plans to replace any hardware that may be affected by the year date conversion  or alter its use to one not sensitive to year issues 
the company has spent to date approximately  on software upgrades and expects the total expenditure for such upgrades to be less than  the company has largely completed is replacement or reallocation of hardware that may present year concerns  and estimates the total cost of any such replacement to be less than  the company spent approximately  during the fourth quarter of to hire a consultant to review the company s plans and actions relating to year compliance 
the review indicated that the consultant believed there were no major risks to the company 
the company believes that its risks related to year compliance of its internal systems to be immaterial 
the company has also initiated discussions with its corporate partners to determine that those parties have appropriate plans to remediate year issues 
to date  none of the company s partners has indicated significant concerns about their ability to do so 
however  a substantial negative impact of year issues on one of the company s few large corporate partners that significantly affects the partner s ability to do business could have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial condition of the company 
results of operations years ended december   and the company s results of operations for the year ended december   includes the sales of an additional otc product in the marketplace in the united states that uses the orasolv technology and significant revenues for prescription product development work from our partners 
in  product sales were  these sales were preliminary for novartis test market of triaminic registered trademark softchews registered trademark and to a lesser extent for mead johnson canada for tempra firstabs 
in  product sales decreased compared to product sales that were  management believes that the sales  which primarily were for bristol myers launch of tempra registered trademark quicklets tm  were for quantities greater than a one year period 
the company expects that its current product development efforts will result in additional commercial production in the near future 
in  product sales were zero as the company ceased to manufacture liquid effervescent products  as contract manufacturing was de emphasized 
product development fees and licensing revenues were   and  in  and  respectively 
this increase in fees and revenues is a reflection of the progress of the company s development agreements and expansion of relationships in the prescription pharmaceutical marketplace 
in  revenues and fees from novartis consumer health  zeneca and schering plough represented over of the total 
the company continues to have relatively few agreements with corporate partners and  therefore  it expects that these revenues and fees will tend to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis 
in  cost of goods sold were  as compared to  in this decrease is directly related to the decreased production levels and lower product sales in as compared to as noted earlier  the company expects that its current product development efforts will result in increased production levels  and therefore  it expects that costs of sales to increase in the near future 
in  cost of goods sold were zero as there was no commercial production 
any fixed cost for the production facility were considered development expenses  and as such were recorded as research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in  as compared to  is directly related to the increased product development fees earned in this included increased payroll and related costs in research and development in to support these product development projects  and efforts on new technologies 
the decrease in from is directly related to the commercial production efforts in in  fixed costs related to the production facility were charged to cost of goods sold  and in were charged to research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in compared to  in and  in spending in is still below spending levels 
selling  general and administrative costs increased slightly in  only  as compared to in both the years and  the company has made a concerted effort to perform market research studies to demonstrate consumer preference for its orasolv technology 
in  it also initiated direct marketing efforts 
comparing to  expenses increased primarily due to increased bonus payouts to management and increased marketing efforts for orasolv 
net other income was  in compared to  in and  in interest income is the main component of net other income and is dependent upon the cash position of the company and the decreases represent the reduced cash position 
in addition  the figures include  for a state sales and use tax refund for previously purchased fixed assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations to date primarily through private and public sales of its equity securities and revenues from manufacturing agreements 
through december   cima has received net offering proceeds from such private and public sales of  in addition  the company has had net sales of approximately  and has received  for product development fees and license revenues 
among other things  these funds were used to purchase approximately  of capital equipment  including approximately  in the last two quarters of in connection with completing the company s eden prairie manufacturing facility 
in july  the company completed an initial public offering of shares of its common stock  realizing net proceeds of approximately  and in may the company completed another public offering of shares of its common stock  realizing net proceeds of approximately  the funds raised in cima s initial public offering have been used to build out the manufacturing facility  purchase and validate the appropriate production equipment  complete the research and development facilities  and purchase the necessary equipment for that facility 
in  cima successfully completed an fda establishment inspection  a minnesota state inspection  and has been granted a drug enforcement agency license 
the company has used the funds raised in its may public offering primarily to prepare for commercial production in its manufacturing facility  which began in the first quarter of  and to fund research and development for the application of the orasolv registered trademark technology and other new technologies to pharmaceutical products 
the balance of such funds have been used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the company s long term capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the status of the company s collaborative arrangements  the progress of the company s research and development programs  receipt of revenues from the collaborative agreements  sales of the company s products  and the need to expand production capacity 
cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash were approximately  at december  the company believes that its currently available funds  together with any license fees  product development fees  and sales revenue anticipated to be received in the future  may not meet its needs through it is anticipated that in the first half of  the company will need to raise additional funds 
the company is considering numerous types of financing 
these include public or private financings  including equity financing which may be dilutive to shareholders  debt financing with a potential partner that may include product development projects and or establishing a line of credit with a financial institution 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional funds if its capital resources are exhausted  or that funds will be available on terms attractive to the company 
the company has not generated taxable income through december at december   the net operating losses available to offset taxable income were approximately  because the company has experienced ownership changes  pursuant to internal revenue code regulations  future utilization of the operating loss carry forwards will be limited in any one fiscal year 
the carryforwards expire beginning in as a result of the annual limitations  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce potential federal income tax liabilities
