item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following information is provided to facilitate increased understanding of the  and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of the partnership included in the index to financial statements on page f of this report 
material period to period variances in the consolidated statements of income are discussed under results of operations 
the financial condition and liquidity section analyzes cash flows and financial position 
discussion included in other matters addresses key trends  future plans and contingencies 
throughout these discussions  management addresses items that are reasonably likely to materially affect future liquidity or earnings 
through its ownership of the products olp and the crude oil olp  the partnership operates in two industry segments refined products and lpgs transportation  and crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing 
the partnership s reportable segments offer different products and services and are managed separately because each requires different business strategies 
the products olp segment is involved in the transportation  storage and terminaling of petroleum products and the fractionation of ngls 
revenues are derived from the transportation of refined products and lpgs  the storage and short haul shuttle transportation of lpgs at the mont belvieu  texas  complex  sale of product inventory and other ancillary services 
labor and electric power costs comprise the two largest operating expense items of the products olp 
operations are somewhat seasonal with higher revenues generally realized during the first and fourth quarters of each year 
refined products volumes are generally higher during the second and third quarters because of greater demand for gasolines during the spring and summer driving seasons 
lpgs volumes are generally higher from november through march due to higher demand in the northeast for propane  a major fuel for residential heating 
the crude oil olp segment is involved in the transportation and marketing of crude oil and ngls 
revenues are earned from the gathering  storage  transportation and marketing of crude oil  ngls and lube oils principally in oklahoma and texas 
operations of this segment are included from november   upon the acquisition from duke energy 
results of operations summarized below is financial data by business segment in thousands years ended december  operating revenues refined products and lpgs transportation    crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing  total operating revenues    operating income refined products and lpgs transportation    crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing  total operating income    income before extraordinary item refined products and lpgs transportation    crude oil and ngls transportation and marketing  total income before extraordinary item    for the year ended december   the partnership reported a net loss of million 
the net loss included an extraordinary loss for early extinguishment of debt of million  net of million allocated to minority interest 
excluding the extraordinary loss  net income for the year would have been million  compared with net income of million for the million decrease in income before loss on debt extinguishment resulted primarily from a million decrease in operating income  partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense  net of capitalized interest 
net income for the year ended december  increased to million  compared with net income of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income resulted from a million increase in operating revenues and a million decrease in interest expense  net of capitalized interest 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in costs and expenses  and a million decrease in other income net 
see discussion below of factors affecting net income for the comparative periods by business segment 
refined products and lpgs transportation segment volume and average tariff information for  and is presented below percentage increase years ended december  decrease in thousands  except tariff information volumes delivered refined products    lpgs    mont belvieu operations    total    average tariff per barrel refined products lpgs mont belvieu operations average system tariff per barrel compared to operating revenues for the year ended decreased to million from million for the year ended this million decrease resulted from an million decrease in lpgs transportation revenues  a million decrease in other operating revenues and a million decrease in revenues generated from mont belvieu operations  partially offset by a million increase in refined products transportation revenues 
refined products transportation revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  as a result of the increase in volumes delivered and a increase in the refined products average tariff per barrel 
the increase in volumes delivered in was attributable to i favorable midwest price differentials for motor fuel  distillate  jet fuel and natural gasoline  and ii the full period impact of capacity expansions of the mainline system between el dorado  arkansas  and seymour  indiana  the ark la tex system between shreveport  louisiana  and el dorado  and the connection to the colonial pipeline at beaumont  texas 
the increase in the refined products average tariff per barrel reflects new tariff structures for volumes transported on the expanded portion of the ark la tex system and barrels originating from the pipeline connection with colonial s pipeline 
lpgs transportation revenues decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  due to a decrease in volumes delivered  partially offset by a increase in the lpgs average tariff per barrel 
propane revenues decreased million  or  from the prior year primarily due to decreased propane deliveries in the midwest and northeast market areas attributable to warmer winter and spring weather during and unfavorable differentials versus competing canadian product 
butane revenues decreased million  or  from the prior year due primarily to unfavorable blending economics in the midwest and termination of a throughput agreement during the second quarter of decreased petrochemical demand along the upper texas gulf coast resulted in a decrease in short haul propane deliveries 
the increase in the lpgs average tariff per barrel resulted from an increase in of the ratio of long haul to short haul propane deliveries 
revenues generated from mont belvieu operations decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  primarily due to lower storage revenue  lower product receipt charges and decreased propane dehydration fees 
additionally  mont belvieu shuttle deliveries decreased during the year ended  compared with the prior year  due to lower petrochemical and refinery demand for lpgs along the upper texas gulf coast 
the decrease in the mont belvieu shuttle deliveries was largely offset by a increase in the average tariff per barrel attributable to a lower percentage in of contract deliveries  which generally carry lower tariffs 
other operating revenues decreased million during the year ended december   compared with  primarily due to decreased product inventory volumes sold  unfavorable product location exchange differentials incurred to position system inventory  lower amounts of butane received in the midwest for summer storage and decreased terminaling revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by million of operating revenues from the fractionator facilities acquired on march  costs and expenses increased million during the year ended december   compared with the prior year  due to a million increase in operating  general and administrative expenses and a million increase in depreciation and amortization charges  partially offset by a million decrease in operating fuel and power expense and a million decrease in taxes other than income 
the increase in operating  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to million of expense to write down the book value of product inventory to market value  credits of million recorded during for insurance recovery of past litigation costs related to the seymour terminal  a million increase in expenses related to year activities  million of expense related to the fractionator facilities acquired on march   and increased product measurement losses 
these increases in operating  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by expenses recorded for environmental remediation at the partnership s seymour  indiana  terminal in the third quarter of  and lower supplies and services related to pipeline operations and maintenance 
depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of amortization of the value assigned to the fractionation agreement beginning on march   and capital additions placed in service 
operating fuel and power expense decreased from the prior year due primarily to increased mainline pumping efficiencies  lower long haul lpgs volumes and lower summer peak power rates in arkansas 
interest expense decreased million during the year ended december   compared with  as a result of the repayment on january  of the remaining million principal balance of the first mortgage notes  partially offset by interest expense on the million principal amount of the senior notes issued on january   and interest expense on the million term loan used to finance the purchase of the fractionation assets on march  the weighted average interest rate of the million principal amount of the first mortgage notes was  compared with the weighted average interest rate of the million principal amount of the senior notes of 
the interest rate on the million term loan is 
interest capitalized decreased million from the prior year as a result of lower construction balances related to capital projects 
other income net increased during the year ended december   compared with the prior year  as a result of a million gain on the sale of non carrier assets in june and a million loss on the sale of non carrier assets in august these factors were partially offset by lower interest income earned on cash investments in compared to operating revenues for the year ended increased to million from million for the year ended this million increase resulted from a million increase in refined products transportation revenues and a million increase in revenues generated from mont belvieu operations  partially offset by a million decrease in lpgs transportation revenues and a million decrease in other operating revenues 
refined products transportation revenues increased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  as a result of the increase in volumes delivered and a increase in the refined products average tariff per barrel 
the increase in volumes delivered in was attributable to the capacity expansion of the mainline system between el dorado  arkansas  and seymour  indiana  which was completed during the first quarter of  capacity expansion of the ark la tex system between shreveport  louisiana  and el dorado  which was placed in service on march   and the connection to the colonial pipeline  which was placed in service on may  also  jet fuel deliveries increased to million barrels due to a full year of deliveries to the united states air force base near little rock  arkansas  which was completed in june  as well as higher demand from commercial airlines in the midwest 
distillate and natural gasoline deliveries increased during as a result of higher demand in the midwest market area 
mtbe deliveries at the marine terminal near beaumont  texas increased in as a result of higher production along the upper texas gulf coast 
the increase in the refined products average tariff per barrel in was primarily attributable to new tariff structures for volumes transported on the ark la tex system and volumes originating from the colonial pipeline connection 
lpgs transportation revenues decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  due to a decrease in the lpgs average tariff per barrel  partially offset by a increase in volumes delivered 
long haul propane deliveries were lower than in the prior year because of warmer winter weather in the northeast during the first and fourth quarters of these decreases were partially offset by stronger demand for butane as a refinery feedstock due to the resumption during the second quarter of of operations at a northeast refinery that was shut down during early increased petrochemical demand along the upper texas gulf coast resulted in a increase in short haul propane deliveries 
the decrease in the lpgs average tariff per barrel resulted from an increase in of the ratio of short haul to long haul propane deliveries 
revenues generated from mont belvieu operations increased million for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  due primarily to higher terminaling fees on butane received into the system  increased propane dehydration fees and higher petrochemical demand for lpgs along the upper texas gulf coast 
the decrease in the mont belvieu operations average tariff per barrel was due to a higher percentage in of contract deliveries  which generally carry lower tariffs 
other operating revenues decreased million during the year ended december   compared with  as a result of lower volumes of product sold in  lower propane imports at the partnership s marine terminal at providence  rhode island  reduced refined products storage volumes and write downs of product inventory values as a result of higher volumes of product blends in these decreases were partially offset by increased terminaling revenues 
costs and expenses increased million during the year ended december   compared with the prior year  due to a million through put related increase in operating fuel and power expense  a million increase in taxes other than income taxes  and a million increase in depreciation and amortization charges  partially offset by a million decrease in operating  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in taxes other than income taxes  was due primarily to higher property tax assessments in and increased sales taxes in the decrease in operating  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to credits of million recorded during for insurance reimbursement of past litigation costs related to the seymour terminal  decreased outside service costs for system maintenance and lower product measurement losses in the decrease in operating  general and administrative expenses was partially offset by increased labor and benefits expense and rental expense of the colonial capacity lease 
interest expense decreased million during the year ended december   compared with  due to the million principal payment on the first mortgage notes in march interest capitalized increased million over the prior year as a result of higher construction balances related to capital projects  which commenced during  and were completed during other income net decreased during the year ended december   compared with the prior year  due primarily to lower interest income earned on cash balances as a result of lower cash balances during  and a million loss recorded on the sale of the partnership s arkansas city  arkansas  terminal

other matters regulatory and environmental the operations of the partnership are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment 
although the partnership believes the operations of the pipeline system are in material compliance with applicable environmental regulations  risks of significant costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline operations  and there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from the operations of the pipeline system  could result in substantial costs and liabilities to the partnership 
the partnership does not anticipate that changes in environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial position  operations or cash flows in the near term 
the partnership and the indiana department of environmental management idem have entered into an agreed order that will ultimately result in a remediation program for any on site and off site groundwater contamination attributable to the partnership s operations at the seymour  indiana  terminal 
a feasibility study  which includes the partnership s proposed remediation program  has been approved by idem 
idem will issue a record of decision formally approving the remediation program 
after the record of decision has been issued  the partnership will enter into an agreed order for the continued operation and maintenance of the program 
the partnership estimates that the costs of the remediation program being proposed by the partnership for the seymour terminal will not exceed the amount accrued therefore approximately million at december  
in the opinion of the company  the completion of the remediation program being proposed by the partnership  if such program is approved by idem  will not have a material adverse impact on the partnership s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
year issues in  the company initiated a program to prepare the partnership s process controls and business computer systems for the year issue 
process controls are the automated equipment including hardware and software systems which run operational activities 
business computer systems are the computer hardware and software used by the partnership 
the partnership is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  test  remediate or replace all non compliant computerized systems and applications 
the company continues to evaluate appropriate courses of corrective action  including replacement of certain systems whose associated costs would be recorded as assets and amortized 
the partnership incurred approximately million of expense during and related to the year issue 
the company estimates the remaining amounts required to address the year issue will be approximately million 
a portion of such costs would have been incurred as part of normal system and application upgrades 
in certain cases  the timing of expenditures has been accelerated due to the year issue 
although the company believes this estimate to be reasonable  due to the complexities of the year issue  there can be no assurance that the actual costs to address the year issue will not be significantly greater 
the partnership has adopted a three phase year program consisting of phase i preliminary assessment  phase ii detailed assessment and remediation planning  and phase iii remediation activities and testing 
the products olp has completed phase i  phase ii is nearing completion  and phase iii is ongoing 
the crude oil olp is nearing completion of phase i 
remediation activities and testing for systems deemed most critical are scheduled to be completed by mid  with testing of all process controls and business computer systems completed during the third quarter of with respect to its third party relationships  the partnership has contacted its suppliers and service providers to assess their state of year readiness 
information continues to be updated regularly  thus the partnership anticipates receiving additional information in the near future that will assist in determining the extent to which the partnership may be vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their year issues 
however  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies  on which the partnership s systems rely  will be timely converted  or converted in a manner that is compatible with the partnership s systems  or that any such failures by other companies would not have a material adverse effect on the partnership 
despite the partnership s efforts to address and remediate its year issue  there can be no assurance that all process controls and business computer systems will continue without interruption through january  and beyond 
the complexity of identifying and testing all embedded microprocessors that are installed in hardware throughout the pipeline system used for process or flow control  transportation  security  communication and other systems may result in unforeseen operational failures 
although the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be estimated  failures that result in substantial disruptions of business activities could have a material adverse effect on the partnership 
in order to mitigate potential disruptions  the partnership will complete contingency plans for its critical systems  processes and external relationships by mid fourth quarter of other during june  the partnership filed rate increases on selective refined products tariffs and lpgs tariffs  averaging 
these rate increases became effective july  without suspension or refund obligation 
on july   general rate decreases of for both refined products tariffs and lpgs tariffs became effective 
the rate decreases were calculated pursuant to the index methodology promulgated by the ferc 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no
