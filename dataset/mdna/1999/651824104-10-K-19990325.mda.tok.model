this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and associated notes 
this discussion includes the impact of the acquisition of mikroprecision instruments  inc mpi for all periods and environmental optical sensors  inc eosi for  which were accounted for using the purchase method  as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements on page of this form k 
results of operations financial analysis the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percent of the company s net sales and as period to period percent increases or decreases period to period percent of net sales increase decrease net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense income from operations interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income net sales for  and  the company s net sales totaled million  million and million  respectively

net sales for increased million compared with  with increases of million in domestic markets partially offset by a million decrease in international markets 
domestic sales totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  sales increased million compared with this growth was principally attributable to sales increases of million and million to the fiber optic communications and research markets  respectively  partially offset by sales declines in the semiconductor and computer peripherals markets of million and million  respectively 
the domestic semiconductor and page computer peripherals markets were negatively impacted by the economic situation in asia and overcapacity throughout much of  which resulted in lower demand for capital equipment the company supplies to these markets 
domestic sales in increased million versus the growth is primarily attributable to a million increase in sales to the semiconductor equipment  fiber optic communications and computer peripherals markets  sales growth totaling million to research customers and increases in sales to other general metrology customers 
international sales totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
sales in decreased million versus sales to european markets  reflecting the company s efforts to expand commercial market penetration  grew million  or  over  with france  germany  the netherlands  the united kingdom and switzerland accounting for most of the increase 
negative foreign exchange rate effects on european sales totaled million 
sales to asian markets declined million  or  with hong kong  korea  taiwan and the asean countries accounting for most of the decrease and sales into japan increasing million 
sales into canada and latin america grew million  or  over canada and latin america sales were also negatively impacted by a foreign exchange rate effect  which totaled million 
for  international sales decreased million versus primarily due to the effect of the stronger us dollar  which negatively impacted the translation of european sales by million when compared with  and continued softness throughout most of the year in european research markets  particularly france and germany 
excluding the negative foreign exchange rate effects  european sales were approximately flat in as compared with pacific rim sales declined million in versus results in this region were mixed with sales to the hong kong and taiwan markets growing million while sales to japan and the asean countries declined million 
the order rate was essentially flat year over year as strong growth in the fiber optic communications market segment was offset by declines in the company s other segments 
management expects improvements in sales in particularly in the united states and europe as the company continues to leverage its expertise in the design  manufacture and marketing of high precision components  instruments and integrated systems to the fiber optic communications  semiconductor equipment  computer peripherals and scientific research markets 
however  the continued strength of the us dollar against european currencies and the economic uncertainty in asia may offset in part the anticipated sales growth in those markets 
overall  management anticipates that net sales in will increase over  however  such growth is dependent on many factors and cannot be assured 
operating income total cost of sales and operating expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
gross margin was  and for  and  respectively 
the company s gross margin was essentially flat in versus the decrease in gross margin in from was attributable primarily to the higher growth rates in sales to oem customers in the company s target markets  which generally have lower margins  but also lower sales and marketing expenses 
management anticipates that  despite the expectation that sales to oem customers in the company s target markets will comprise an increasing proportion of the company s net sales  the company s overall gross margin will increase slightly in as a result of increased sales volume and continued manufacturing productivity improvements company wide 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing  and of net sales in the respective years 
sg a decreased in versus by million primarily due to decreased costs for incentive compensation programs  lower advertising expenses  reduced sales and marketing expenses in europe that resulted from changes made in to the european sales organization and favorable exchange rate effect in europe of million 
the million decrease in sg a in compared with resulted primarily from favorable exchange rate effects in europe  decreases in advertising and other controllable expenses  delayed personnel replacement and the favorable effect on sales and marketing page expenses from the mix shift toward oem customers 
excluding the million benefit of exchange rates  real sg a expenses increased million or less than compared with management anticipates that sg a expenses in total will increase in but will decline as a percent of sales as a result of increased sales volume 
research and development r d expenses totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
r d expenses represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the increases in r d expenses in compared with and in compared with  were attributable primarily to increased personnel costs related to the development of a number of new products and product enhancements including extending the range of the company s automated packaging and test equipment product lines for the fiber optic communications market  improvements to the laserweld packaging workstation  development of laser diode burn in and characterization systems and new products and software for the company s instruments and systems segment 
management is committed to continued product development and intends to maintain r d expenditures at a level between and of net sales for the development of new products and product improvements 
the company is dependent to a significant extent upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce innovative new products that gain market acceptance 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in selecting  developing or manufacturing new products  or in enhancing its existing products so as to achieve such market acceptance 
operating income totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
operating income represented  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
management anticipates that operating income will improve in  both in total and as a percentage of net sales  primarily as a result of anticipated net sales growth exceeding expense growth 
interest expense interest expense totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
although a majority of the company s debt is at fixed interest rates  the company anticipates interest expense for will decrease slightly from because its long term debt base will be reduced in each of the second and fourth quarters when principal payments of million are due 
other income expense  net interest and dividend income totaled million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
exchange losses were million and million in and  respectively  versus exchange gains of less than million in the company recorded investment gains totaling million in as well as other expense of million 
minimal investment gains were recorded in there were no investment gains recorded in taxes based on income the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for compared with was primarily the result of improved profitability at the company s european operations resulting in the increased utilization of foreign tax loss carryforwards 
management anticipates that the company s effective tax rate in will remain at approximately the same level as the effective tax rate in as a result of an expected continuation of benefits from the utilization of foreign tax loss carryforwards 
employment worldwide employment of the company totaled  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in employment at december   was a result of the acquisition of eosi and the expansion of the company s research and development efforts 
sales per employee approximated   and  during  and  respectively 
page stockholders equity stockholders equity increased from million per diluted share as of december   to million per diluted share as of december  and to million per diluted share as of december  the increases in and were attributable to the respective year earnings and issuance of stock under stock option and purchase plans  offset in part by dividend payments  unrealized translation losses and repurchase of stock under the company s share repurchase program 
the company paid dividends totaling million during each of the years  and  respectively 
this represents cents per share for each year 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily attributable to the company s operating income plus non cash items  principally depreciation and amortization  offset in part by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
customer receivables increased in  while sales grew by 
inventories increased in over levels in part because of production planning associated with the company s goal of maintaining competitive manufacturing lead times 
the company believes that it must maintain certain levels of inventory in order to ensure that the lead times to its customers remain competitive  however high levels of inventory increases the risk that the company will have to write down inventory in the future due to obsolescence if the company does not correctly anticipate market demand for certain of its products 
accounts payable increased in compared with as a result of higher inventory levels offset in part by lower operating expenses 
net cash used in investing activities of million was attributable principally to the company s purchases of property  plant and equipment million and acquisition costs associated with the purchase of eosi million  partially offset by the net proceeds on the sale of an equity investment and other property million 
the company s expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment aggregated million and million for and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities of million was attributable principally to the repurchase of stock under the company s share repurchase program and by a decrease in long term borrowings  partially offset by the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option and purchase plans 
in february  newport s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares under the company s share repurchase program which commenced in april this brings the total number of shares authorized for repurchase to  the company repurchased  and  of such shares in and  respectively 
at december   the company had in place a million unsecured line of credit expiring december  with interest at prime  or libor plus and an unused line fee of basis points to support its worldwide operations 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit with million available after considering outstanding letters of credit 
the company believes its current working capital position together with estimated cash flows from operations and its existing credit availability are adequate to fund operations in the ordinary course of business  anticipated capital expenditures  debt payment requirements  and continuation of its share repurchase program over at least the next year and for the foreseeable future 
however  this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks see additional factors that may affect operating results  below  and there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional funding in the future 
although the company has no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies  the company continues to evaluate acquisitions of products  technologies or companies that complement the company s business and may make such acquisitions in the future  and there can be no assurance that the company will not need to obtain additional sources of capital to finance any such acquisitions 
page impact of year certain business operations software programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those software programs are time sensitive and recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including but not limited to  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company initiated a review of its business operations software requirements in early as part of the normal course of upgrading its systems to support current and anticipated growth 
among the criteria for acquiring new or upgraded software was that it be year compliant 
in the company acquired new operating software that is year compliant 
testing and implementation occurred throughout with final conversion at year end 
cost of acquiring the upgraded computer hardware and software was approximately million and has been capitalized 
newport sells certain products that include various software applications 
the company has determined that  since january   its product software has been year compliant 
the company has also requested assurance from its goods and services providers that they are  or have programs in place to be  year compliant 
the company established an information technology steering committee  which reports directly to the president and chief executive officer 
the committee members include executive management and employees with expertise from various disciplines including  but not limited to  information technology  engineering  finance  customer service  communications  facilities  procurement and human resources 
the committee is responsible for addressing year issues associated with the company s business application systems including  but not limited to  the company s customer service  operations and financial systems and end user applications  embedded systems  including equipment that operates such items as the company s telecommunications and facilities  software applications embedded in certain of the company s products  vendor and supplier relationships  and contingency planning 
while the company anticipates no major interruption of its business activities  that will be dependent in part  upon the ability of third parties to be year compliant 
the company s most likely potential risk is the inability of some customers to order and or pay on a timely basis and or the inability of some suppliers to receive orders and or deliver on a timely basis 
although the company has implemented the actions described above to address third party issues  it has no direct ability to influence the compliance actions by such parties 
accordingly  while the company believes its actions in this regard should reduce year risks  it is unable to eliminate them or to estimate the ultimate effect year risks may have 
while the company currently believes that neither the software developed by it as part of its products nor the software licensed by it for its internal use will be materially affected by year problems  there can be no assurance that the company s product software  its internal computer systems and networks or those of its key vendors  developers  distributors and customers will not be affected by such year issues  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
european economic and monetary union emu new european currency on january   member countries of the european economic and monetary union established fixed conversion rates between their existing national currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro trades on currency exchanges and  during a three year dual currency transition period  either the euro or the national currencies may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and the national currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
the company s operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion have established plans to address the systems and business issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among page others  the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transactions  and the competitive impact of cross border price transparency  which may make it more difficult for businesses to charge different prices for the same products on a country by country basis  particularly once the euro currency is issued in while  the company anticipates that the euro conversion will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance that the company s key vendors  customers and distributors will not be affected by such euro currency issues  which could have an adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
further  there can be no assurance that the currency market volatility will not increase  which could have an adverse effect on the company s euro exposures 
adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting comprehensive income sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components  however  the adoption of this statement had no impact on the company s net income or stockholders equity 
sfas no 
requires unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments  which prior to adoption were reported separately in shareholders equity  to be included in other comprehensive income 
prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the requirements of sfas no 
adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
while adoption of sfas no 
results in more reported segments see note than previously reported  it does not have an impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
pending adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes new standards for recording derivatives in interim and annual financial reports requiring that all derivative instruments be recorded as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and therefore the company will adopt the new requirements effective with the filing of its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  management does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
additional factors that may affect future operating results the company s future operating results  and stock price  may be affected by a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ from those stated herein 
these factors include the following rapid technological change  new product development the computer peripherals  semiconductor equipment and fiber optic communications equipment markets  as well as the other markets for the company s products  are characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements 
demand for certain of the company s products is dependent upon the market acceptance of the products manufactured by the company s customers  and there can be no assurance that such market acceptance will be achieved 
the page company is also dependent to a significant extent upon its ability to enhance its existing products  to predict the needs of its customers and to develop and introduce innovative new products on a timely basis that gain market acceptance 
failure to develop  or introduce on a timely basis  new products or product enhancements that meet its customers needs and achieve market acceptance could materially adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although the company maintains an active development program to improve its product offerings  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing its existing products on a timely or cost effective basis 
risks of doing business in international markets in  and  international revenues  which include export sales  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s net sales 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of the company s net sales for the foreseeable future 
as a result of conducting business internationally  the company is subject to various risks  which include a greater difficulty of administering its business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements such as export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer accounts receivable cycles  currency fluctuations  export control restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  political and economic instability and general trade restrictions 
in addition  due to various factors  including the difficulty of assessing the various political and economic factors that may affect the strength of foreign economies  it is often difficult to project demand for the company s products in foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of the company s international sales and operations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could affect the sales price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets  the us dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies as well as local costs and expenses of the company s foreign operations 
the company uses forward exchange contracts  and other risk management techniques  to hedge its exposure to currency fluctuations relating to its intercompany transactions  however  its international subsidiaries remain exposed to the economic risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not adversely impact the company s operations in the future or require the company to modify its current business practices 
dependence on research budgets of customers a substantial amount of the company s net sales has historically been derived from sales of its products to academic and governmental research institutions in the united states and various foreign countries  and the company anticipates that sales to such institutions will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net sales for the foreseeable future 
as such  the company s future performance is directly dependent in part upon the capital expenditure budgets of its research institution customers and the continued demand of such customers for the company s products 
many domestic and foreign research institutions  including certain of the company s customers  have experienced constraints on their capital expenditure budgets due to factors such as reduced governmental funding of research activities and reduced defense spending 
the company s operating results may in the future be subject to period to period fluctuations as a consequence of such funding constraints  and there can be no assurance that such constraints will not continue over time  or that they will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
page competition intense competition exists among manufacturers of precise motion  measurement and automation products  and the company believes that competition from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future 
the company competes principally in several specialized market segments against a limited number of companies  some of which are more established  enjoy higher name recognition and possess far greater financial  technological and marketing resources than the company  while others are relatively small and highly specialized firms 
the company currently competes principally on the basis of the performance and quality of its products  including reliability  as well as on price and timely manufacture and delivery 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors  or that new competitors  some of which may have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company  will not seek to enter the markets served by the company s products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that competitive pressures will not cause the company to reduce prices  which would negatively affect its gross margins 
dependence on component availability and key suppliers the company s ability to meet customer demand depends in part upon its ability to obtain adequate supplies of components from its vendors on a timely basis 
the company currently procures various components from single sources due to unique component designs as well as certain quality and performance requirements 
if such single sourced components were to become unavailable or were to become unavailable on terms satisfactory to the company  the company would be required to purchase comparable components from other sources 
if for any reason the company could not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  the company s business  results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  certain of the company s suppliers require long lead times to deliver requested quantities of components 
if the company were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components used in the manufacture of its products  resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could occur and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
fluctuations in operating results the company s past operating results have been  and its future operating results will be  subject to fluctuations resulting from a number of factors  including the availability of government research funding  the demand for the products sold by the company s customers  the timing of new product introductions by the company or its competitors  variations in the mix of products sold by the company  changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or suppliers  including possible decreases in average selling prices of the company s products in response to competitive pressures  market acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of the company s products  the availability and cost of key components  the availability of manufacturing capacity  and fluctuations in general economic conditions 
the company s overall gross margins may vary significantly on a period to period basis due to a number of factors including variations in product mix 
in addition  competitive pressures may adversely affect gross margins 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain satisfactory gross margins 
the company also may choose to reduce prices or to increase spending in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities  all of which may adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indications of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in some future quarters  which would likely result in a decline in the trading price of the common stock 
page integration of acquisitions the company s recent growth has been partly the result of strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
accordingly  the company s future operating results will be dependent on its ability to integrate various business operations in an effective manner 
the company intends to further broaden its product offering by designing and marketing complete systems comprised of components manufactured within its various operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in managing and integrating such business operations 
in addition  the company s acquisition related growth will continue to place additional demands on the company s management and resources 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risk ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed is foreign exchange rates which may generate translation and transaction gains and losses 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  may cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
international operations constituted less than of the company s consolidated operating profit 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of international operations into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
the company does not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
the company does not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because it does not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating future international operating profit include the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and swiss franc 
the company estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on reported operating profit 
the company believes that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a subsidiary s functional currency 
net foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the company s earnings for the last three years 
the impact of unrealized foreign exchange translation gains and losses is disclosed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page interest rate risk the company has no significant exposure to interest rate risk as its primary debt instruments carry fixed interest rates 
the sensitivity analyses presented in the interest rate and foreign exchange discussions above disregard the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category and vice versa
