evidence of this competitive and difficult business environment includes the following trends reduction in direct vendor relationships as the number of distributors is reduced  difficulties in receiving vendor incentive support as a result of vendor profitability problems and difficulties in pricing channels as the remaining distributors reduce prices in order to retain market share

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise primarily from the funding of working capital needs  including inventories and trade accounts receivable 
historically  the company has financed its liquidity needs largely through internally generated funds  borrowings under its credit agreement and vendor lines of credit 
the company derives all of its operating income and cash flow from its subsidiaries and relies on payments from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its obligations 
as the company pursues its growth strategy and acquisition opportunities both in the united states and in latin america  management believes that exchange controls in certain countries may limit the ability of the company s present and future subsidiaries in those countries to make payments to the company

at june   the company had borrowings of million under this facility 
maximum borrowings under the credit agreement are generally based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory as defined in the credit agreement less a million reserve 
the million reserve can be drawn upon  if necessary  to finance obligations to finova capital corporation  which finances the company s purchases from certain vendors 
if this amended agreement had been in place at june   available borrowings under this agreement  based on collateral limitations  would have been million at that date million of which would only have been available to finance obligations due to finova  if necessary

management believes that the credit agreement together with vendor lines of credit and internally generated funds  will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs during fiscal inflation and price levels inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s business because of the typically decreasing costs of products sold by the company 
the company also receives vendor price protection for a significant portion of its inventory 
in the event a vendor reduces its prices for goods purchased by the company prior to the company s sale of such goods  the company generally has been able either to receive a credit from the vendor for the price differential or to return the goods to the vendor for a credit against the purchase price 
as the company pursues its growth strategy to acquire businesses and assets in foreign countries  the company may operate in certain countries that have experienced high rates of inflation and hyperinflation 
at this time  management does not expect that inflation will have a material impact on the company s business in the immediate future 
year the company has evaluated its major computer software and operating systems to determine their respective date sensitivity in light of the possible inability of certain computer programs to handle dates beyond the year the year issue 
the company s plans for dealing with the year issue have included the following phases inventorying affected technology and assessing potential impact of the year issue  determining the need for software and operating system upgrades and replacements  implementing and testing newly installed software and operating systems  and developing contingency plans 
many of the company s hardware  software and operating systems have already been updated to the latest versions available 
the company relies on third party suppliers for many systems  products and services including telecommunications and data center support 
the company may be adversely impacted if these suppliers have not made the necessary changes to their own systems and products in a timely manner 
the cost to the company of software and hardware remediation was approximately  during fiscal and is estimated to be  during fiscal the total cost of updating the company s software and operating systems is currently estimated at approximately potential risk factors for the company relating to the year issue may include loss of order processing and order shipment capabilities  the potential inability to effectively manage distribution center inventory  and potential complications with telephone or email communications 
the company currently believes that the majority of its mission critical systems pose a low risk to the company s overall operational abilities  due to the fact that the company has updated most of its software and operating systems to recent versions 
furthermore  the company has taken measures to ensure that its systems that pose a potentially higher risk to the company s overall operational abilities have been updated 
the company believes that it is taking the appropriate measures to develop contingency plans that address the likely worst case scenarios relating to the year issue 
although the company believes that the measures it is currently undertaking and intends to undertake will adequately address the year issue  it has developed alternative plans should potential complications arise 
though essential to the operation of the company s business  the software and operating systems that the company currently utilizes may be supplemented by manual processing and shipment of orders
