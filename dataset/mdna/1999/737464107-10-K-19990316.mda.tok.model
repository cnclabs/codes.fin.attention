a community is generally considered by the company to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of i attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or ii one year after completion of construction 
at december   the company s portfolio of apartment communities consisted of the following i communities that were completed and stabilized for all of the current and prior year  ii seven communities that achieved full stabilization during the prior year  iii communities which reached stabilization during  and iv communities currently in the development or lease up stage  including additions to five existing communities 
for communities with respect to which construction is completed and the community has become fully operational  all property operating and maintenance expenses are expensed as incurred and those recurring and non recurring expenditures relating to acquiring new assets  materially enhancing the value of an existing asset  or substantially extending the useful life of an existing asset are capitalized

during the lease up phase  the sum of interest expense on completed units and other operating expenses including pre opening marketing expenses will initially exceed rental revenues  resulting in a lease up deficit  which continues until such time as rental revenues exceed such expenses

all expenditures necessary to maintain a community in ordinary operating condition are expensed as incurred 
during the first five years of a community which corresponds to the estimated depreciable life  carpet replacements are expensed as incurred 
thereafter  carpet replacements are capitalized 
acquisition of assets and community improvement expenditures for the years ended december  and are summarized as follows year ended december  new community development and acquisition activity   revenue generating additions and improvements property renovations   submetering of water service  nonrecurring capital expenditures vehicle access control gates other community additions and improvements  corporate additions and improvements  recurring capital expenditures carpet replacements   other community additions and improvements   corporate additions and improvements   inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities allow  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder  and thus may enable the company to seek increases in rents 
the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less and the remaining leases are for up to two years 
at the expiration of a lease term  the company s lease agreements provide that the term will be extended unless either the company or the lessee gives at least sixty days written notice of termination  in addition  the company s policy permits the earlier termination of a lease by a lessee upon thirty days written notice to the company and the payment of one month s additional rent as compensation for early termination 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation 
year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
the company s computer equipment and software and devices with imbedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to engage in normal business activities 
the company has created a specially formed year project team to evaluate and coordinate the company s year initiatives  which are intended to ensure that its computer equipment and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
for this purpose  the term computer equipment and software includes systems that are commonly thought of as it systems  including property management and accounting software  data processing  and telephone pbx systems and other miscellaneous systems  as well as systems that are not commonly thought of as it systems  such as elevators  alarm systems  or other miscellaneous systems 
both it and non it systems may contain embedded technology  which complicates the company s year identification  assessment  remediation  and testing efforts 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company believes that certain of the computer equipment and software it currently uses will require replacement or modification 
in addition  in the ordinary course of replacing computer equipment and software  the company attempts to obtain replacements that are year compliant 
utilizing both internal and external resources to identify and assess needed year remediation  the company currently anticipates that its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts will be completed by june   and that such efforts will be completed prior to any currently anticipated impact on its computer equipment and software 
the company estimates that as of december   it had completed approximately of the initiatives that it believes will be necessary to fully address potential year issues relating to its computer equipment and software 
the projects comprising the remaining of the initiatives are in process and are expected to be completed on or about june  the company has mailed letters to its significant suppliers  contractors and third party service providers to determine the extent to which interfaces with such entities are vulnerable to year issues and whether the products and services purchased from or by such entities are year compliant 
the company is following up on mailings to significant suppliers  contractors and third party service providers that did not initially respond  or whose responses were deemed unsatisfactory by the company 
at this time  the company estimates the aggregate cost of its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts  or costs expected to be incurred by the company with respect to year issues of third parties to be approximately million 
expenditures related to the company s year initiatives will be funded from operating cash flows 
as of december   the company had incurred costs of approximately million related to its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts  all of which relates to analysis  repair or replacement of existing software  upgrades of existing software  or evaluation of information received from significant suppliers  contractors and other third party service providers 
other non year it efforts have not been materially delayed or impacted by year initiatives 
the company presently believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not effected timely with respect to year problems that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not materially adversely impact the company s results of operations or adversely affect the company s relationships with suppliers  contractors or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse impact on the company s business or results of operations 
the company has begun  but not yet completed  a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenues that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure by the company and certain third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
the company currently plans to complete such analysis and contingency planning by august  risks involved with not solving the year issue include  but are not limited to  the following loss of local or regional electric power  loss of telecommunications services  delays or cancellations of shipping or transportation to major building suppliers  general deterioration of economic conditions resulting from year issues  and inability of banks  vendors and other third parties with whom the company does business to resolve year problems 
the company has engaged an independent expert to provide an ongoing evaluation of its year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
the costs of the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts and the dates on which the company believes it will complete such efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of relevant computer codes and embedded technology  and similar uncertainties 
in addition  variability of definitions of compliance with year and the myriad of different products and services  and combinations thereof  sold by the company may lead to claims whose impact on the company is not currently estimable 
there can be no assurance that the aggregate cost of defending and resolving such claims  if any  will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
although some of the company s agreements with suppliers and contractors contain provisions requiring such parties to indemnify the company under some circumstances  there can be no assurance that such indemnification arrangements will cover all of the company s liabilities and costs related to claims by third parties related to the year issue 
new accounting pronouncements see note to consolidated financial statements of the company 
funds from operations and cash available for distribution historical funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined to mean net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs 
cash available for distribution cad is defined as ffo less capital expenditures funded by operations and loan amortization payments 
the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the company  ffo and cad should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this report

ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
however  the company s ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition 
recurring capital expenditures consisted primarily of   and  of carpet replacement and   and  of other community additions and improvements to existing communities for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since the company does not add back the depreciation of non real estate assets in its calculation of ffo  capital expenditures of   and are excluded from the calculation of cad for the years ended december   and  respectively
