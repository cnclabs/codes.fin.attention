item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a delaware corporation and at december  had five commercial banks as subsidiaries  glacier bank  glacier bank of whitefish  glacier bank of eureka  first security bank of missoula  and valley bank of helena 
the following discussion and analysis includes the effects of the pooling of interests merger with hub financial corporation  and the purchase accounting treatment of the minority shares of valley bank of helena 
prior period information has been restated to include amounts from the hub financial corporation merger 
the company reported earnings of  for the year ended december   or basic earnings per share  and diluted earnings per share  compared to  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december   and  or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  during  the fdic saif fund was recapitalized through one time payments from thrift institutions 
glacier bank s after tax cost of this payment was  or 
basic earnings per share  in addition  after tax expenses related to the merger of first security bank were  or 
basic earnings per share 
operating earnings without the saif and merger expenses were  or basic earnings per share 
this continued improvement in net income can be attributed to an increase in earning assets  management of net interest margin  and strong non interest income 
the following narrative and charts focus on the significant financial changes which have taken place over the past years and include a discussion of the company s financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand  deposit withdrawals  maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses 
this source of funds is generated by deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  sale of loans and securities  short and long term borrowings  and net income 
in addition  all five subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank of seattle 
this membership provides for established lines of credit in the form of advances which serve as a supplemental source of funds for lending and other general business purposes 
during  all five financial institutions maintained liquidity at a level deemed sufficient to meet operating cash needs 
the liquidity was in excess of regulatory requirements 
retention of a portion of glacier bancorp  inc s earnings results in stockholders equity at december  of  or of assets  which compares with  or of assets at december  earnings retention and increases resulting from the exercise of stock options and acquisitions has outpaced the increase in assets of  or  during the stockholder s equity ratio remains well above required regulatory levels  and above the average of the company s peers  providing flexibility in the management of assets 
financial condition for the year ended december   consolidated assets increased  or over the prior year 
the following table summarizes the company s major asset and liability components as a percentage of total assets at december    and major balance sheet components as a percentage of total assets december  assets cash  and cash equivalents  investment securities  fhlb and federal reserve stock real estate loans commercial loans installment and other loans other assets liabilities and stockholder s equity deposit accounts fhlb advances other borrowings and repurchase agreements other liabilities stockholders equity real estate loans continue to be the largest component of the company s assets  although the percentage is decreasing  and commercial loans are increasing as a result of the company s strategy 
deposit accounts  with comparatively short terms to maturity  represent the majority of the liabilities 
effect of inflation and changing prices generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without consideration for change in relative purchasing over time due to inflation 
virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
gap analysis the following table gives a description of our gap position for various time periods 
as of december   we had a positive gap position at six months  and a negative gap position at twelve months 
the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets for six months is a positive which compares to a positive 
at december  and at december  the table also shows the gap earnings sensitivity  and earnings sensitivity ratio  along with a brief description as to how they are calculated 
the traditional one dimensional view of gap is not sufficient to show a bank s ability to withstand interest rate changes 
superior earnings power is also a key factor in reducing exposure to higher interest rates 
for example  our gap earnings sensitivity ratio shows that a change in interest rates would only change income by 
because of our gap position  the table illustrates how a increase in rates would increase the company s income by approximately  using this analysis to join gap information with earnings data  it produces a better picture of our strength and ability to handle interest rate change 
the methodology used to compile this gap information is based on our mix of assets and liabilities and the historical experience accumulated regarding their rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity and gap analysis as of december  projected maturity or repricing more than non rate dollars in thousands months months years years sensitive total assets interest bearing deposits   investment securities      mortgage backed securities      floating rate loans      fixed rate loans      other earning assets    non earning assets   total assets       liabilities and equity deposits      fhlb advances      other purchased funds   other liabilities   equity   total liabilities and equity 
      gap earnings sensitivity 
gap earnings sensitivity ratio gap earnings sensitivity is the estimated effect on income after taxes of  of a increase or decrease in interest rates x  less tax of 
gap earnings sensitivity ratio is gap earnings sensitivity divided by the estimated yearly earnings of  a increase in interest rates has this estimated percentage increase effect on annual income 
this table estimates the repricing maturities of the company s assets and liabilities  based upon the company s assessment of the repricing characteristics of the various instruments 
non contractual deposit liabilities are allocated among the various maturity categories as follows non interest bearing checking and interest bearing checking are included in the more than years category 
regular savings are included in the years category 
money market balances are included in the less than months category 
mortgage backed securities are at the anticipated principal payments based on the weighted average life 
interest rate spread one way to protect against interest rate volatility is to maintain a comfortable interest spread between yields on assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
as shown below the net interest spread decreased in from to  primarily the result of lower rates on interest earning assets 
the net interest margin increased slightly in from to  primarily the result of an increase in interest earning assets 
although the interest spread is down from the increased asset levels  and the increased interest free funding resulted in significantly higher net interest income 
december  
for the year ended combined weighted average yield on loans and investments 
combined weighted average rate paid on savings deposits and borrowings 
net interest spread net interest margin 

weighted averages are computed without the effect of compounding daily interest 

includes dividends received on capital stock of the federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank 

the net interest margin net yield on average interest earning assets is interest income from loans and investments tax free income adjusted for tax effect less interest expense from deposits  fhlb advances  and other borrowings  divided by the total amount of earning assets 
future accounting pronouncements please see the notes to the consolidated financial statement for information on accounting pronouncements 
year issues the century date change for the year is a serious issue that may impact virtually every organization including the company 
many software programs are not able to recognize the year  since most programs and systems were designed to store calendar years in the s by assuming and and storing only the last two digits of the year 
the problem is especially important to financial institutions since many transactions  such as interest accruals and payments  are date sensitive  and because the company and its subsidiary banks interact with numerous customers  vendors and third party service providers who must also address the year issue 
the problem is not limited to computer systems 
year issues will also potentially affect every system that has an embedded microchip  such as automated teller machines  elevators and vaults 
state of readiness the company and its subsidiary banks are committed to addressing these year issues in a prompt and responsible manner  and they have dedicated the resources to do so 
management has completed an assessment of its automated systems and has implemented a program consistent with applicable regulatory guidelines  to complete all steps necessary to resolve identified issues 
the company s compliance program has several phases  including project management  assessment  testing  and remediation and implementation 
project management the company has formed a year compliance committee consisting of senior management and departmental representatives 
the committee has met regularly since october a year compliance plan was developed and regular meetings have been held to discuss the process  assign tasks  determine priorities and monitor progress 
the committee regularly reports to the company s board 
assessment all of the company s and its subsidiary banks computer equipment and mission critical software programs have been identified 
this phase is essentially complete 
primary software vendors were also assessed during this phase  and vendors who provide mission critical software have been contacted 
the year committee is in the process of obtaining written certification from providers of material services that such providers are  or will be  year compliant 
based upon its ongoing assessment of the readiness of its vendors  suppliers and service providers  the committee intends to develop contingency plans addressing the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
the committee will continue to monitor and work with these vendors 
the committee and other bank officers have also identified and began working with  the subsidiary banks significant borrowers and funds providers to assess the extent to which they may be affected by year issues 
testing 
updating and testing of the company s and its subsidiary banks automated systems is currently underway and it is anticipated that all testing will be complete by january  upon completion  the committee will be able to identify any internal computer systems that remain non compliant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change thereby impacting net interest income nii  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  as compared to the board approved policy limit 
estimated rate change nii sensitivity bp bp the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cashflows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
forward looking information the discussion above may include certain forward looking statements concerning the future operations of the company 
the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of as they apply to forward looking statements 
this statement is for the express purpose of availing the company of the protections of such safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements 
management s ability to predict results of the effect of future plans in inherently uncertain  and is subject to factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected
