the company markets its products through its own sales organization and  to a lesser extent  through a network of independent sales representatives 
in addition to the company s headquarters in dallas  texas  the company has sales offices located in or near santa clara  california  boston  massachusetts  phoenix  arizona  minneapolis  minnesota  london  england  and paris  france 
the company s sales personnel market products directly to key customers as well as support the sales representative network 
in addition  the company has entered into distribution agreements with key national and international distribution partners  including anixter  fuji xerox  gates arrow and westcon 
interphase emphasizes its extensive product support  training and field support to its customers 
the company s products are generally sold with a one to three year warranty covering components and labor 
after the expiration of the warranty period  the company generally provides support services for a stated flat fee 
the company and its customers generally enter into written agreements specifying  among other items standard in commercial agreements  product specifications  failure rates  shipping requirements  shipment rescheduling terms  price volume schedules and manufacturer warranties 
substantially all of these agreements do not contain determinable purchase commitments of the customers  providing instead that actual purchase and shipments of products be made by specific purchase order 
accordingly  any shipment rates stated in such contracts are subject to rescheduling and or cancellation  and therefore are not indicative of the future purchase orders to be submitted by such customer 
in addition  the actual terms of the contracts tend to be modified in the ordinary course of business by means of subsequent purchase order terms and by course of dealing 
the company does not believe that the level of backlog of orders is either material or indicative of future results  since its contracts are subject to revision through subsequent purchase orders and since its customers are generally permitted to cancel purchase orders  within certain parameters  prior to shipment without penalty 
the majority of the company s sales are to oems with payment terms typically being net days from date of invoice 
manufacturing and supplies most manufacturing operations are currently conducted at the company s headquarters in dallas  texas

the company uses internally designed  applications specific integrated circuits asic  some of which are sole sourced  on some of its products as well as standard off the shelf items presently available from two or more suppliers 
historically the company has not experienced any significant problems in maintaining an adequate supply of these parts sufficient to satisfy customer demand  and the company believes that it has good relations with its vendors 
the company generally does not manufacture products to stock in finished goods inventory  as substantially all of the company s production is dedicated to specific customer purchase orders 
as a result  the company does not have any material requirements to maintain significant inventories or other working capital items 
intellectual property and patents while the company believes that its success is ultimately dependent upon the innovative skills of its personnel and its ability to anticipate technological changes  its ability to compete successfully will depend  in part  upon its ability to protect proprietary technology contained in its products 
the company does not currently hold any patents relative to its current product lines 
instead  the company relies upon a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in its products 
the development of alternative  proprietary and other technologies by third parties could adversely affect the competitiveness of the company s products 
further  the laws of some countries do not provide the same degree of protection of the company s proprietary information as do the laws of the united states 
finally  the company s adherence to industry wide technical standards and specifications may limit the company s opportunities to provide proprietary product features capable of protection 
the company is also subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
infringement claims could require the company to expend significant time and money in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing technology or acquire licenses to the technology which is the subject of asserted infringement

employees at december   the company had full time employees  of which were engaged in manufacturing and quality assurance  in research and development  in sales  sales support  service and marketing and in general management and administration 
the company s success to date has been significantly dependent on the contributions of a number of its key technical and management employees 
the company does not maintain life insurance policies on its key employees and  does not have employment agreements with key employees except for a few executive officers 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
none of the company s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there have been no work stoppages 
additionally  the company considers its relationship with its employees to be good 
competition the computer network industry is intensely competitive and is significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of industry participants 
the company expects substantial competition to continue 
the company s competition includes vendors specifically dedicated to the mass storage controller and computer network product markets 
traditionally the company s major oem customers have chosen not to manufacture adapters for their products or do not manufacture sufficient quantities or types of controllers to meet their needs 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share

year the company has recognized the need to ensure that its operations and relationships with vendors and other third parties will not be adversely impacted by software processing errors arising from the calculations using the year yk and beyond 
the company has created a company wide yk team to identify and resolve yk issues associated with the company s internal information systems  internal non information systems  the products sold by the company  and its major suppliers of products and services 
the company established a yk program coordinator to ensure these programs are implemented across the company 
the coordinator provides a single point of reference  both internal  and external  for the company 
the products that the company sells are yk compliant  or will be compliant by mid year the company s internal reporting system is being replaced with a yk compliant enterprise reporting planning erp system which is scheduled to go live in mid year in addition  the company is communicating with all its suppliers  customers  vendors and financial service organizations regarding their year compliance 
the company anticipates that its full year review  new information system implementation  and other necessary remediation actions will be substantially complete by mid direct expenditures are expected to be between  and  the company will fund these expenditures through its normal operating budget  and as required by generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are being expensed as incurred  excluding the capitalization of application software 
the capitalization for software will be approximately  the company does not believe that the costs associated with such actions will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however the costs of such actions may vary from quarter to quarter  and there is no assurance that there will not be a delay in the company s implementation or increased costs associated with the implementation of such changes 
failure to achieve yk readiness for the company could delay its ability to manufacture and ship products and deliver services 
the company s inability to perform these functions could have an adverse effect on future results of operations or financial condition 
non it systems include  but are not limited to  telephone pbx systems  fax machines  facilities systems regulating alarms  building access and sprinklers  manufacturing  assembly and distribution equipment  and other miscellaneous systems and processes 
yk readiness for these internal non it systems is the responsibility of the company s yk coordinator  it is anticipated at all non it systems will be compliant if they are not already compliant by mid the company regularly reviews and monitors the suppliers yk readiness plans and performance 
based on the company s risk assessment  selective on site reviews may be performed 
in some cases  to meet yk readiness  the company has replaced suppliers or eliminated suppliers from consideration for new business 
the company has also contracted with multiple transportation companies to provide product delivery alternatives 
while the company has contingency plans in place to address most issues under its control  an infrastructure problem outside of its control could result in a delay in product shipments depending on the nature and severity of the problems 
the company would expect that most utilities and service providers would be able to restore service within days although more pervasive system problems involving multiple providers could last two to four weeks or more depending on the complexity of the systems and the effectiveness of their contingency plans 
although the company is dedicating substantial resources towards attaining yk readiness  there is no assurance it will be successful in its efforts to identify and address all yk issues 
even if the company acts in a timely manner to complete all of its assessments  identifies  develops and implements remediation plans believed to be adequate  and develops contingency plans believed to be adequate some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the company 
the discussion above regarding estimated completion dates  costs  risks and other forward looking statements regarding yk is based on the company s best estimates given information that is currently available and is subject to change 
as the company continues to progress with its yk initiatives  it may discover that actual results will differ materially from these estimates 
use of forward looking statements certain statements contained in md a are forward looking  including statements concerning expected expenses  year readiness  and the adequacy of the company s sources of cash to finance its current and future operations 
factors which could cause actual results to materially differ from management s expectations include the following general economic conditions and growth in the high tech industry  competitive factors and pricing pressures  changes in product mix  the timely development and acceptance of new products  inventory risks due to shifts in market domain  year readiness of the company s suppliers  and the risks described from time to time in the company s sec filings
