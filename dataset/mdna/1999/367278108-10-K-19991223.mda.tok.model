the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may be deemed to contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including  but not limited to  future sales  gross margins  product development  operating expense levels  and the sufficiency of financial resources to support future operations  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by that statute 
such statements are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and under the heading additional risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to any forward looking statements  which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
overview the company currently has only one principal product line and is a leading developer and supplier of a portfolio of products and services used in the fabrication of advanced integrated circuits ics and flat panel displays fpds 
the company s products consist of photoresist removal systems  residual removal systems  isotropic etch systems and high pressure furnaces for the semiconductor industry and low pressure chemical vapor deposition systems lpcvd for the flat panel display industry 
in addition  the company provides spare parts and upgrades  as well as maintenance and support services the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the company anticipates that factors continuing to affect its future operating results will include the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the markets served by the company s customers including the recent  prolonged and severe downturn in the worldwide semiconductor industry  the timing of significant orders  patterns of capital spending by customers  the proportion of international sales to net sales  changes in pricing by the company  its competitors  customers or suppliers  market acceptance the company s products  the mix of products sold  financial systems  procedures and controls  credit terms  discounts  the timing of new product announcements and releases by the company or its competitors  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders due to customer financial difficulties or otherwise  the company s ability to produce systems in volume and meet customer requirements  the ability of any customer to finance its purchases of the company s equipment  changes in overhead absorption levels due to changes in the number of systems manufactured  political and economic instability and lengthy sales cycles 
the company s gross margins have varied and will continue to vary materially based on a variety of factors including the mix and average selling prices of systems sales  the mix of revenues  including service and support revenues  overhead absorption levels  utilization of field service and support resources  and costs associated with new product introductions and enhancements and the customization of systems 
furthermore  announcements by the company or its competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of the company s existing systems  which would also materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales in fiscal has decreased from fiscal and fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net sales has decreased from fiscal principally due to an increased underabsorption of manufacturing overhead and underutilization of the field service and support infrastructure resulting from lower revenues due to the prolonged and severe worldwide semiconductor business slowdown that has occurred during these periods 
in addition  gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by approximately million of charges to increase reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data of the company expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated years ended september  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses costs associated with reduction in force  
provision for uncollectible account research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest expense 
interest and other income 
gain on sale of investment income loss before provision credit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales 
net sales consist of revenues from system sales  spare part and upgrade sales and maintenance and support 
net sales in fiscal of million decreased from million in fiscal and decreased from million in fiscal the severe worldwide business slowdown in the semiconductor industry  which resulted in many ic manufacturers in nearly all geographic regions reducing and delaying capital equipment purchases  is the principal reason for the decrease in sales from year to year 
this industry slowdown was largely due to a dram supply and demand imbalance  depressed dram pricing and the poor economic climate in asia and japan 
additionally  logic and microprocessor manufacturers were adversely impacted by price decreases resulting from low cost personal computers pcs 
as a result of the above  the company experienced lost orders  delays in receiving new orders and rescheduling or cancellations of previously ordered equipment by north america and asian customers  in particular  which materially adversely affected sales for all of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal however  beginning in fiscal  the industry climate began to slowly improve and sequential improvement in quarter to quarter sales began in the second fiscal quarter and continued throughout the balance of fiscal assuming the global semiconductor industry continues to recover  the company anticipates that quarter to quarter sales for at least the first half of fiscal will increase moderately compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal international sales  which are predominantly to customers based in europe  japan and asia pacific  accounted for approximately  and of total net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales to customers in north america were of total net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in europe  sales decreased to of total net sales in fiscal from in fiscal and increased from of total net sales in fiscal the decrease in european net sales for fiscal from fiscal can be attributed primarily to the lack of investment in new fabrication facilities or expansions during fiscal for japan and asia pacific  sales increased to of total net sales in fiscal from in fiscal and decreased from in fiscal the decrease in the japan and asia pacific sales in fiscal and fiscal from fiscal is attributable primarily to the financial crisis in parts of that region and a significant sale in thailand recorded early in fiscal that was written off in the third quarter of fiscal as an uncollectible account receivable see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company continued to invest significant resources in international markets  particularly in japan  singapore  taiwan  and the united kingdom during fiscal in an attempt to increase its global market share 
the company s percentage of international sales will continue to fluctuate from period to period  but the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales in fiscal gross margin 
the company s gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in gross margin for fiscal years and primarily reflects the impact of the company s under absorbed manufacturing overhead and under utilization of its field service and support infrastructure resulting from lower overall net sales 
the decrease also resulted from lower sales volume of the company s more mature  higher margin single chamber systems as well as competitive pricing pressures 
additionally  gross margin in fiscal was negatively impacted by approximately million of charges to increase reserves for potentially excess manufacturing and spare parts inventory resulting from the reduction in product demand and for certain obsolete finished units 
the charge related to finished units was for certain older generation single chamber products which have not met sales expectations 
this reserve was also driven partially by the success of the company s performance enhancement platform pep in that customers have transitioned to the multi chamber pep platform faster than anticipated resulting in reduced demand for single chamber systems 
the company expects that its gross margin will continue to be materially adversely impacted by inefficiencies associated with new product introductions  sales of lower margin multi chamber and flat panel display systems  competitive pricing pressures  the semiconductor industry climate  the economic troubles still being experienced by many countries in asia  including companies in some of the company s major markets such as japan and korea  changes in product mix and other factors 
the company will continue to focus on its gross margin improvement programs  including the introduction of new value added applications  features and options on the pep systems  targeted cost reduction programs and controlled spending 
the company expects that its gross margin rates during fiscal will be slightly higher as compared to prior year comparable periods due to higher sales levels resulting in increased overhead absorption and better utilization of field service and support resources 
provision for uncollectible account 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an expense of million related to the write off of an uncollectible account receivable see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
costs associated with reduction in force 
in fiscal and  the company reduced its workforce in response to market conditions and recorded a charge of  and million  respectively  primarily for costs of severance compensation and consolidation of facilities 
as of september  approximately of the million has been paid and approximately  remains on the company s books as an accrual 
research and development r d 
the company s r d expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and from in fiscal due in large part to significantly lower sales volume 
in absolute dollars  r d expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and increased slightly from million in fiscal the million decrease in r d spending in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the cumulative impact of three reductions in force that occurred in the second half of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal year  a charge of  recorded in fiscal related to accelerated write downs of certain older generation applications development equipment and consulting charges and  due to the reprioritization of engineering projects 
partially offsetting the above was a million charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal primarily for the accelerated write off of equipment produced and used in connection with the company s first generation mm product development program 
this equipment which consisted primarily of mm tools produced for test  demonstration and evaluation had significantly declined in value since the company has now transitioned to the next generation of mm product development 
the increase in r d spending in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to the development of several new product and process capabilities for advanced photoresist and advanced clean applications utilizing the company s pep platform and for the development of a mm platform 
expenses for fiscal also included the  in charges mentioned above for the accelerated write downs of certain older generation development equipment and consulting charges 
the company continues to focus its r d efforts on areas where it believes it may be able to gain market share 
in particular  the company has focused its r d spending on programs to support the expanding number of available applications that target our integrated clean strategy  the development of the mm platform  the support of the lcd flat panel business and applications development of the vhp technology 
in june  the company formally introduced the pep iridia which is a leading edge solution targeting the growing market for application specific photoresist and wafer cleaning steps 
the company anticipates that r d spending in absolute dollars for fiscal will be slightly higher when compared to fiscal excluding the million write off discussed above 
this increase will likely be due primarily to the fact that the company was on a reduced work schedule for the first half of fiscal  the company increased salaries in the fourth quarter of fiscal and scheduled salary increases in the second quarter of fiscal and  a week fiscal year compared to a week fiscal year selling  general and administrative sg a 
the company s sg a expenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to from in fiscal and from in fiscal due to significantly lower sales volume 
the spending decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal results in part from charges taken in the third quarter of fiscal for the consolidation of the company s san jose  california operations of approximately  and for the write down of older generation demonstration and evaluation equipment of approximately  the balance of the decrease primarily results from the cumulative impact of the company s three reductions in force and lower third party sales commissions on international sales 
for approximately the last three years  the company has built a worldwide direct sales and support organization which has decreased the company s dependence on third party representatives for these services 
consequently  third party commissions in all but three regions have been eliminated  partially offset by increased expenses related to the hiring of and other expenses associated with building the company s direct sales and support organizations 
sg a expenses in fiscal were lower than fiscal primarily due to reductions in force that occurred in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  reduced work schedules and shutdown days during fiscal and lower third party sales commission on international sales 
these expense reductions were partially offset by the  equipment write down mention above 
the company currently anticipates that sg a expenses for fiscal will increase from fiscal due to the company s reduced work schedule for much of fiscal  salary increases  hiring and other related expenses needed to support anticipated increases in business activities during fiscal other income expense 
other income and expense generally consists of interest expense  interest income  currency translation gains and losses  royalty income and gains on sales of stock of a third party 
interest expense of approximately   and  was incurred by the company in fiscal  and  respectively  primarily as a result of borrowings under a short term credit facility from the bank of tokyo mitsubishi by the company s wholly owned japanese subsidiary  gasonics international japan kk as of september   borrowings under this loan agreement were approximately million yen  which is equivalent to approximately million 
the increase in interest and other income in fiscal from fiscal primarily reflects an increase in interest income received principally from the company s short term investments 
this increase resulted from a change in the company s investment portfolio early in fiscal from tax exempt securities to taxable securities since the company is not incurring a tax liability due to its net operating losses 
this increase was partly offset by a decrease in interest income received on a combined decrease of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that were used to fund operating and investing activities 
the increase in interest and other income in fiscal from fiscal is primarily due to royalty income received in connection with the sale of the company s industrial plasma cleaning products and services business that was sold in july in fiscal and royalty income was  and  respectively 
there was no royalty income recorded in fiscal foreign exchange currency translations were a net loss for fiscal  and of approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in the loss from fiscal to fiscal primarily reflects currency translation impact of a strengthening us dollar against the japanese yen that has occurred during net income for fiscal was favorably impacted by sales of shares held by the company in a third party corporation  which shares were received in exchange for technology and certain services rendered in fiscal the company realized pretax gains in fiscal year of approximately  from this sale see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there was no such gains recorded in fiscal or fiscal as the last shares were sold in fiscal provision for income taxes benefits 
the company did not record a provision for tax benefits related to the year ended september  net loss because the net loss cannot be carried back to offset previous amounts of taxable income 
the tax loss and other tax benefits will be carried forward and will be available to offset certain future tax liabilities 
the company does not anticipate recording these tax benefits until returning to profitability 
the company had an effective tax benefit rate of in fiscal and an effective tax rate of in fiscal year the company recognized a tax benefit in fiscal due to a carry back of current net operating losses to prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by million to million at september  from million at september  operations used cash of approximately million in fiscal and provided cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
investing activities used cash of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively for the acquisition of equipment 
capital spending in fiscal years included approximately million for the purchase and installation of a new management information system 
investing activities for the purchase and sale of marketable securities provided cash of approximately million in fiscal  used cash of approximately million in fiscal and provided cash in fiscal of approximately million 
financing activities in fiscal  and provided cash of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the sale of stock under the company s employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
in addition   and  was provided in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  from borrowings by the company s japanese subsidiary  gasonics international japan kk  under its line of credit facility with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi btm 
in fiscal  financing activities used cash of approximately million for the open market repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock and in fiscal  used cash of approximately million to repay a loan by gasonics international japan kk to btm and acquired a new credit facility with the same bank 
at september  borrowings under this the line of credit agreement with btm totaled million see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at september   the company had working capital of approximately million 
accounts receivable increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of fiscal primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal inventories decreased to million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the end of fiscal due principally to the reductions in excess inventories 
the company expects future inventory levels to fluctuate from period to period  and believes that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of its equipment  its investment in inventories will continue to require a significant portion of working capital 
as a result of such investment in inventories  the company may be subject to an increasing risk of inventory obsolescence  which could materially adversely affect the company s operating results 
at september   the company s principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  million in marketable securities  and million available under the company s unsecured working capital line of credit with union bank of california which was renewed on june  and expires on march  a commercial letter of credit provision of  is also provided under the line of credit 
this line of credit bears interest at the bank s libor rate plus per annum 
available borrowing under the credit line is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
as of september   except for  outstanding under the letter of credit provision  there were no borrowings under this line 
this line of credit contains certain covenants  including covenants relating to financial ratios and tangible net worth which must be maintained by the company 
as of september   the company was in compliance with its bank covenants 
the company s wholly owned japanese subsidiary  gasonics international japan kk  has a credit facility with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi with an available credit line of million japanese yen which  as of september   is equivalent to approximately million us dollars 
this credit facility was renewed on october   bears interest at a rate of per annum  is secured by a letter of guarantee issued by the company and expires on march  as of september   gasonics international japan kk had borrowed million yen under this credit facility  which is equivalent to approximately million as of that date 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and available lines of credit at september  are sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements during the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to achieve its working capital or capital equipment needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required or  if available  will be on reasonable terms 
year readiness disclosure the year compliance issue in which systems do not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to creates certain risks for the company 
to address the issue  the company assembled a task force to assure that the products and systems supplied to the company and the products the company supplies to its customers  are year compliant and to review and assess internal software  data management  accounting  manufacturing and operational systems to ensure that they do not malfunction as a result of the year date transition 
the company is working with its significant suppliers and has prepared a contingency plan to address the possibility that one or more suppliers may not be able to provide year compliant products or services in a timely manner 
the company s contingency plans address alternative solutions including alternative sources for such products or services 
with respect to compliance of the products the company supplies to its customers  the company has adhered to year test case scenarios established by sematech  an industry group comprised of us semiconductor and semiconductor equipment manufacturers 
there can be no assurance that the company s products do not contain  and will not continue to contain  undetected errors associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to the company  including increased repair and warranty costs and costs incurred in litigation due to any such defects 
the company relies heavily on its existing application software and operating systems for its internal operations 
if internal data management  accounting and or manufacturing or operational software and systems do not adequately or accurately process or manage day or date information beyond the year  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company s failure to ensure year compliance of its internal systems may cause disruption in the company s automated accounting  financial planning  data management and manufacturing operations which could have a material effect on the company s short term ability to manage its day to day operations in an efficient  cost effective and reliable manner 
assessment and corrective measures were conducted in parallel 
these assessment and corrective measures encompassed all significant categories of systems used by the company  including data management  accounting  manufacturing  sales  human resources and operational software and systems 
the company s assessment  corrective measures and contingency planning to resolve all material internal programs and systems is completed 
in connection with the company s assessment and corrective measures  both to ensure that the operating systems accompanying its products and that its internal products and systems  are year compliant  the company has replaced some software and systems and upgraded others where appropriate 
where the company cannot upgrade certain components of its current products  the company has replaced non compliant operating systems with systems demonstrated to be year compliant in both new products and installed products 
with respect to products no longer offered by the company but still in use  the company has offered  for a fee  to upgrade to make year compliant those products that are upgradable and has offered alternative solutions for those products that are not upgradable 
with respect to products and systems supplied to the company for use internally  the company has upgraded all material non compliant products and systems and  where necessary or where no reasonable upgrade is available  replaced such non compliant products and systems with products and systems demonstrated to be year compliant 
the company has identified for its customers the corrective measures necessary to ensure that its installed products are year compliant  including compliance of third party products such as software incorporated into the company s installed products 
in this regard  the company is incurring  and will continue to incur throughout calendar  various expenses to provide customer support regarding year issues  and certain of such expenses are expected to be passed on to the company s customers 
the company s failure to ensure  at all or in a timely or reasonable manner  that its products are year compliant may cause disruption in the customer s ability to derive expected productivity from those products or to integrate the products fully and functionally into certain automated manufacturing environments and  therefore  could lead to increased customer dissatisfaction  increased warranty and repair costs and claims for lost productivity or business by customers  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company estimates that the costs directly related to addressing year issues  will be between and million  of which approximately million had been spent as of september  there can be no assurance that the company s current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to the company  including repair costs  warranty costs and costs incurred in litigation due to any such defects 
additionally  there can be no assurance that unexpected delays or problems  including the failure to ensure year compliance by systems and products supplied to the company by a third party  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial performance  or the competitiveness or customer acceptance of its products 
the company could be subject to litigation in the event that any of its products  including third party components  are not year compliant  which could be substantial and costly 
the company s current understanding of expected costs is subject to change as the company s review continues and does not include potential costs related to customer claims  or internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business where installation otherwise may be accelerated to provide solutions to year compliance issues 
although the company is unaware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year as of this date  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs  including a material disruption in the company s operations  caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal operating systems  which are composed predominantly of third party software and hardware technology 
additional risk factors significant fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the company anticipates that factors continuing to affect its future operating results will include the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the markets served by the company s customers  particularly the recent prolonged  severe worldwide semiconductor slowdown  the timing and terms of significant orders  patterns of capital spending by customers  the proportion of direct sales and sales through distributors  the proportion of international sales to net sales  changes in pricing by the company  its competitors  customers or suppliers  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  inventory obsolescence  accounts receivable write offs  the mix of products sold  financial systems  procedures and controls  discounts  the timing of new product announcements and releases by the company or its competitors  delays  cancellations or rescheduling of orders due to customer financial difficulties or otherwise  the company s ability to produce systems in volume and meet customer requirements  the ability of any customer to finance its purchases of the company s equipment  changes in overhead absorption levels due to changes in the number of systems manufactured  political and economic instability throughout the world  particularly in the asia pacific region  and lengthy sales cycles 
the company s gross margins have varied and will continue to vary materially based on a variety of factors including the mix and average selling prices of systems sales  the mix of revenues  including service and support revenues  and the costs associated with new product introductions and enhancements and the customization of systems 
furthermore  announcements by the company or its competitors of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of the company s existing systems  which would also materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience decreased sales of its single chamber products due to the introduction of the pep dual chamber systems 
the company s gross margin and overall gross margin rate has sharply declined from the level attained in prior years  in part  due to an increased under absorption of manufacturing overhead and under utilization of the field service and support infrastructure resulting from lower net sales  changes in product mix from fewer higher margin rate and mature single chamber products to lower margin rate dual chamber products  start up inefficiencies associated with new products  competitive pricing pressures  products sold by the company s liquid crystal display manufacturing equipment lcd division in japan  and other factors 
additionally  the company s sales and earnings for approximately the last two years were materially adversely affected by the worldwide semiconductor business slowdown 
beginning in fiscal  the industry showed signs of an initial recovery and the company s revenues improved sequentially quarter to quarter beginning with the second quarter of fiscal although the company currently anticipates that revenues for at least the first two quarters of fiscal will increase moderately from the level achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or even maintain its sales at current levels 
limited system sales  backlog the company derives a substantial portion of its sales from the sale of systems which typically range in price from approximately  to  for its photoresist and post etch residue removal systems and up to approximately million or more for many of its other products 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition for even a single transaction has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s sales and operating results 
the company s backlog at the beginning of a quarter typically does not include all sales required to achieve the company s sales objectives for that quarter 
moreover  all customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalties and  therefore  backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales to be expected for any succeeding period 
the company has in the past experienced  and expects to continue to experience  cancellations and rescheduling of orders 
as a result  the company s net sales and operating results for a quarter depend upon the company obtaining orders for systems to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order is received 
the company s business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment during such period 
furthermore  most of the company s quarterly net sales have recently been realized near the end of the quarter 
a delay in a shipment near the end of a particular quarter due  for example  to an unanticipated shipment rescheduling  to cancellations or deferrals by customers  to unexpected manufacturing difficulties experienced by the company  additional customer configuration requirements or to supply shortages  may cause net sales in a particular quarter to fall significantly below the company s expectations and may materially adversely affect the company s operating results for any such quarter 
in addition  significant investments in research and development  capital equipment and customer service and support capability worldwide have resulted in significant fixed costs which the company has not been and will not be able to reduce rapidly if sales goals for a particular period are not met 
because the company builds its systems according to forecast  a reduction in customer orders or backlog will lead to excess inventory and possibly inventory obsolescence  increased costs and reduced margins which could materially adversely effect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s operating results in any future period cannot be forecasted accurately 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cyclicality of semiconductor industry the company s business depends in significant part upon capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductor devices  including manufacturers that are opening new or expanding existing fabrication facilities which  in turn  depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for such devices and products utilizing such devices 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and historically has experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment  including systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
beginning in  the worldwide semiconductor industry has experienced a severe cyclical downturn  which extended throughout during this period  the company has experienced significant cancellations and delays of new orders and rescheduling of existing orders that have materially adversely affected the company s financial results 
in early  the industry began what appears to be a slow recovery 
the company can give no assurance that it will be able to increase or even maintain its current level of sales 
additionally  the company anticipates that a significant portion of new orders will depend upon demand from ic manufacturers building or expanding large fabrication facilities  and there can be no assurance that such demand will exist in the near future or at all 
see business industry background 
highly competitive industry the semiconductor capital equipment industry is intensely competitive 
a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor production line 
as a result  once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier s product  the manufacturer often relies for a significant period of time upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same supplier 
accordingly  it is difficult for the company to sell to a particular customer for a significant period of time once that customer selects a competitor s product 
the company currently has only one principal product line and experiences intense competition worldwide from a number of foreign and domestic manufacturers  including canon  applied materials  inc  eaton corporation  lam research corporation  matrix semiconductor systems  inc  mattson technology  inc  plasma systems and mc electronics  some of which have substantially greater installed bases and greater financial  marketing  personnel  technical and other resources than the company 
the company believes that the industry will continue to be subject to increased consolidation which will increase the number of larger more powerful companies in the industry sector in which the company competes 
certain of the company s competitors have announced the introduction of  or have introduced or acquired  competitive products that offer enhanced technologies and improvements 
for example  applied materials and lam research have modules on their products which remove photoresist using dry chemical processing and  therefore  compete with the company s products 
the company expects its competitors to continue to develop  enhance or acquire competitive products that may offer improved price or performance features 
new product announcements  introductions and enhancements by the company s competitors could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s systems in addition to intense price competition or could otherwise make the company s systems or technology obsolete or non competitive 
in addition  by virtue of its reliance on sales of advanced dry chemistry processing equipment  the company could be at a disadvantage compared to certain competitors that offer more diversified product lines 
the company believes that it will continue to face competition from current and new suppliers employing other technologies  such as wet chemistry  traditional dry chemistry and other techniques  as such competitors attempt to extend the capabilities of their existing products 
increased competitive pressure has led and may continue to lead to reduced demand and lower prices for the company s products  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
the company believes that to remain competitive it will have to commit significant financial resources to develop new product features and enhancements  to introduce next generation photoresist and residue removal products on a timely basis  and to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide 
in marketing its products  the company will face competition from suppliers employing new technologies in order to extend the capabilities of competitive products beyond their current limits or increase their productivity 
in addition  increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition  resulting in lower prices and margins  which would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
competitors of the company s lcd division in japan include japan based companies and japan based joint ventures such as applied komatsu  koyo lindbergh and ulvac 
these competitors manufacture alternative technology systems and are well established in japan and they could  at any time  enter the company s markets with improved technology or with systems that are directly competitive with those of the company s lcd division 
late in fiscal  the company acquired its lcd division in japan  but to date  this has not enabled the company to significantly penetrate the photoresist removal market in japan 
japanese ic process equipment manufacturers dominate the market for certain types of integrated circuits which use the company s systems 
japanese manufacturers are well established in the japanese process equipment market  making it difficult for non japanese manufacturers to penetrate the japanese market 
furthermore  japanese semiconductor manufacturers have extended their influence outside of japan by licensing products and process technologies to non japanese semiconductor manufacturers 
such licenses could result in a recommendation to use certain semiconductor capital equipment manufactured by japanese companies 
the company has not established itself as a major competitor in the japanese market and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve significant sales to japanese ic manufacturers or compete successfully in the future 
see business competition 
dependence on key customers historically  the company has sold a significant proportion of its systems in any particular period to a limited number of customers 
sales to the company s ten largest customers in fiscal  and accounted for approximately   and of net sales  respectively 
in fiscal  intel accounted for greater than of net sales 
intel and motorola accounted for greater than of fiscal net sales 
in fiscal  samsung  promos technologies and intel each accounted for greater than of net sales 
the company expects that sales of its products to relatively few large customers will continue to account for a high percentage of net sales in the foreseeable future 
none of the company s customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase the company s products 
moreover  sales to certain of its customers have decreased as those customers have completed or delayed purchasing requirements for new or expanded fabrication facilities 
although the composition of the group comprising the company s largest customers has varied from year to year  the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders from any significant customer  including reductions due to customer departures from recent buying patterns  market  economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry or in the industries that manufacture products utilizing ics  has materially adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s ability to increase or maintain current sales levels in the future will depend  in part  upon its ability to obtain orders from new customers as well as the financial condition and success of its customers and the general economy  of which there can be no assurance

expansion of operations  management of growth since  the company has significantly increased the scale of its operations to support sales levels and  despite recent layoffs  has generally expanded its operations to address critical infrastructure requirements  including the hiring of additional personnel  commencement of independent operations in the united kingdom  ireland  france  germany  italy  korea  japan  singapore  taiwan and israel and significant investments in research and development to support product development 
the past growth in the company s sales and expansion in the scope of its operations has placed a considerable strain on its management  financial and other resources and has required the company to initiate an extensive reevaluation of its operating and financial systems  procedures and controls 
the company implemented new management information  manufacturing and cost accounting systems during the second quarter of fiscal and continues to upgrade and implement new management systems  particularly in the area of inventory control  to better enable it to manage its business 
there can be no assurance  however  that any existing or new systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support the company s operations or that its new systems will be implemented in a cost effective and timely manner 
rapid technological change  importance of timely product introduction the semiconductor manufacturing industry is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s ability to be competitive will depend in large part upon its ability to develop new and enhanced systems and to introduce these systems at competitive prices and in a timely and cost effective manner to enable customers to integrate the systems into their operations either prior to or upon commencement of volume product manufacturing 
in addition  new product introductions or enhancements by the company s competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
increased competitive pressure has led to intensified price based competition resulting in lower prices and margins  which has and could continue to materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
any success of the company in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends upon a variety of factors including product selection  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  effective sales and marketing and product performance in the field 
in particular  the company s future performance will depend in part upon the successful commercialization of the vhp  lpcvd systems and mm systems 
there can be no assurance that any such product will achieve significant revenues  if any  or enhance the company s profitability 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both the future demand for the type of ics under development by leading ic manufacturers and the equipment required to produce such ics 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or in enhancing existing products and any failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of the large number of components in  and the complexity of  the company s systems  significant delays can occur between a system s initial introduction and the commencement of volume production 
as is typical in the semiconductor capital equipment market  the company has experienced delays from time to time in the introduction of  and certain technical  quality and manufacturing difficulties with  certain of its systems and enhancements and may continue to experience delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new systems or enhancements 
the company s inability to complete the development or meet the technical specifications of any of its new systems or enhancements or to manufacture and ship these systems or enhancements in volume and in a timely manner would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations as well as its customer relationships 
in addition  the company may incur substantial unanticipated costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of its future product introductions early in the product s life cycle 
if new products have reliability or quality problems  the company may experience decreased sales  loss of customers  reduced orders or higher manufacturing costs  increased costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional service and warranty expenses  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

lengthy sales cycle sales of the company s systems depend  in significant part  upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity through the expansion of existing fabrication facilities or the opening of new facilities  which typically involves a significant capital commitment 
the company often experiences delays in finalizing system sales following initial system qualification while the customer evaluates and receives approvals for the purchase of the company s systems and completes a new or expanded facility 
due to these and other factors  the company s systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which the company may expend substantial funds and management effort which may not ultimately lead to actual sales 
the company believes that the length of the sales cycle will continue to increase as certain of its customers centralize purchasing decisions into one decision making entity and continue to be cautious in their purchase decisions due to the recent severe downturn in the semiconductor market  which is expected to intensify the evaluation process and require additional sales and marketing expenditures by the company 
lengthy sales cycles subject the company to a number of significant risks  including obsolescence and fluctuations and non predictability of operating results  over which the company has little or no control 
risks associated with the asia pacific market the company believes that increased penetration of the asia pacific market  particularly japan and taiwan  will be essential to its future financial performance 
to date  the company has sold relatively few systems to japanese semiconductor manufacturers 
sales in japan accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales in fiscal  of total net sales in fiscal and of total net sales in fiscal the japanese semiconductor market including fabrication plants operated outside of japan by japanese semiconductor manufacturers represents a substantial percentage of the worldwide semiconductor manufacturing capacity  and has been difficult for non japanese companies to penetrate 
furthermore  the licensing of products and process technologies by japanese semiconductor manufacturers to non japanese semiconductor manufacturers has resulted in recommendations to use certain semiconductor capital equipment manufactured by japanese companies 
late in fiscal  the company acquired its lcd division in japan  but to date  this has not enabled the company to significantly penetrate the photoresist removal market in japan 
as a relatively recent entrant  the company is at a distinct competitive disadvantage in the japanese market compared to leading japanese suppliers  many of which have long standing collaborative relationships with japanese semiconductor manufacturers 
in addition  since  japanese semiconductor manufacturers have substantially reduced their levels of capital spending on new fabrication facilities and equipment  particularly over the past two years due to the overall downturn in the japanese economy and the severe downturn in the worldwide semiconductor market  thereby  further increasing competitive pressures in the japanese market 
although the company is investing significant resources  and has established a direct presence in japan  which has and will significantly increase operating expenses  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve significant sales to the japanese semiconductor market  which failure could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
taiwan currently represents approximately of the worldwide demand for capital semiconductor equipment and this percentage is expected to increase in the future 
the success of the company will  in part  be dependent upon its ability to succeed in this very competitive marketplace 
currently  the company s primary competitors in the taiwan bulk ash market are mattson  plasma systems taiwan pst and kokusai  ramco kem 
the company s sales in taiwan accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales in fiscal and of total net sales in fiscal and in fiscal see business sales  service and customer support 
international sales international sales accounted for   and of net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company has established independent operations in the united kingdom  ireland  france  italy  germany  korea  japan  singapore  taiwan and israel 
the company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of net sales 
international sales are subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulty in satisfying existing regulatory requirements  exchange rates  foreign currency fluctuations  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability  potentially adverse tax consequences  natural disasters  outbreaks of hostilities  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  extended payment terms  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations 
the company is also subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and import and export regulations 
the company cannot predict whether tariffs  quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions will be implemented by the united states  japan or any other country upon the importation or exportation of the company s products in the future 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business sales  service and customer support 
intellectual property rights although the company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its technology adequately or that competitors will not develop similar technology independently 
there can be no assurance that any of the company s pending patent applications will be issued or that foreign intellectual property laws will protect the company s intellectual property rights 
patents issued to the company could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented and the rights granted thereunder may not provide competitive advantages to the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate the company s products or  if patents are issued to the company  design around the patents issued to the company 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  the company occasionally receives notices from third parties alleging infringement claims 
although there currently are no pending material claims or lawsuits against the company regarding any possible infringement claims  there can be no assurance that infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by the company s customers resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future against the company or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any such claims are asserted against the company  the company may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights if available on reasonable terms or at all 
any such license would increase the company s expenses and could cause a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company could decide  in the alternative  to resort to litigation to challenge such claims or enforce its proprietary rights 
litigation  even if unsuccessful  could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
sole or limited sources of supply  reliance on subcontractors  complexity in manufacturing process certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of the company s systems are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
specifically  the company relies on three companies for supply of the robotics  two other companies for microwave power supplies  two companies for platens  one company for magnetrons and one company for microwave applicators used in its products 
the company s lcd division in japan is heavily dependent on one key supplier for quartz fabrication used in its lpcvd and thermal annealing systems 
the company is exploring alternative sources or technology to provide back up for critical materials when the primary suppliers are unable to deliver 
in addition  the company has been establishing longer term contracts with these suppliers to mitigate the potential risks of inadequate supply of required components and control over pricing and timely delivery of components and subassemblies 
however  the company is relying increasingly on outside vendors to manufacture certain components and subassemblies 
the company s reliance on sole or a limited group of suppliers and the company s increasing reliance on subcontractors involve several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components and subassemblies 
because the manufacture of certain of these components and subassemblies is an extremely complex process and requires long lead times  there can be no assurance that delays or shortages caused by suppliers will not occur in the future 
certain of the company s suppliers have relatively limited financial and other resources 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require the company to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components internally could significantly delay the company s ability to ship its products  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business manufacturing 
future acquisitions in the future  the company may pursue acquisitions of additional product lines  technologies or businesses 
future acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company is inexperienced in negotiating  effecting and assimilating such acquisitions and all acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  personnel and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
from time to time  the company has engaged in preliminary discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines  technologies and businesses  however  there are currently no agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
in the event that such an acquisition does occur  there can be no assurance that such an acquisition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the company s financial performance will depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of its officers and key personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any key person could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the company s future operating results depend in part upon its ability to attract and retain other qualified management  engineering  financial and accounting  technical  marketing and sales and support personnel for its operations 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area where the company is based  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
the failure to attract or retain such persons could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental regulations the company is subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture the company s products 
the company believes that it is currently in compliance in all material respects with such regulations and that it has obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct its business 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production  alteration of its manufacturing process or cessation of operations 
such regulations could require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure by the company to control the use  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous or toxic substances could subject the company to significant liabilities and could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
effect of certain anti takeover provisions as of september   the company s officers  directors and members of their families who may be deemed affiliates of such persons beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders will be able to significantly influence the election of the company s directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  such as mergers and acquisitions  regardless of how other stockholders of the company may vote 
such a high level of ownership by such persons or entities may have a significant effect in delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of common stock 
certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation  stock option stock issuance plan  bylaws and delaware law may also discourage certain transactions involving a change in control of the company 
in addition to the foregoing  the ability of the company s board of directors to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company 
volatility of stock price the company believes that factors such as announcements of developments related to the company s business  fluctuations in the company s operating results  sales of the company s common stock into the market place  failure to meet or changes in analysts expectations  general conditions in the semiconductor industry or the worldwide economy  natural disasters  outbreaks of hostilities  announcements of technological innovations or new products or enhancements by the company or its competitors  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and developments in the company s relationships with its customers and suppliers could cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for shares of small capitalization stocks such as the company s  in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
moreover  in recent years the stocks of many companies in the semiconductor capital equipment business  including the stock of the company  have declined substantially due to the worldwide semiconductor downturn 
there can be no assurance that the market price of the company s common stock will not continue to experience significant fluctuations in the future  including fluctuations that are unrelated to the company s performance
