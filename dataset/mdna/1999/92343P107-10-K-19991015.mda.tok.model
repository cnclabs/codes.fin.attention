item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview most of fiscal was characterized by depressed commodity prices and a number of oil and gas company mergers  resulting in reduced exploration and geophysical spending 
management has undertaken certain initiatives in response to the current industry downturn to preserve our financial strength and flexibility 
since september  headcount has decreased from approximately  to  employees 
in addition  veritas dgc completed the decommissioning of its multi boat operation in the gulf of mexico in march all three decommissioned vessels were on short term charters and have been returned to the vessel owners 
veritas dgc conducts surveys on both an exclusive contract basis and a multi client basis 
when operating on an exclusive contract basis  veritas dgc s customer purchases all rights to the completed geophysical survey  including all related data and interpretive manipulations of the data 
when operating on a multi client basis  veritas dgc retains ownership of the survey and all associated data and seeks to license the survey to multiple customers 
in line with current industry trends  veritas dgc anticipates that multi client surveys will constitute a growing percentage of its revenues 
historically  veritas dgc has generally realized higher operating margins from multi client surveys than from surveys performed on an exclusive contract basis 
for the year ended july   geophysical services performed on a contract basis accounted for approximately of veritas dgc s revenues  and the licensing of multi client geophysical surveys accounted for the remaining of revenues 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues decreased by  to million from million in fiscal  due to the general downturn in exploration spending driven by depressed commodity prices 
multi client revenues decreased from the prior year  from million to million  while contract revenues decreased  from million to million 
due to veritas dgc s increased activity in the onshore multi client business  that revenue stream increased to million from million in the previous year  somewhat offsetting the offshore multi client revenue decline 
operating expenses 
costs of services decreased  from million to million  but as a percent of revenues increased from to 
the increase in expense as a percent of revenues was mainly due to significant price declines in the contract business and due to fixed cost elements in operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  from million to million  primarily due to million of capital expenditures over the past two years 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  from million to million  resulting primarily from the reduction of discretionary spending at corporate headquarters 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million to million due to the issuance in october of an additional million of the senior notes 
other income expense 
other income expense increased from income of  in fiscal to income of million in fiscal primarily due to net foreign currency losses of million in fiscal as compared with net foreign currency gains of million in fiscal interest income was approximately million in each of those years 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased from million to million as a result of the company s decreased profitability 
equity in earnings loss 
equity in earnings loss is related to the indonesian joint venture  which posted a loss of  for fiscal compared to a net profit of  in fiscal decreases in contract revenues and a relatively fixed cost base accounted for the decreased profitability for the fiscal year 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased by  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal multi client revenues increased  from million to million  primarily due to the large surveys in the deepwater gulf of mexico where industry interest in fiscal was high 
most of the us marine and processing resources were dedicated to multi client work in fiscal the onshore multi client business increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal contract revenues increased  from million to million  with the largest growth stemming from additional acquisition and processing capacity as well as increased operational efficiency 
the market for processing intensive pre stack time and depth migration was up significantly from fiscal as customers worked to analyze and interpret the massive d surveys shot in geologically complex areas 
operating expenses 
costs of services increased  from million to million  but as a percent of revenues decreased from to 
the improvement in operating margins is mainly attributable to significant sales and performance of multi client data surveys that generally have higher margins 
data processing operating margins also showed improvement due to more efficient equipment 
land and transition zone margins remained consistent 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased  from million to million  due to the large increase in capital expenditures over the past two years 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million to million  resulting primarily from the addition of staff to support our expanded operations and costs incurred in implementing new administrative and accounting systems and a more aggressive marketing strategy 
interest expense 
interest expense includes an  reduction in fiscal for interest capitalized on the build out of a newly chartered vessel 
other income expense 
other income expense increased from a loss of  to income of  primarily from interest income earned on higher average cash balances 
this increase was offset by net foreign currency losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign money markets 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased from million to million as a result of veritas dgc s increased profitability 
the effective tax rate increased from to due to the write off of certain of veritas dgc s investments in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses veritas dgc s internal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and cash flow from operations 
external sources include public and private financing  the unutilized portion of a revolving credit facility  equipment financing and trade credit 
management believes that these sources of funds are adequate to meet the liquidity needs of veritas dgc for fiscal as of july   veritas dgc had approximately million in senior notes outstanding due in october veritas dgc also has a revolving credit facility due july from commercial lenders that provides advances up to million 
advances  however  are limited by a borrowing base million at july  and bear interest  at veritas dgc s election  at libor or prime rate plus a margin based on certain financial ratios maintained by veritas dgc 
advances are secured by certain accounts receivable 
as of july   there were no outstanding advances under the credit facility  but million of the credit facility was utilized for letters of credit and an additional million is available for borrowings 
veritas dgc requires significant amounts of working capital to support its operations and fund capital spending and research and development programs 
veritas dgc s capital expenditure budget for fiscal is approximately million  which includes expenditures of approximately million to maintain or replace current operating equipment 
research and development expenditures for fiscal are budgeted at million 
veritas dgc has also increased its multi client activity and significantly expanded its multi client data library 
because of the elapsed time between survey execution  sale and ultimate cash receipt  multi client work generally requires greater amounts of working capital than contract work 
depending upon the timing of the sales of the multi client surveys and the contract terms relating to the collection of the proceeds from such sales  veritas dgc s liquidity may be affected 
veritas dgc seeks pre funding commitments from customers for a portion of the cost of these surveys 
however  because of market conditions  purchase commitment levels are currently much lower than in past years 
veritas dgc believes that these multi client surveys have good long term sales  earnings and cash flow potential  but there is no assurance that veritas dgc will recover the costs of these surveys 
in addition to the capital expenditure budget  the planned net investment in the multi client data library the change in the balance sheet account for fiscal is million 
veritas dgc will require substantial cash flow to continue operations on a satisfactory basis  complete its capital expenditure and research and development programs and meet its principal and interest obligations with respect to outstanding indebtedness 
while management believes that veritas dgc has adequate sources of funds to meet its liquidity needs  its ability to meet its obligations depends on its future performance  which  in turn  is subject to general economic conditions  business and other factors beyond veritas dgc s control 
key factors affecting future results will include utilization levels of acquisition and processing assets and the level of multi client data library sales  all of which are driven by exploration spending and  ultimately  by underlying commodity prices 
if veritas dgc is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise to comply with the terms of its revolving credit facility or indentures  it may be required to refinance all or a portion of its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
veritas dgc cannot make any assurances that it would be able to obtain such refinancing or financing  or any refinancing or financing would result in a level of net proceeds required 
to ensure that veritas dgc has available as many financing options as possible  a shelf registration allowing the issuance of up to million in additional debt and or equity was filed with the sec after the end of fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
year year issue 
some software applications  hardware  equipment and embedded chip systems identify dates using only the last two digits of the year 
these products may be unable to distinguish between dates in the year and dates in the year that inability referred to as the year issue  if not addressed  could cause applications  equipment or systems to fail or provide incorrect information after december   or when using dates after december  this in turn could have an adverse effect on veritas dgc  because it directly depends on its own applications  equipment and systems and indirectly depends on those of other entities with which veritas dgc interacts 
compliance program 
veritas dgc has prepared a formal plan to address year issues as they relate to veritas dgc s business and its operations 
in accordance with that plan  veritas dgc has evaluated all internal hardware and software used in its operations  including those used to support veritas dgc s activities  such as geophysical data acquisition and processing equipment and accounting and payroll systems 
veritas dgc s state of readiness 
in the ordinary course of business  veritas dgc has replaced a significant amount of its hardware and software with year compliant systems 
veritas dgc has also identified all external relationships  mainly suppliers and customers  and mailed each entity an internally prepared questionnaire regarding year issues 
responses returned indicate a state of readiness  and non responses do not pertain to critical systems 
currently  veritas dgc estimates that it will complete required remedial actions by november  contingency planning 
as part of the year project  veritas dgc has determined which of its business activities may be vulnerable to a year disruption 
an ongoing monitoring program and contingency procedures have been established in the event of unanticipated non compliance problems 
costs to address year compliance issues 
cost of compliance to date approximates  and veritas dgc is not aware of any material contingencies or costs that will be incurred in the future 
risk of non compliance 
while veritas dgc believes that its year compliance program has substantially reduced the risks associated with the year issue  there can be no assurance that each and every remedial action will be successful 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issues  veritas dgc cannot conclude that its failure or the failure of third parties to achieve year compliance will not adversely affect its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other since veritas dgc s quasi reorganization with respect to digicon inc on july   the tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization have been recognized through a direct addition to paid in capital  when realization is more likely than not 
additionally  the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization is subject to certain limitations 
for the year ended july   veritas dgc recognized million related to these benefits  due to increased profitability of veritas dgc s uk operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard requires companies to record derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  as appropriate  at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
veritas dgc will be required to implement this statement in its first quarter of fiscal veritas dgc believes that the implementation of this standard will not have a material adverse effect on veritas dgc s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity
