item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained in item of this report  and the notes thereto 
amounts reported here have been rounded to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event such amounts have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand 
general from its inception  the company has been engaged principally in the research  design  development and commercialization of an innovative  advanced zinc air battery 
until the end of  the main application for the company s technology has been a system for powering zero emission electric vehicles 
the electric fuel electric vehicle system consists of a refuelable zinc air battery comprised of a series of cells with removable zinc anode cassettes  a battery exchange system  a battery refueling system for refueling the depleted fuel cassettes  and a regeneration system for recycling the depleted cassettes 
in part  because the market for electric vehicles had not demonstrated previously anticipated levels of growth  in the latter part of the company began a strategic shift to expand its research and development activities into additional applications for its zinc air battery technology 
in january  the company announced the creation of three market related divisions to expand its zinc air battery technology for wider applications 
the three divisions are electric vehicle  consumer batteries  and defense and safety products 
in addition to its electric vehicle application  the company is focusing efforts in developing and commercializing its battery technology for consumer electronics  defense and safety applications 
the company is developing an advanced portable zinc air battery for the us army s communications electronics command cecom  has developed and is selling a signal light powered by water activated batteries for use in life jackets and other rescue apparatus the survivor locator light  and is developing and commercializing a primary battery for cellular telephones 
currently the company is only selling several models of the survivor locator light but expects to generate sales of primary batteries for cellular telephones during the company has experienced significant fluctuations in the sources and amounts of its revenues and expenses  and the company believes that the following comparisons of results of operations for the periods presented do not provide a meaningful indication of the development of the company 
during these periods  the company has received periodic lump sum payments relating to licensing and other revenues from its strategic partners  which have been based on the achievement of certain milestones  rather than ratably over time 
the company s expenses have been based upon meeting the contractual requirements under its agreements with various strategic partners and  therefore  have also varied according to the timing of activities  such as the need to provide prototype products and to establish and engineer refueling and regeneration facilities 
the company s research and development expenses have been offset  to a limited extent  by the periodic receipt of research grants from the chief scientist 
the company expects that  because of these and other factors  including general economic conditions and delays due to legislation and regulatory and other processes and the development of competing technologies  future results of operations may not be meaningfully compared with those of current and prior periods 
thus  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its past results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december   and  and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses during at approximately the same levels 
these losses may increase and be incurred over a longer period of time as the company expands its research and development activities and establishes production and facilities  and such losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
however  when its products are successfully commercialized  the company expects to derive revenues from the sale of batteries for portable electronic devices  components of the electric fuel electric vehicle system  including refueling and electric fuel services  defense and safety products manufactured by the company  as well as from licensing rights to the electric fuel technology to third parties 
there can be however  no assurance that the company will ever derive such revenues or achieve profitability 
functional currency the company s management considers the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which efl operates and  therefore  efl has adopted and is using the united states dollar as its functional currency 
further  the company believes that the operations of efl s subsidiaries are an integral part of the israeli operations 
while a significant proportion of efl s revenues have been denominated in deutsche marks as a result of its involvement in the deutsche post field test  based on the company s historical experience and the company s strategic objectives  management continues to consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which efl operates 
furthermore  revenues not related to the field test are primarily in us dollars 
transactions and balances originally denominated in united states dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income

results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   totaled million compared with million for during  the deutsche post and the company agreed to extend the operations of the field test through may  following the completion of the field test  the deutsche post and the company agreed to mutually release each other from any financial claims regarding the field test  including additional funding due the company or repaying advances made by the deutsche post to the company with respect to opel batteries  which as previously disclosed  were subject to a dispute 
consequently  revenues for were principally derived from recognizing the previously deferred advances  as well as from activities relating to the field test extension reflecting payment of expenses incurred by the company by the deutsche post 
additionally  the company recognized revenues from the sale of additional batteries to the deutsche post as well as sales of electric fuel vehicle batteries to edison termoelettrica  spa edison 
the company also recognized revenues from the sale of survivor locator lights 
the company recently signed an agreement with the united states department of transportation dot as part of a consortium that will seek to demonstrate the ability of the electric fuel battery system to power a full size  all electric transit bus 
the dot approved million in federal funding for the cost shared million program 
the company s share of the million cost is approximately million  of which will be reimbursed to the company out of the dot funds 
the company began recognizing revenues from the activities related to the dot program in the second half of since this is a cost shared program  expenses associated with the company s participation in the program will exceed the revenues to be earned from the program 
the dot program is expected to continue until the end of additionally  the company began recognizing revenues in connection with various defense r d contracts

in addition  the company recognized revenues from the supply of batteries and equipment to edison as well as from the sale of survivor lights to various customers in the united states  principally in the fourth quarter 
research and development expenses and cost of revenues totaled million during compared with million during the company believes that  given the company s stage of development  it is not yet meaningful to distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
in addition to the reduction in the overall expenses  the internal division of expenses also changed between the periods 
this was principally attributable to a reduction of expenses related to electric vehicle battery development  and most particularly expenses related to the deutsche post field test  which came to its conclusion during the second quarter of this overall reduction was partially offset by significant increases in the costs associated with consumer battery development  and production of increased quantities of survivor locator lights in the defense and safety division 
expenses also included a write off of certain production equipment related to the earlier generation field test version of the electric vehicle battery  for a net amount of approximately  during the fourth quarter of the company began dismantling the regeneration facility in bremen 
consequently  the remaining salvage value for the facility was reduced by  to a net book value of zero 
during the year ended december   the company recorded  of royalty bearing grants in connection with the company s research and development program 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million of royalty bearing grants in connection with the company s research and development program  including an increase of  in chief scientist grants in connection with the company s research and development program 
as previously announced  the company has entered into an agreement to complete development of a battery for powering transit buses  in connection with a program to develop a new hybrid propulsion system in conjunction with general electric corporate research and development general electric 
the program is being partially funded by the israel us binational industrial research and development bird foundation  and the company recorded  of royalty bearing grants in  in connection with this program 
the dot program noted above complements the bird program 
accordingly  the company expects that  for  expenditures in connection with the electric vehicle battery  will increase as compared to r d expenses and cost of operations related to consumer battery and defense and safety applications are also expected to continue to increase for  as the company intensifies its efforts in these new areas 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared with million in this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced salaries  professional fees and electric vehicle marketing expenses during the company expects increases in selling  general and administrative expenses during  particularly with respect to marketing expenses in consumer battery applications  as the company continues to expand the applications for its technology 
financial income  net of interest expense  exchange differentials  bank charges  and other fees  totaled approximately  in compared to  in the company  and its israeli subsidiary  efl  have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities incurred in and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
during  the company s german subsidiary had net losses  which under the german tax code were used to reduce previously accrued income taxes in the amount of  and  was recorded as a provision for taxes in another european subsidiary

the consumer battery segment did not produce any revenues in direct expenses including depreciation expense were   and  in the defense and safety  electric vehicle and consumer battery segments respectively 
net cost of fixed assets net of accumulated depreciation at december  in the defense and safety  electric vehicle and consumer battery segments was   and  respectively 
in  revenues were  for the defense and safety segment and  for the electric vehicle segment 
the consumer battery segment did not produce any revenues in direct expenses including depreciation expense were   in the defense and safety  electric vehicle and consumer battery segments respectively

years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   totaled million compared with million for the comparable period in revenues for included fees collected in relation to a rights agreement completed with vattenfall under which vattenfall exercised its right for a license to establish and operate the electric fuel infrastructure for the territory of sweden  denmark  norway  finland and st 
petersburg  russia 
additional revenues related to vattenfall will be recognized only after a definitive license agreement has been signed 
execution of the definitive license agreement will be decided upon by vattenfall only after completion of the field test in may additionally  the company completed recognition of revenues relating to its activities in connection with the deutsche post field test program 
for  the company and the deutsche post have agreed that  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  the deutsche post will cover direct operating costs of the bremen plant and the test vehicles until may  up to a maximum amount of dm million million 
the company also completed recognition of revenues from phase of its agreement with stn atlas elektronic gmbh stn to develop a high power zinc oxygen battery for torpedoes 
in addition  the company recognized revenues from the supply of batteries and equipment to edison  as well as from the sale of survivor lights to various customers in the united states  principally in the fourth quarter

research and development expenses and cost of revenues totaled million during compared with million during the research and development expenses and cost of revenues are net of million  representing utilization of a portion of the previously accrued provision for project losses 
the company believes that  given the company s stage of development  it is not  at this time  meaningful to distinguish between research and development expenses and cost of revenues 
the decrease in expenses from was principally attributable to a reduction of expenses in connection with the deutsche post field test  particularly the costs of the construction of the regeneration plant in bremen  and production costs related to the supply of batteries for the field test 
this overall decrease was partially offset by increased r d expenses  both for electric vehicles as well as for batteries for portable electronic devices  and production costs related to survivor locator lights 
during the year ended december   the company recorded million of royalty bearing grants in connection with the company s research and development program  including an increase of  in chief scientist grants in connection with the company s research and development program 
for the year ended december   the company recorded million of chief scientist grants 
since the deutsche post and the company have agreed to extend the operations of the field test through may   expenses related to the field test are expected to continue to be incurred through the second quarter of however  direct field test expenses during  in contrast to previous years  will be fully funded by the deutsche post 
during  the salvage value for the regeneration facility in bremen was reduced by million to a value of million to reflect the company s current expectations of the value of the plant at the end of the field test 
the reduction in salvage value was offset by the elimination of the provision for anticipated program losses in the amount of million 
r d expenses and cost of operations related to consumer battery and defense and safety applications are expected to increase significantly during  as the company intensifies its efforts in these new areas  while expenses related to electric vehicle development are expected to decrease in the provision for anticipated program losses previously recorded by the company was eliminated during as the company does not expect to incur losses during on the field test 
overall  the costs of the field test incurred by the company have exceeded the related program budgeted amounts by more than and during  the company  pursuant to the terms of the field test partners agreement  entered into discussions to obtain additional funding from the deutsche post 
to date  the company has not obtained any such funding  and accordingly  the company operated only a limited number of vehicles during in the fourth quarter of  the deutsche post requested that the company refund the sum of approximately dm million approximately million representing milestone payments on account of opel batteries  which are the subject of a dispute between the deutsche post and the company 
the advances were made in accordance with mutually agreed contractual milestones  previously acknowledged by the deutsche post as having been achieved  and therefore the company does not believe that it is required to refund any of the payments 
however  until the resolution of this issue  the company has deferred recognizing this amount in revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared with million in while there was a decrease in the overall amount  there were certain nonrecurring expenses included in  particularly a settlement arrangement with respect to a terminated consultant included in marketing expenses see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the above  there was an increase in selling general and administrative expenses of approximately  this was primarily attributable to increased salaries  fees and allocated overhead expenses with respect to the expanded geographic scope of the company s activities including the united states  scandinavia  and the far east  as well as from the company s diversification into new applications for its zinc air battery technology 
the company does not expect further increases in selling  general and administrative expenses for financial income  net of interest expense  exchange differentials  bank charges  and other fees  totaled approximately  in compared to  in the company  and its israeli subsidiary  efl  have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities incurred in and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
however  for  the company s european subsidiaries had net income  which arose as a result of intercompany transactions  and they have therefore recorded a provision for income taxes  in the amount of  the company reported a net loss of million in compared with a net loss of million in due to the factors cited above 
in  revenues were  for the defense and safety segment and  for the electric vehicle segment 
the consumer battery segment did not produce any revenues in direct expenses including depreciation expense were   and  in the defense and safety  electric vehicle and consumer battery segments respectively 
net cost of fixed assets net of accumulated depreciation at december  in the defense and safety  electric vehicle and consumer battery segments was   and  respectively 
no segment information has been presented for because the company s activities in that year were primarily related to electric vehicle activities 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company considers a product to be in year compliance if the product s performance and functionality are unaffected by processing of dates prior to  during and after the year the company has retained an outside consultant to assess the year compliance of the company s computer hardware and software  and other equipment of the company with embedded chips that may be date sensitive 
the consultant completed its initial assessment of the company s systems in march based on the initial review of the consultant  the company believes that its core computer systems and equipment are year compliant  and that the year issue will not materially affect the company s operations or business 
management expects that the expenses incurred and to be incurred in connection with the year issue will not materially exceed amounts budgeted for such matters 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and financial investments of approximately million compared with million as of december  the company used available funds in primarily for continued research and development expenditures  and other working capital needs 
the company increased its investment in fixed assets by  during the year ended december  following the reduction in the salvage value of the bremen facility and a write off of certain production equipment related to the earlier generation field test version of the electric vehicle battery  fixed assets amounted to million as at year end 
efl presently has a line of credit with the first international bank of israel ltd 
fibi the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at fibi s prime rate per annum  are unconditionally guaranteed by the company and are secured by a pledge of foreign currency deposits in the amount of nis  approximately  additionally the credit facility imposes financial and other covenants on efc and efl and presently expires on march   at which time the credit facility will be reviewed for renewal by fibi 
the credit facility provides efl with a line of credit in the maximum principal amount of nis million approximately  which can be used as credit support for various obligations of efl 
as of december   the bank had issued letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling approximately  the company has no long term debt outstanding  and is using its cash reserves and revenues from operations primarily to continue development of batteries for consumer electronic devices  as well as to participate in the bird dot electric vehicle programs 
furthermore  in  the company is planning to establish a commercial production line and prepare for market penetration of its new zinc air battery for cellular telephones 
accordingly  the company is seeking additional funding  including through the issuance of equity or debt securities  and is pursuing other options  such as joint ventures or other strategic relationships 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain any such additional funding 
if additional funding is not secured  the company will have to modify  reduce  defer or eliminate certain of its anticipated future commitments and or programs  in order to continue reduced operations 
approximately of the stock of the company s israeli based subsidiary  efl  is now owned directly  indirectly or by application of certain attribution rules by three united states citizens 
if at any time in the future  or more of the shares of efl are held or deemed to be held by five or fewer individuals including  if applicable  those individuals who currently own an aggregate of of the company who are united states citizens or residents  efl would satisfy the foreign personal holding company fphc stock ownership test under the internal revenue code and the company could be subject to additional us taxes on any undistributed fphc income of efl 
for  efl had no income which would qualify as undistributed fphc income 
however  no assurance can be given that in the future efl will not have income which qualifies as undistributed fphc income 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations historically  the majority of the company s revenues have been in us dollars  although a significant proportion of the company s revenues in were in deutsche marks  primarily related to the field test 
the company does not expect a significant amount of deutsche mark revenues in the united states dollar cost of the company s operations in israel  with regard to expenses incurred in nis  is influenced by the extent to which an increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in the past two years  inflation in israel has been more than fully compensated by the devaluation of the nis  and  accordingly  the dollar cost of the company s nis expenses has decreased 
even if the recent trend is reversed as was the case in previous years the company does not believe that continuing inflation in israel or delays in the devaluation of the nis are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  except to the extent that such circumstances have an impact on israel s economy as a whole 
in the years ended december   and in  the annual rates of inflation in israel were   and respectively  compared to the devaluation of the nis against the dollar during such periods of   and respectively 
effective corporate tax rate the company s production facilities in israel have been granted approved enterprise status under the israeli law for encouragement of capital investments  the investment law  and consequently are eligible for certain tax benefits for seven to ten years after they first generate taxable income provided the maximum period as prescribed by the investment law has not elapsed 
the company has elected to receive a grant of funds together with a reduced tax rate for the aforementioned period 
efl s effective corporate tax rate may be affected by the classification of certain items of income as being approved income for purposes of the approved enterprise law  and hence subject to a lower tax rate to  depending on the extent of foreign ownership of efl presently than is imposed on other forms of income under israeli law presently 
the effective tax upon income distributed by the company to its stockholders would be increased as a result of the withholding tax imposed upon dividends distributed by efl to efc  resulting in an overall effective corporate tax rate of approximately for income arising from efl s approved enterprises and regarding other income 
efc and efl have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december  and and  accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities paid in and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
during  the company s german subsidiary had net losses  which under the german tax code were carried back  causing a reduction in previously accrued income taxes 
for  the company s european subsidiaries had net income  which arose as a result of intercompany transactions  and they recorded a provision for income taxes 
as of december  the company has us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  which are available to offset future taxable income  expiring primarily in and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which are available to offset future taxable income  indefinitely
