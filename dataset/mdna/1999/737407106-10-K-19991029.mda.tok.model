while it is impossible to evaluate every aspect of year compliance  we believe that either of two events would be our most likely year worst case scenario 
the first would be from one or more of our sole or limited source suppliers to fail to be year compliant or to have its business negatively impacted by year issues of others 
the second would be delays in receiving orders or payments from customers due to year problems they experience 
at the present time  it is not possible to determine whether any of these events is likely to occur  or to quantify any potential negative impact they may have on our future results of operations and financial condition
