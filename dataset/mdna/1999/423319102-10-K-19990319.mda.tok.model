item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on may   the company acquired granville phillips company gpc 
gpc is a world leader in the development and manufacture of instrumentation for vacuum measurement and control used principally in the semiconductor  flat panel display and disk drive manufacturing processes 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and accordingly  the financial results of the company for all periods presented include the financial position  results of operations  stockholders equity  comprehensive income and cash flows of gpc 
results of operations compared with net sales for were million compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decline is attributable to the excess capacity in the worldwide semiconductor industry  combined with the economic slump in the pacific rim 
total gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for  compared to for the prior year 
the reduction in gross margin was caused by the substantial decline in production volume and the related increase in excess capacity and manufacturing unit costs 
research and development expenses for were million or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales for as industry conditions worsened during the year  the company delayed certain expenditures on projects it believed were not critical during the downturn 
despite the decline in the semiconductor capital equipment business environment and the continued weakness of the asian markets  the company continues to fund its long term strategic development programs 
these actions are expected to position the company for growth as the economics improve in the worldwide semiconductor industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in to million from million in the prior year 
this reduction in spending is primarily attributable to a decrease in variable compensation  lower sales commission expense and a reduction in advertising and promotional expenditures  which was partially offset by expenses associated with the opening of the company s sales office in japan 
during  the company incurred certain special charges 
in the second quarter  the company acquired gpc in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
direct acquisition costs  including professional fees and compensation expense for various incentive plans for certain gpc employees  amounted to million and were charged against results of operations 
during the third quarter  the company restructured its domestic operations to eliminate non strategic spending  while redirecting resources to the company s global customer support structure and other strategic initiatives and took a charge of million 
the restructuring included provisions for termination benefits of million paid to approximately personnel  million relating to the closing of a leased facility and million for the impairment of certain assets

in  the company had an operating loss before taxes due to merger  restructuring and special charges 
the company benefited from research and development and other tax credits 
the provision of is less than the federal statutory rate of because granville phillips company was an s corporation prior to the acquisition and  therefore  not subject to federal income tax 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in the company invested million  primarily in machinery and equipment  during as of december   there are no anticipated material future capital expenditures 
cash dividends paid to stockholders during were million compared to million for in october  the company s board of directors decided to reduce the quarterly dividend from

per common share due to the uncertain business environment in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
at december   the company had informal bank money market lines of credit of million 
there have been no borrowings under these agreements since since the agreements are informal and unused  terms would be negotiated as necessary 
the company does not anticipate utilizing these lines of credit in the near term 
the company manages its foreign exchange rate risk arising from intercompany foreign currency denominated transactions through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
the gains and losses on these transactions are not material 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued the company believes that existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  anticipated cash flow from operations and funds available under existing credit lines will be adequate to fund operations and that it has further financing options should additional funds be required 
results of operations compared with net sales for were million compared to million in  an increase of million 
the growth in sales resulted primarily from record sales of the company s cryogenic vacuum products and instruments for vacuum measurement and control  used principally by semiconductor manufacturers worldwide 
net sales showed sequential quarterly improvement during the first three quarters of as the global market for semiconductor capital equipment strengthened 
net sales decreased in the fourth quarter due to the downturn in the worldwide semiconductor industry 
total gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in compared with in the increase in gross profit was attributable to the efficiencies derived from the company s high production volumes and ongoing cost reduction initiatives 
research and development expenses increased to million or of net sales for compared to million or of net sales for this increase reflects continued funding by the company of long term strategic development programs in response to the increasing demand from the semiconductor industry for new products and product enhancements 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million or of net sales for compared to million or of net sales for the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and variable compensation expense  and to increased sales and marketing efforts worldwide 
royalty and equity income from the company s joint venture in japan improved million over interest and other income for was million compared with million for  reflecting higher cash and cash equivalent balances during the year 
the company s provision for income taxes was million and million in and  respectively 
the difference between the statutory federal tax rate of and the company s effective tax rate of and for and  respectively  is principally due to the impact of granville phillips company s status as an s corporation  which is not subject to federal income taxes

important factors that may cause the company s actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
the company s business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  which generally have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment and have affected the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that developments in the semiconductor industry or the semiconductor equipment industry will occur at the rate or in the manner expected by the company 
in addition to the cyclical nature  risks and uncertainties of the semiconductor industry  the company faces the following risks and uncertainties the need to continuously develop  manufacture and gain customers acceptance of new products and product enhancements  dependence on a limited number of customers the company s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of net sales  and its largest customer  applied materials  inc  accounted for approximately of net sales in  its ability to attract and retain certain key personnel  the ability of the company to protect its technology assets by obtaining and enforcing patents  dependence on sole and limited source suppliers for certain components and subassemblies included in the company s products and systems 
as a result of the part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued certain factors that may effect future results continued foregoing and other factors  the company may experience material fluctuations in its future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially affect its business  financial position  results of operations and stock price 
year the year problem refers to the potential for information systems to be unable to correctly recognize and process calendar dates and date sensitive information involving dates on or after january  the company is addressing its year risk within four categories internal business software  internal systems hardware and software  exclusive of business software  external suppliers of goods and services  and the company s products 
internal business software 
the company s internal business systems that collectively provide the major processing functions for its operations are not year compliant 
the remediation replacement of those systems was begun in mid and is scheduled for completion by march internal systems 
the company utilizes other systems exclusive of business systems discussed above to perform certain data processing  including computer based programs  networking equipment  laboratory equipment  building security and atmosphere control systems  fax and copy machines  and others 
starting in the first quarter of  the company initiated a comprehensive program to address year problems with such internal systems  consisting of forming a project team of representatives from across the company  inventorying and assessing each internal system to determine whether it was compliant or non compliant to year problems  and developing a plan to address all non compliant systems 
the company is on schedule with its remediation efforts and expects to be completed by june testing of each remediated initial system is performed at the time of such remediation 
additional testing will be performed during the second half of  focusing on those systems classified as high risk of failure as well as critical to the business 
independent organizations might be employed to assist the company as needed to test and verify such internal systems are year compliant 
external suppliers of goods and services 
starting in january  the company undertook a program to understand and mitigate year problems with those external suppliers who are crucial to the company s operations  including parts providers  carriers  telecommunications providers  utilities  financial institutions and others 
a series of questionnaires was sent to external suppliers 
as a result  the company has determined that the majority of the company s suppliers are either year compliant or are aware of the problem and have an active program underway to address their particular problems 
for each supplier who is not year compliant  the company has defined a contingency plan in case the supplier cannot or will not resolve its year problems in a timely part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year continued manner 
the plan elements differ for each supplier but generally consist of one or more actions such as work with the supplier to help resolve their year problems  develop alternative suppliers for sole source components  redesign products to negate the need for non compliant suppliers  maintain back up inventories of critical components to protect against temporary disruptions in supply  evaluate alternative component and product delivery mechanisms  and monitor those suppliers who have active year programs underway to verify progress against those suppliers scheduled milestones 
the company will continue these monitoring activities until satisfied that all crucial suppliers are year compliant 
in addition  the company has enhanced its new supplier qualification process to require new suppliers to be year compliant in all aspects of their operations and products 
the company s products 
certain of the company s products contain embedded software 
in  the company performed an assessment of all such software to determine year compliance 
as a result  the company believes that there are no material issues regarding the use of its products 
the company also has enhanced its product development and testing processes to ensure that all new products are year compliant 
the company estimates that the total cost associated with addressing the year problem is approximately million  of which approximately million has been incurred to date 
of the total cost  approximately million relates to new systems and has been capitalized  and the remainder has or will be expensed as incurred 
these cost estimates are approximate and subject to change due to unforeseen internal or external conditions 
while the company believes that it is addressing all material year problems  there are a number of risks associated with year  only some of which are within the control of the company 
these risks include unforeseen difficulties in completing certain year programs  an incomplete inventory of internal systems  and the failure of one or more suppliers to adequately address the year problem 
the company s year efforts are meant to help manage and mitigate these risks 
part ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the company s business is conducted outside of the united states through its foreign subsidiaries 
the foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency rate fluctuations  the company has entered into forward exchange contracts on a continuing basis to hedge the currency exposures 
gains and losses on forward exchange contracts qualifying for hedge accounting were immaterial for years presented and are classified in cost of sales 
the company plans to continue to use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in forward currency exchange rates at december   would be  the potential loss was estimated calculating the fair value of the forward exchange contracts at december   and comparing that with the value calculated using the hypothetical forward currency exchange rates
