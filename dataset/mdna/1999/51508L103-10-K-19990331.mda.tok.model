future increases in restaurant labor costs  land and construction costs could adversely affect the company s profitability and ability to expand 
year date conversion the company recognizes the need to insure that its operation will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive data by the company s computerized information systems 
in  the company began to evaluate  test and modify its computer information systems to ensure proper processing of transactions relating to the year and beyond 
since all of the company s critical business information systems are vendor supported software packages  this remediation process involves performing normal software version upgrades and some related hardware upgrades on those vendor supported systems that are not already year compliant 
the company expects to complete the required upgrades and modifications by august the amount charged to expense during the twelve months ended december   as well as the amounts anticipated to be charged to expense related to the year computer compliance modifications  have not been and are not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is taking steps to resolve year compliance issues that may be created by customers  suppliers and financial institutions with whom the company does business 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other entities will be converted on a timely basis 
the company believes that in an emergency it could revert to the use of manual systems that do not rely on computers and could perform the minimum functions required to provide information reporting to maintain satisfactory control of the business 
should the company have to utilize manual systems  it is uncertain that it could maintain the same level of operations  and this could have a material adverse impact on the business 
the company intends to maintain constant surveillance on this situation and will develop such contingency plans as are required by the changing environment
