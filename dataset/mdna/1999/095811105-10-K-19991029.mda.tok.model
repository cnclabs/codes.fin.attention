item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
overview blue rhino was founded in march and has become the leading national provider of grill cylinder exchange in the united states offering consumers a convenient means to obtain propane for their barbecue grills and other propane fueled appliances 
we originally focused on serving markets in the southeastern united states and have since developed a network of independent distributors which  as of july   serviced more than  blue rhino grill cylinder exchange locations in states and puerto rico 
during fiscal  our total revenues increased approximately to approximately million from the prior year s comparable period primarily as a result of the growth of sales at existing locations and the addition of over  new retail locations 
since formation  we have focused on creating an infrastructure to support our nationwide cylinder exchange program 
initially  we developed a vertically integrated operation  purchasing and leasing grill cylinders  cylinder displays  filling sites  refurbishing equipment and delivery vehicles while at the same time developing a sales  marketing and management information systems mis infrastructure 
in march  we began to transition from a vertically integrated business model to an independent distributor business model in order to accelerate the development and implementation of our cylinder exchange program in a more capital efficient manner 
at that time  we began to dispose of distribution assets and to enter into exclusive agreements with independent distributors to refurbish and refill cylinders and service our retail accounts 
we completed our transition to an independent distributor business model in the third quarter of fiscal although we incurred some expenses related to the prior business model in fiscal as of the end of fiscal seven of our distributors owed us  under five year notes receivable related to the sale of our assets to the distributors 
we believe that as a result of this transition  we have successfully accelerated the growth of our nationwide cylinder exchange service 
while we are committed to our independent distributor model  we recognize that our rapid and substantial growth imposes significant capital demands on our distributors 
we believe that it is in our best interest to facilitate the business development of our distributors 
accordingly  we sought to establish a financing facility which would enable our distributors to acquire cylinders sufficient to service our rapid growth 
in october  four individuals associated with us as directors  officers and or stockholders formed usa leasing  llc usa leasing to provide the necessary cylinder lease financing to our distributors 
usa leasing used debt financing to purchase cylinders that it leased to blue rhino distributors 
on july   we acquired of the membership interests of usa leasing 
as the sole consideration for the purchase  we increased our guarantee of usa leasing s debt from to 
usa leasing s financial information has been consolidated with blue rhino as a result of the common ownership and control of usa leasing and blue rhino and our guarantee of their credit facility 
to better position our company for future growth  in february we purchased approximately acres in hamptonville  north carolina to develop and construct an automated propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant 
this facility will employ new filling and refurbishing technologies to improve processing efficiency and enhance product quality 
as of july   we had invested approximately million in the land and the initial stages of construction of this automated propane bottling and in february refurbishing plant 
we expect to complete this plant in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal with an aggregate investment of approximately million 
on october   we entered into a letter of intent with manchester tank and equipment company manchester to establish a joint venture to develop  own and operate this plant 
under this arrangement blue rhino and manchester are expected to share the cost to develop the plant 
we currently offer three types of grill cylinder transactions i like for like cylinder exchanges  ii cylinder exchanges with valve upgrades offering additional safety features  and iii filled cylinder sales 
our net sales from cylinder exchanges  cylinder upgrades and cylinder sales comprised approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales for fiscal in addition to grill cylinder transactions  our revenues consist of product sales principally from patio heaters and lease income on cylinders and cylinder displays leased to our distributors 
we recognize revenues on patio heaters which are sold to distributors and to retailers at the time of shipment 
we derive our lease income primarily from monthly rental amounts based on of the original fair market value of the cylinders and cylinder displays 
other factors which influence our revenues include seasonality  consumer awareness  weather conditions  new grill sales  alternative uses for grill cylinders  promotional activities and advertising 
our cost of sales is primarily comprised of a contractually determined fixed charge which we pay to distributors based upon the type of cylinder transaction  the cost of patio heaters and a non cash charge associated with options granted under our distributor stock option plan distributor option plan 
based upon prior grants of options under the distributor option plan  we estimate that we will incur annual non cash charges of approximately  through fiscal related to these prior grants 
in fiscal  the related charge was approximately  while we believe that we have created the infrastructure necessary to support a nationwide cylinder exchange program  development of this infrastructure has resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of july  this has resulted in net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes which we can use to offset future taxable income  if any 
based on our history of operating losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance to the full extent of our net deferred tax assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of certain items from our statements of operations to total revenues 
due to the change in our business model and our rapid sales growth  any trends reflected by the following table may not be indicative of future results 
july  july  july  total revenues operating costs and expenses cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization nonrecurring items total operating costs and expenses income loss from operations other expense income interest expense loss on investee follow on offering other  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss as a percentage of total revenues net sales distributors net sales direct gross margin gross margin of net sales distributors gross margin of net sales direct comparison of years ended july  and total revenues 
total revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal the total revenues of million for fiscal consisted of approximately million from cylinder transactions  million from product sales combined cylinder transactions and product sales are reflected on the statement of operations as net sales distributors and million from lease income 
product sales  substantially all of which were made to our distributors  consist of patio heaters and cylinders 
lease income relates primarily to cylinders and cylinder displays leased to our distributors 
the increase in total revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of retail locations placed in service and increased sales volume at existing locations 
the increase in lease income was due primarily to the growth in the number of cylinder displays placed in service and to the leasing of cylinders to distributors under operating leases which commenced in fiscal the number of cylinders transacted increased to approximately million units during fiscal from approximately million units during fiscal gross margin 
gross margin increased to approximately for fiscal from approximately for fiscal the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased lease income which is not offset by cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal but decreased as a percentage of total revenues to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to additional compensation costs stemming primarily from the growth of our internal sales force  costs related to introducing our endless summer patio heater product and additional costs associated with operating a public company including investor relations and other professional fees 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues was due primarily to the fact that a significant portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed and  as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses increased at a slower rate than total revenues 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal depreciation expense increased by million to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal primarily due to the increase in the number of cylinder displays and the commencement of depreciation on cylinders held under operating lease agreements 
the increase in cylinder displays was due to our purchase of approximately million of cylinder displays in may which we previously leased under an operating lease and our ongoing purchase of additional cylinders and cylinder displays to support growth in our installed base of retail locations 
our purchase of computer technology also impacted depreciation expense to a lesser extent 
amortization expense increased by  to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal principally due to the increased amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of propane cylinder exchange locations

there were no nonrecurring charges in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense decreased to approximately  for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense resulted from the repayment of substantially all of our outstanding indebtedness in may with proceeds from our initial public offering 
the interest expense for fiscal is a result of borrowings under our credit facility and usa leasing s credit facility and capital lease obligations incurred primarily to acquire computer technology 
follow on offering 
for fiscal  we incurred a one time charge of approximately  for expenses incurred in connection with an offering of common stock which we terminated in february due to unfavorable market conditions 
loss on investee 
loss on investee decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  which reflects the application of the equity method of accounting to our convertible loan to bison valve  llc bison valve 
we recorded these losses as bison valve used the proceeds of our loan to fund losses incurred primarily in researching  developing  marketing and producing an overfill prevention device opd and other propane related products 
as of october   we had recognized charges for the entire principal balance of our convertible loan 
in september  we purchased from bison valve the intellectual property  inventory and certain other assets related to its underwriters laboratories approved opd 
see subsequent events 
other  net 
other  net decreased to approximately  for the fiscal year ended july  from approximately  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the loss on disposal of property and equipment of approximately  recorded in fiscal which was offset by increased interest income from excess cash balances and various notes receivable

comparison of years ended july  and total revenues 
total revenues consist of sales from our independent distributor network net sales distributors  sales from our previous vertically integrated distribution operations net sales direct  and to a lesser extent  from other revenues 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed our transition to our independent distributor business model and  as a result  all of our net sales during fiscal were net sales distributors 
other revenues consist of cylinder display lease income and lease income from certain plant facilities and equipment leased to our distributors 
total revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal from approximately million for fiscal net sales distributors increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal the increase in total revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of retail locations placed in service and the corresponding increase in the number of cylinder transactions during the period 
the installed base of retail locations increased to approximately  locations at the end of fiscal from approximately  locations at the end of fiscal the number of cylinder transactions increased to approximately million units in fiscal from approximately million units in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin  excluding the impact from other revenues  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was due to the shift from a vertically integrated business model to an independent distributor business model and the subsequent increase in net sales distributors and decrease in net sales direct 
with respect to net sales distributors  gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was due to a shift in the mix of cylinder transactions with lower margin cylinder sales accounting for a smaller percentage of net sales distributors in fiscal than in fiscal  as well as a price increase which became effective in april on all cylinder transactions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of total revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to additional commissions to outside brokers  which were based on a percentage of total revenues  additional compensation costs and increased cylinder display rent expense 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues was due primarily to the fact that a significant portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed and  as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses increased at a slower rate than total revenues

nonrecurring charges 
nonrecurring charges decreased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the nonrecurring charges were associated with our transition from a vertically integrated business model to an independent distributor business model and consisted primarily of the write down of facilities and equipment purchased to support the vertically integrated business model 
interest expense 
interest expense remained relatively constant at approximately million for fiscal and interest expense was attributed to accretion of interest on senior discount notes  additional borrowings under lines of credit and  to a lesser extent  borrowings from stockholders 
however  these debts were paid in full in may with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering  eliminating additional interest expense with respect to these obligations 
loss on investee 
loss on investee was  in fiscal which reflects the application of the equity method of accounting to our convertible loan to bison valve 
a loss was recorded because bison valve used the proceeds of our loan to fund losses incurred primarily in researching  developing  marketing and producing an opd and other propane related products 
other  net 
other  net increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal other  net consisted primarily of interest income from various notes receivable and excess cash balances

to better position our company for future growth  during fiscal we purchased approximately acres located in hamptonville  north carolina and began construction of an automated propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant 
this facility will employ new filling and refurbishing technologies to improve processing efficiency and enhance product quality 
as of july   we had invested approximately million into the land and the initial stages of construction of this plant which we expect to be complete in third or fourth quarter of fiscal with an aggregate investment of approximately million see subsequent events

the investors included the following officers and directors of the company messrs

prim  craig j 
duchossois  andrew j 
filipowski  mark castaneda  steven d 
devick  richard a 
brenner and jerald d 
shadley  who in the aggregate purchased  of the  units sold 
the price per unit was  which was the closing price of our common stock on september   the final trading day prior to the consummation of the offering 
the warrants may be exercised at a price equal to per share at any time prior to september  we used the aggregate proceeds of the two september offerings to pay certain expenses associated with the offerings  repay our primary cylinder vendor who financed our purchase of cylinders during fiscal  repay other indebtedness and acquire assets 
the balance will be used to acquire additional assets and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in october  we signed a letter of intent with manchester to establish a joint venture to develop  own and operate the automated propane bottling and cylinder refurbishing plant now under construction 
blue rhino and manchester expect to share in the cost of developing and constructing the plant 
we expect this joint venture to leverage the expertise of manchester and blue rhino and will be owned by both parties 
also in october  we agreed to acquire a cylinder exchange provider with approximately locations in tennessee  south carolina and georgia for approximately million in the aggregate related to assets including cylinders  cylinder displays and the right  title and interest in and to the seller s retail propane cylinder exchange accounts and locations 
seasonality we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our total revenues and net income loss 
our total revenues generally are highest in the third and fourth quarters  which include the majority of the grilling season  and historically have been lower in the first and second quarters which include the winter months 
sustained periods of poor weather  particularly in the spring and summer seasons  can negatively impact sales 
our rate of establishing new retail locations and expenses incurred in anticipation of increased sales also cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations 
accordingly  the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our total revenues or the results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
impact of new accounting pronouncements there were no items of comprehensive income for the fiscal years ended july   and  as defined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
was amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
 which delayed the effective date of implementation by one year 
we are required to and will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal we have not completed all of the analysis  but we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
year compliance year issues are the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other material adverse consequences  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities 
we depend on our management information systems mis to process orders  manage inventory and accounts receivable  maintain distributor and customer information  assist distributors in delivering products on a timely basis and in maintaining cost efficient operations 
our state of readiness for year we began evaluating our mis for year compliance in january since that time we have developed a year compliance policy encompassing employee education  testing  progress reporting  external impact plans and contingency plans 
our chief information officer directs our year compliance policy and oversees the remediation and testing of mis 
as of july   we believe we are year compliant 
all core mis programs are currently year compliant 
however  if our modifications  testing and solicitations of third party compliance are not made on a timely basis or do not resolve our year issues  these issues could have a negative effect on our business 
we have assessed the year readiness of each of our core mis and remediated these systems as necessary 
our core mis include online sales account information system oasis  platinum for windows  electronic data interchange edi and blue rhino electronic accounting system breas 
oasis was already compliant when it was implemented in february  platinum for windows was updated in march to be year compliant  edi was upgraded in december to be year compliant and breas was upgraded in october to be year compliant 
we have engaged integrated solutions international  llc to  among other things  assist us in implementing our distributors use of year compliant handheld computer units of breas 
all of our distributors are currently using year compliant handheld units 
we have established integrated test procedures in which all of our mis are continuously tested for year compliance 
historical and estimated costs 
we have not established a separate year compliance budget and do not expect to do so 
to date  we have incurred approximately  in year compliance costs 
we currently anticipate that the implementation of our year compliance policy will cost approximately  all of which will be expensed 
although we can give no assurances  we do not expect future costs related to year compliance to negatively affect our business in any material way 
costs are based on current estimates and actual results may vary significantly from such estimates 
most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario we face is an interruption of our business operations caused by the failure of third parties with which we have a material relationship to achieve year compliance 
the consequences of a third party failure are unknown  but could have a negative effect on our business 
we are considering several contingency plans to address possible business interruptions caused by a non compliant third party 
possible contingency plans include using alternate service providers and using a manual billing  payment and collection system 
initial contingency plans have been completed 
additional refinement and monitoring will continue throughout the remainder of calendar in addition  in an effort to protect ourselves and increase the awareness of third parties whose failure to comply could have a material effect on our business  we are seeking to obtain certifications from them that they are year compliant 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our borrowings under the usa leasing credit facility and our new bank credit facility 
the usa leasing credit facility and our new bank credit facility bear interest based on libor 
the usa leasing credit facility is collateralized by cylinders held under operating leases with our independent distributors 
the operating leases currently yield of the cylinder value monthly approximately annual and continue until either party terminates upon day written notice to the other party 
upon any significant increase in libor  we would attempt to renegotiate the operating leases with our independent distributors mitigating the interest rate exposure on the majority of the notes payable to the bank 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such renegotiations or that we will be able to mitigate any or all of the interest rate risk 
we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents and investments in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of money market instruments  bank certificates of deposit and overnight investments in commercial paper 
all of our transactions are conducted and accounts are denominated in united states dollars and as such we do not currently have exposure to foreign currency risk 
furthermore  we do not have any direct exposure to commodity price risk
