item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview amtran is a leading provider of targeted scheduled airline services and charter airline services to leisure and other value oriented travelers 
amtran  through its principal subsidiary  ata  has been operating for years and is the eleventh largest us airline in terms of revenues 
ata provides scheduled service through nonstop and connecting flights from the gateways of chicago midway and indianapolis to popular vacation destinations such as hawaii  las vegas  florida  california  mexico and the caribbean  as well as to denver  dallas ft 
worth and new york city s laguardia and john f 
kennedy airports 
ata also provides charter service throughout the world to independent tour operators  specialty charter customers and the us military 
in  the company generated record operating earnings and net income as compared to any previous fiscal year in the company s year history 
these results were primarily due to the effects of record operating revenues  unchanged unit operating expenses and higher utilization of aircraft 
was a year of recovery for the company  after a substantial net loss in extensive business unit profitability analysis in late prompted the company to undertake significant restructuring of scheduled service operations and standardization of the boeing fleet 
as a result of these efforts  the company finished with net income  a substantial improvement over results of operations in  the company earned million in operating income and million in net income  as compared to operating and net income of million and million  respectively  in and an operating and net loss of million and million  respectively in operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in operating expense per asm remained unchanged at cents in both years 
operating expenses were million in  which equated to cents per asm

b a departure is a single takeoff and landing operated by a single aircraft between an origin city and a destination city 
c block hours for any aircraft represent the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power from the origin city boarding ramp to the moment it comes to rest at the destination city boarding ramp 
d revenue passenger miles rpms represent the number of seats occupied by revenue passengers multiplied by the number of miles those seats are flown 
rpms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity actually sold by the company 
e available seat miles asms represent the number of seats available for sale to revenue passengers multiplied by the number of miles those seats are flown 
asms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity offered for sale by the company  whether sold or not 
f passenger load factor is the percentage derived by dividing rpms by asms 
passenger load factor is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because incremental passengers normally provide incremental revenue and profitability when seats are sold individually 
in the case of commercial charter and military government charter  load factor is less relevant because an entire aircraft is sold by the company instead of individual seats 
since both costs and revenues are largely fixed for these types of charter flights  changes in load factor have less impact on business unit profitability 
consolidated load factors and scheduled service load factors for the company are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but load factors for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
g passengers enplaned are the number of revenue passengers who occupied seats on the company s flights 
this measure is also referred to as passengers boarded 
h revenue per asm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as rasm 
rasm measures the company s unit revenue using total available seat capacity 
in the case of scheduled service  rasm is a measure of the combined impact of load factor and yield see j below for the definition of yield 
i cost per asm expressed in cents is total operating expense divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as casm 
casm measures the company s unit cost using total available seat capacity 
j revenue per rpm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total rpms 
this measure is also referred to as yield 
yield is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because yield is a measure of the average price paid by customers purchasing individual seats 
yield is less relevant to the commercial charter and military government charter businesses because the entire aircraft is sold at one time for one price 
consolidated yields and scheduled service yields are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but yields for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
operating revenues total operating revenues in increased to million from million in this increase was due to a million increase in scheduled service revenues  a million increase in other revenues and a million increase in ground package revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in commercial charter revenues  and a million decrease in military government charter revenues 
scheduled service revenues 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the scheduled service operations of the company 
data shown for jet operations include the combined operations of lockheed l  boeing and boeing aircraft in scheduled service 
data shown for j operations include the operations of jetstream propeller aircraft operated on the company s behalf by chicago express as the ata connection

revenue per segment is a broad measure of the average price obtained for all flight segments flown by passengers in the company s scheduled service route network 
scheduled service revenues in increased to million from million in scheduled service revenues comprised of consolidated revenues in  as compared to of consolidated revenues in the company currently has a code share agreement with chicago express under which chicago express operates seat jetstream propeller aircraft as the ata connection between chicago midway and the cities of indianapolis  milwaukee  des moines  dayton  grand rapids  lansing and madison 
the period to period percentage changes in departures  block hours and passengers boarded were significantly impacted by the operation of ata connection jetstream commuter flights in the twelve months ended december   which operated only during the nine months ended december  such operations in all periods generate comparatively less impact to asms and rpms due to the small seat capacity and short stage length of ata connection propeller aircraft as compared to the company s jet aircraft 
in february  the company entered into an agreement in principle to acquire chicago express airlines  inc  ata s code sharing partner at chicago midway 
the company s scheduled service at chicago midway accounted for approximately of scheduled service asms and of scheduled service departures  as compared to and  respectively  in on may   the company began three daily nonstop flights to dallas ft 
worth and two daily nonstop flights to denver  none of which services were provided during in addition to these new services  the company added frequencies in to most existing jet markets  including ft 
lauderdale  ft 
myers  las vegas  los angeles  orlando  phoenix  st 
petersburg and san francisco 
flight frequencies to sarasota declined between periods 
ata connection jetstream flights in and the nine months ended december  served chicago midway from the cities of dayton  des moines  grand rapids  indianapolis and milwaukee 
in addition  the company operated ata connection jetstream service between chicago midway and the cities of lansing and madison throughout  while such service was operated only during the fourth quarter of the company anticipates that its chicago midway operation will represent a focus of growing significance for its scheduled service business in and beyond 
the company operated daily jet and commuter departures from chicago midway and served destinations on a nonstop basis in the summer of  as compared to nonstop destinations served in the summer of by the end of  the company completed a million renovation of the existing terminal facilities at chicago midway to enhance their attractiveness and convenience for the company s customers 
the company also presently expects to occupy jet gates and six commuter aircraft gates at the new chicago midway terminal which is presently scheduled for completion in  as compared to the six jet gates currently occupied in the existing terminal 
the company s growing commitment to chicago midway is consistent with its strategy for enhancing revenues and profitability in scheduled service by focusing primarily on low cost  nonstop flights from airports where it has market or aircraft advantages in addition to its low cost 
the company expects its growing concentration of connecting flights at chicago midway to provide both revenue premiums and operating cost efficiencies  as compared to the company s other gateway cities 
the company s hawaii service accounted for of scheduled service asms and of scheduled service departures in  as compared to and  respectively  in the company provided nonstop services in both years from los angeles  phoenix and san francisco to both honolulu and maui  with connecting service between honolulu and maui 
in addition  in  seasonal nonstop service was operated from san diego to honolulu  which was not operated in the company provides these services through a marketing alliance with the largest independent tour operator serving leisure travelers to hawaii from the united states 
the company distributes the remaining seats on these flights through normal scheduled service distribution channels 
the company believes it has superior operating efficiencies in west coast hawaii markets due to the relatively low ownership cost of the lockheed l fleet and because of the high daily hours of utilization obtained for both aircraft and crews 
the company s indianapolis service accounted for of scheduled service asms and of scheduled service departures in  as compared to and  respectively  in in  the company operated nonstop to cancun  ft 
lauderdale  ft 
myers  las vegas  los angeles  orlando  st 
petersburg  san francisco and sarasota 
the company has served indianapolis for years through the ambassadair travel club and in scheduled service since the company continues to evaluate the profitability of its scheduled service markets and expects to adjust its service from time to time 
the company believes that scheduled service yields and load factors in have benefited from strong customer demand for air transportation in the united states during a period of constrained industry growth in seat capacity relative to this demand 
the ability of the company to increase its year over year scheduled service seat capacity by  and to operate with a higher load factor between years  further underscores the fundamental strength of current demand in its domestic scheduled service 
commercial charter revenues 
the company s commercial charter revenues are derived principally from independent tour operators and specialty charter customers 
the company s commercial charter product provides full service air transportation to hundreds of customer designated destinations throughout the world 
commercial charter revenue growth in was constrained by the reassignment of several narrow body aircraft to scheduled service expansion and by subservice contracts with other airlines  which the company believes have been more profitable for these aircraft than the commercial charter applications they replaced 
the company  however  continues to believe that tour operator and specialty charter are businesses where the company s experience and size provide meaningful competitive advantage and are businesses to which the company remains committed 
commercial charter revenues accounted for of consolidated revenues in  as compared to in the company is addressing its seat capacity limitations in the commercial and military government charter business units through the acquisition of long range lockheed l series aircraft 
in july  the company committed to the purchase of five such aircraft for delivery between the third quarter of and the second quarter of although lockheed l series maintenance procedures and cockpit design are similar to the company s existing fleet of lockheed l series and series aircraft  they differ operationally in that their ten to eleven hour range permits them to operate nonstop to parts of asia  south america and central and eastern europe using an all coach seating configuration preferred by the us military and most of the company s commercial charter customers 
the company expects to place these aircraft into service in commercial and military government charter operations during  which will increase the available seat capacity for these charter business units  in addition to opening new long range market opportunities to the company which it cannot serve with its existing fleet 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the commercial charter operations of the company 
twelve months ended december  inc dec inc dec departures b   block hours c    rpms s d    asms s e    passengers enplaned g    revenue s    rasm in cents h see footnotes b through h on pages and the company operates in two principal components of the commercial charter business  known as track charter and specialty charter 
the larger track charter business component is generally comprised of low frequency but repetitive domestic and international flights between city pairs  which support high passenger load factors and are marketed through tour operators  providing value priced and convenient nonstop service to vacation destinations for the leisure traveler 
since track charter resembles scheduled service in terms of its repetitive flying patterns between fixed city pairs  it allows the company to achieve reasonable levels of crew and aircraft utilization although less than for scheduled service  and provides the company with meaningful protection from some fuel price increases through the use of fuel escalation reimbursement clauses in tour operator contracts 
track charter accounted for approximately million in revenues in  as compared to million in specialty charter including incentive travel programs is a product which is designed to meet the unique requirements of the customer and is a business characterized by lower frequency of operation and by greater variation in city pairs served than the track charter business 
specialty charter includes such diverse contracts as flying university alumni to football games  transporting political candidates on campaign trips and moving nasa space shuttle ground crews to alternate landing sites 
the company also operates an increasing number of trips in all first class configuration for certain corporate and high end leisure clients 
although lower utilization of crews and aircraft and infrequent service to specialty destinations often result in higher average operating costs  the company has determined that the revenue premium earned by meeting special customer requirements more than compensates for these increased costs 
the diversity of the company s three fleet types also permits the company to meet a customer s particular needs by choosing the aircraft type which provides the most economical solution for those requirements 
specialty charter accounted for approximately million in revenues in  as compared to million in militarylgovernment charter revenues 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the military government flight operations of the company 
twelve months ended december  inc dec inc dec departures b   block hours c    rpms s d    asms s e    passengers enplaned g    revenue s    rasm in cents h see footnotes b through h on pages and the company participates in two related military government charter programs known as fixed award and short term expansion 
pursuant to the us military s fixed award system  each participating airline is awarded certain mobilization value points based upon the number and type of aircraft made available by that airline for military flying 
in order to increase the number of points awarded  the company has entered into a contractor teaming arrangement with four other cargo airlines 
under this arrangement  the team has a greater likelihood of receiving fixed award business and  to the extent that the award includes passenger transport  the opportunity for the company to operate this flying is enhanced since the company represents all of the passenger transport capacity of the team 
as part of its participation in this teaming arrangement  the company pays a commission to the team  which passes that revenue on to all team members based upon their mobilization points 
all airlines participating in the fixed award business contract annually with the us military from october to the following september for each contract year  reimbursement rates are determined for aircraft types and mission categories based upon operating cost data submitted by the participating airlines 
these contracts are generally not subject to renegotiation once they become effective 
short term expansion business is awarded by the us military first on a pro rata basis to those carriers who have been provided fixed award business and then to any other carrier with aircraft availability 
expansion flying is generally offered to airlines on very short notice 
the overall amount of military flying that the company performs in any one year is dependent upon several factors  including i the percentage of mobilization value points represented by the company s team as compared to total mobilization value points of all providers of military service  ii the percentage of passenger capacity of the company with respect to its own team  iii the amount of fixed award and expansion flying required by the us military in each contract year  and iv the availability of the company s aircraft to accept and fly expansion awards 
ground package revenues 
the company earns ground package revenues through the sale of hotel  car rental and cruise accommodations in conjunction with the company s air transportation product 
the company markets these ground packages to its ambassadair club members and through its ata vacations subsidiary to its scheduled service passengers 
in  ground package revenues increased to million  as compared to million in the company s ambassadair travel club offers hundreds of tour guide accompanied vacation packages to its approximately  individual and family members annually 
in  total packages sold decreased as compared to  but the average revenue earned for each ground package sold increased between periods 
ata vacations offers numerous ground accommodations to the general public for use with the company s scheduled service flights in many areas of the united states 
these packages are marketed through travel agents  as well as directly by the company 
in  total packages sold decreased as compared to  while the average revenue earned for each ground package sold decreased between years 
the number of ground packages sold and the average revenue earned by the company for a ground package sale are a function of the mix of vacation destinations served  the quality and types of ground accommodations offered and general competitive conditions with other air carriers offering similar products in the company s markets  all of which are factors that can change from period to period 
in early  the company completed the purchase of travel charter international  a tour operator  and has an agreement in principle to acquire another tour operator  key travel 
other revenues 
other revenues are comprised of the consolidated revenues of affiliated companies  together with miscellaneous categories of revenue associated with the scheduled and charter operations of the company 
other revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in in  as compared to  the company earned million more in substitute service revenues  million more in cancellation and administrative fees  and million more in cargo and other affiliate company revenues  partially offset by million less revenue earned from the sale of surplus and obsolete aircraft parts 
a substitute service agreement typically provides for the company to operate aircraft with its crews on routes designated by the customer airline to carry the passengers of that airline for a limited period of time 
the company has seen increased demand for this type of service in due to delays in new aircraft deliveries being experienced by various airlines 
the company also increased its administrative fee for change of reservation on non refundable scheduled service tickets from to per change effective august  and the volume of such fees earned also increased between years in proportion to the increase in scheduled service passengers boarded 
operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include the cost of salaries and wages paid to the company s employees  together with the company s cost of employee benefits and payroll related local  state and federal taxes 
salaries  wages and benefits expense in increased to million from million in the company increased its average equivalent employees by between and in order to appropriately staff the growth in available seats offered between periods 
categories of employees where this growth was most significant included cockpit and cabin crews  reservations agents  airport passenger and ramp service agents  and aircraft maintenance personnel  all of which are influenced directly by flight activity 
some employment growth in was also needed to correct for certain employee shortages in  particularly in the areas of cockpit crews  reservations agents and airframe and power plant mechanics 
the average rate of pay earned by the company s employees including all categories of salaries  wages and benefits  except for variable compensation was unchanged between and while most employees received wage rate increases between years  new employees are generally hired at lower average starting rates of pay than those rates in effect for more senior employees 
the increase in new employees between periods approximately offset the wage rate increases applicable to more senior employees 
in  the company recorded million in variable compensation and related payroll taxes as a result of the significant improvement in earnings as compared to  when no such compensation was incurred 
in the second quarter of  a one time charge of million was recorded for variable compensation expense associated with the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer 
salaries  wages and benefits cost per asm increased in to cents  as compared to cents in this unit cost increase was attributable to the faster rate of growth in average equivalent employees between years than seat capacity  and to the variable compensation earned in  which was not earned in fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in this decrease occurred despite the company consuming more gallons of jet fuel for flying operations between years  which resulted in an increase in fuel expense of approximately million 
jet fuel consumption increased primarily due to the increased number of block hours of jet flying operations between periods 
the company flew  jet block hours in  as compared to  jet block hours in  an increase of between years 
fuel consumption growth between and was less than total block hour growth  however  since most of the block hour growth in was in the narrow body boeing and boeing fleets  which consume approximately of the gallons per block hour which are consumed by the lockheed l fleet 
during  the company s average cost per gallon of jet fuel consumed decreased by as compared to  resulting in a decrease in fuel and oil expense of approximately million between years 
this reduction in fuel price was experienced generally in the airline industry throughout as a result of significant reductions in average crude oil and distillate market prices as compared to during the first  second and fourth quarters of  the company entered into several fuel price hedge contracts under which the company sought to reduce the risk of fuel price increases during the year 
the company hedged some fuel consumption under swap agreements which established specific swap prices for designated periods  and hedged other fuel consumption under fuel cap agreements which guaranteed a maximum price per gallon for designated periods 
since the price of fuel declined during most of  the company recorded approximately million in additional fuel and oil expense under its hedge contracts  which added approximately one cent to its average cost per gallon in fuel and oil expense decreased to cents per asm in  as compared to cents per asm in  primarily due to the period to period decrease in the average price of fuel consumed 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation reflects the periodic expensing of the recorded cost of owned airframes and engines  leasehold improvements and rotable parts for all fleet types  together with other property and equipment owned by the company 
amortization is primarily the periodic expensing of capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all fleet types on a units of production basis using aircraft flight hours and cycles landings as the units of measure 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in  as compared to million in depreciation expense attributable to owned airframes and leasehold improvements increased million in  as compared to the company purchased one boeing and one boeing aircraft in late which had been previously financed through operating leases  thereby increasing depreciation expense on airframes between years 
the company recorded a reduction in aircraft rental expense between periods for the termination of operating leases for these aircraft  which is further described below under aircraft rentals 
the company also recorded additional inventory obsolescence expense for certain aircraft parts held for sale which were sold during the first quarter of  and increased its investment in rotable parts and computer hardware and software  among other items of property and equipment 
these changes resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of million in  as compared to amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls increased million in  as compared to  after including the offsetting amortization associated with manufacturers credits 
changes to the cost of overhaul amortization were partly due to the increase in total block hours and cycles flown between comparable periods for the boeing and lockheed l fleets  since such expense varies with that activity  and partly due to the completion of more engine and airframe overhauls between periods for these fleet types 
rolls royce powered boeing aircraft  seven of which were delivered new from the manufacturer between late and late  are not presently generating any engine or airframe overhaul expense  since the initial post delivery overhauls for these aircraft are not yet due under the company s maintenance programs 
the cost of engine overhauls that become worthless due to early engine failures and which cannot be economically repaired is charged to depreciation and amortization expense in the period the engine fails 
depreciation and amortization expense attributable to these write offs increased million in as compared to when these early engine failures can be economically repaired  the related repairs are charged to aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense 
effective july   the company extended the estimated useful life of the owned lockheed l series and series aircraft to a common retirement date of december  and also reduced the estimated salvage value of the related airframes  engines and rotables 
the effect of this change in estimate was to reduce depreciation expense in by million 
depreciation and amortization expense per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in this increase was primarily due to the increased amount of overhaul cost incurred to maintain the company s boeing and lockheed l airframes and engines 
airframes and engines which originally enter the company s fleet from time to time often do not require such overhauls until several years later 
therefore  units added to the company s fleet over the last several years are currently scheduled for or are undergoing overhaul 
such overhaul expense incurred and to be incurred is incremental in comparison to prior periods 
although the company s fleet of new boeing aircraft has not yet begun this initial overhaul cycle  the company anticipates that it will do so beginning in  at which time increased overhaul amortization expense per asm will be incurred for this fleet type as well 
handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling and landing fees include the costs incurred by the company at airports to land and service its aircraft and to handle passenger check in  security and baggage where the company elects to use third party contract services in lieu of its own employees 
where the company uses its own employees to perform ground handling functions  the resulting cost appears within salaries  wages and benefits 
air navigation fees are incurred when the company s aircraft fly over certain foreign airspace 
handling  landing and navigation fees increased by to million in  as compared to million in the total number of system wide jet departures between and increased by to  from  resulting in approximately million in volume related handling and landing expense increases between periods 
this volume related increase was partially offset  however  by a decrease of approximately million in price and mix related handling and landing expenses for  as compared to  attributable primarily to a change in jet departure mix 
the cost per asm for handling  landing and navigation fees decreased to cents in  from cents in aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
this expense includes the cost of expendable aircraft spare parts  repairs to repairable and rotable aircraft components  contract labor for light airframe check and line maintenance activities  and other non capitalized direct costs related to fleet maintenance  including spare engine leases  parts loan and exchange fees  and related shipping costs 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company performed a total of light airframe checks on its fleet during  as compared to such checks performed in  an increase of between years 
the cost of materials consumed and components repaired in association with such light checks and other maintenance activity increased by million between and the cost per asm of aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals expense for decreased to million from million in the company purchased one leased boeing in september  returned one leased boeing to the lessor in november of  and added one new leased boeing each in december and august these fleet changes resulted in a reduction in boeing rentals expense of million in  as compared to aircraft rentals expense for the boeing and lockheed l fleets did not change significantly between years 
aircraft rentals cost per asm for was cents  a decrease of from cents per asm in such reduction in cost per asm was primarily attributable to the increased utilization of all aircraft types between years  producing more asms with approximately the same fleet size 
crew and other employee travel 
crew and other employee travel is primarily the cost of air transportation  hotels and per diem reimbursements to cockpit and cabin crew members incurred to position crews away from their bases to operate company flights throughout the world 
the cost of air transportation is generally more significant for the commercial and military government charter business units since these flights often operate between cities in which company crews are not normally based and may involve extensive international positioning of crews 
hotel and per diem expenses are incurred for scheduled  commercial and military government charter services  although higher per diem and hotel rates generally apply to international assignments 
the cost of crew and other employee travel increased to million in  as compared to million in during  the company s average full time equivalent cockpit and cabin crew employment was higher than in  while jet block hours flown increased by between the same periods 
the average cost of hotel rooms per full time equivalent crew member increased in  as compared to such hotel costs increased due to both higher room rates paid in  and due to aircraft flow changes associated with the company s summer schedule which resulted in more crews terminating their daily flying away from their home bases than in the prior year 
the average cost of crew positioning per full time equivalent crew member decreased in  as compared to crew positioning costs declined primarily due to the shift of revenue production from commercial charter and military government charter to scheduled service 
crews positioning out of base for scheduled service can often position at no cost on company flights  whereas positioning to remote international locations for charter service is usually done on other carriers at an incremental cost 
the cost per asm for crew and other employee travel increased to cents in  as compared to cents in passenger service 
passenger service expense includes the onboard costs of meal and non alcoholic beverage catering  the cost of alcoholic beverages and in flight movie headsets sold  and the cost of onboard entertainment programs  together with certain costs incurred for mishandled baggage and passengers inconvenienced due to flight delays or cancellations 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the total cost of passenger service increased to million in  as compared to million in the company experienced a decrease of approximately in the average unit cost of catering each passenger between years  primarily because in there were relatively more scheduled service passengers in the company s business mix  who are provided a less expensive catering product than the company s longer stage length commercial and military government charter passengers 
this resulted in a price and business mix reduction of million in catering expense in  as compared to total jet passengers boarded  however  increased between years  resulting in approximately million in higher volume related catering expenses between the same sets of comparative periods 
the cost per asm of passenger service declined to cents in from cents in commissions 
the company incurs commissions expense in association with the sale by travel agents of single seats on scheduled service 
in addition  the company incurs commissions to secure some commercial and military government charter business 
commissions expense increased to million in  as compared to million in scheduled service commissions expense increased by million between and this increase was lower than the related increase of in scheduled service revenues between the same periods  partially because of an industry wide reduction in the standard travel agency commission rate from to which became effective in october  and partially due to relatively more non commissionable bulk seat scheduled service sales being made in  as compared to neither commercial charter nor military government charter commissions expense changed significantly between and the cost per asm of commissions expense was unchanged at cents for both and other selling expenses 
other selling expenses are comprised of i booking fees paid to computer reservation systems crs to reserve single seat sales for scheduled service  ii credit card discount expenses incurred when selling single seats and ground packages to customers using credit cards for payment  iii costs of providing toll free telephone service  primarily to single seat and vacation package customers who contact the company directly to book reservations  and iv miscellaneous other selling expenses primarily associated with single seat sales 
other selling expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in scheduled service passengers boarded increased between the same periods 
crs fees increased million in  as compared to  due to a increase in total crs bookings made for the expanded scheduled service business unit between periods  and due to a increase in the average cost of each crs booking 
toll free telephone costs increased million between and  primarily due to higher toll free usage related to higher scheduled service reservations activity 
credit card discount expense increased million in as compared to  due to higher earned revenues in scheduled service which were sold using credit cards as payment 
other selling cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in ground package cost 
ground package cost is incurred by the company with hotels  car rental companies  cruise lines and similar vendors who provide ground and cruise accommodations to ambassadair and ata vacations customers 
ground package cost increased to million in  as compared to million in the number of ambassadair ground packages sold in decreased  as compared to  while the average cost of ambassadair ground packages sold increased by between years 
the number of ata vacations ground packages sold in decreased as compared to  while the average cost of ata vacations ground packages sold decreased by between the same periods 
the cost per asm of ground packages decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company incurs advertising costs primarily to support single seat scheduled service sales and the sale of air and ground packages 
advertising support for these lines of businesses was increased in  consistent with the company s overall strategy to enhance scheduled service rasm through increases in load factor and yield 
the increase in total advertising expense between years was slightly greater than the increase in scheduled service revenues between the same periods 
the majority of the company s growth in was from increased frequencies at existing gateway cities such as chicago midway  which provided some advertising efficiencies in as compared to the prior year 
such market related efficiency was partially offset  however  due to temporarily higher advertising support required in the second and third quarters of for the introduction of the company s new services to dallas ft 
worth  denver  san juan  and new york s laguardia airport  as well as to launch the company s fall promotions in the third and fourth quarters of the cost per asm of advertising increased to cents in  as compared to cents in facilities and other rentals 
facilities and other rentals include the cost of all ground facilities that are leased by the company such as airport space  regional sales offices and general offices 
the cost of facilities and other rentals increased to million in  as compared to million in the rate of growth in facilities costs between periods was comparable to the rate of asm growth between and  due to the addition of new facilities for services to denver  dallas ft 
worth and new york s laguardia airport between periods 
the cost per asm for facility and other rentals was unchanged at cents in both and other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in other operating expenses which experienced significant changes between periods included i million of additional costs for the chicago express jetstream code share agreement  which agreement was not in effect in the first quarter  and because such code share was expanded to include lansing and madison in  which were served in only the fourth quarter of  ii million in higher expenses associated with the operation of the company s affiliate business  and iii million in higher costs associated with the short term leasing of substitute aircraft  and the reprotection of some of the company s passengers on other airlines  due to higher than normal delayed and irregular flight operations  primarily in the second quarter of other operating cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in interest income and expense 
interest expense in increased to million as compared to million in the increase in interest expense between periods was primarily due to changes in the company s capital structure resulting from the two financings completed on july   at which time the company i sold million principal amount of unsecured seven year notes  and ii entered into a new million secured revolving credit facility  thereby replacing the former secured revolving credit facility of million as of june  additionally  in december  the company sold million principal amount of unsecured senior notes 
prior to completing these new financings  the company utilized secured bank credit facilities to finance cash flow requirements of the company as they arose  thereby minimizing the level of borrowings on which interest would be paid 
during  the company s weighted average debt outstanding was approximately million  as compared to million in the weighted average effective interest rate applicable to the company s outstanding debt in was  as compared to in the increase in the weighted average effective interest rates between years was primarily due to the interest rate applicable to the million in unsecured notes issued on july   which was higher than the average interest rate which was applicable to borrowings under the former credit facility 
the company invested excess cash balances in short term government securities and commercial paper and thereby earned million in interest income in  as compared to million in income tax expense 
in the company recorded million in income tax expense applicable to million of pre tax income for that period  while in income tax expense was million on pre tax income of million 
the effective tax rate applicable to was  as compared to in income tax expense in both sets of comparative periods was affected by the permanent non deductibility for federal income tax purposes of a percentage of amounts paid for crew per diem in and in 
the effect of this and other permanent differences on the effective income tax rate for financial accounting purposes becomes more pronounced in cases where before tax income approaches zero  which was a significant reason for the higher effective tax rate in income tax expense for was also significantly affected by the one time million charge to salaries  wages and benefits for the executive compensation package provided to the company s former president and chief executive officer 
of the total compensation paid to this former executive of the company in  approximately million was non deductible against the company s federal taxable income

new seasonal scheduled service was also introduced in the second and third quarters of from new york to shannon and dublin  ireland  and belfast  northern ireland  and from the midwest to seattle 
new year round service also commenced to san diego  california  in the second quarter of the introduction of this new capacity coincided closely  however  with the may   valujet accident in florida  and the resulting persistent negative media attention directed toward airline safety  especially toward low fare airlines 
on may  the company experienced a cabin decompression incident on one of its own flights which  although it resulted in no serious injury to crew or passengers  nevertheless attracted additional negative media attention occurring as it did one day after the valujet tragedy 
as a consequence  during the second and third quarters of  the company estimates that it lost significant scheduled service revenues from both canceled reservations and reservations which were never received 
an analysis by the company in the third quarter of of the profitability of its scheduled service and commercial and military charter service business units disclosed that a number of scheduled service markets then being served by the company had become unprofitable at that point in time 
as a result of this analysis  in august the company announced a significant restructuring of scheduled service operations 
the company eliminated its boston and intra florida scheduled service operations and also exited  or reduced in frequency  certain markets served from chicago midway  indianapolis and milwaukee 
in conjunction with this restructuring  the company completed a reduction in its employee and contract work forces by the end of in addition  the company re evaluated the relative economic performance of its three aircraft fleet types in the context of the restructured markets to be served by the company and optimized the type and number of aircraft through a fleet restructuring which was completed by the end of the company reduced the number of boeing aircraft from units at the end of to seven units at the end of the remaining seven boeing aircraft were all powered by rolls royce engines 
the company committed the seven boeing s to mission specific uses in the us military and scheduled service business units 
after the restructuring  the company s core jet scheduled service included flights between chicago midway and five florida cities  las vegas  phoenix  los angeles and san francisco  indianapolis to four florida cities  las vegas and cancun  milwaukee to three florida cities  hawaii service from san francisco  los angeles and phoenix  and service between orlando and san juan and nassau 
as a result of the restructuring  scheduled service profitability was substantially improved in as compared to profitability was enhanced through a combination of significantly higher load factors and yields between periods  even though total revenues in scheduled service declined between years 
the company believes that profitability was enhanced in this business unit through the selective elimination of flights which had previously produced below average load factors and yield  and that the elimination of intra florida flying in particular was a prominent factor in this improvement 
profitability was further enhanced in certain scheduled service markets through the reassignment of aircraft fleet types to provide better balance within markets between revenues  costs and aircraft operational capabilities 
scheduled service profitability improvement in was accomplished in spite of what would normally have been a demand dampening effect from the re introduction of the us departure and federal excise taxes on tickets on march   which had expired on january  in august  federal legislation was enacted which extends these taxes until the us departure tax for international destinations was increased from to per passenger  and a new us arrivals tax of per passenger was added for passengers arriving into the united states from international cities 
effective october   the new tax law also changed the method of computation of the federal excise tax from a standard of ticket sale value to a declining percentage of ticket sale value ranging from to  plus an increasing inflation indexed charge per passenger segment flown ranging from to 
the company does not currently believe that the change in federal excise tax computation has placed it at either a significant pricing advantage or disadvantage as compared to the previous computation method 
the company does believe that certain of its low fare competitors may be disadvantaged by the new computation method due to their lower average segment fares and higher average intermediate stops as compared to the company in similar markets 
the company began new service in june  between new york s john f 
kennedy international airport and chicago midway  indianapolis and st 
petersburg  and also added several frequencies between the midwest and the west coast for the summer season 
new york service to chicago midway and st 
petersburg was retained for the winter season

in and  ground package revenues were un changed at million 
in  total ambassadair packages sold increased over  and the average revenue earned for each ground package sold increased between periods 
during  the number of ata vacations ground packages sold increased as compared to lack of growth in the number of ground packages sold between periods was mainly due to the reduction of the company s scheduled service operations between years 
during  the average revenue earned for each ground package sold decreased as compared to other revenues 
other revenues decreased to million in  as compared to million in  primarily due to a reduction in revenues earned between periods by providing substitute service to other airlines  partially offset by increases in other miscellaneous revenue categories 
operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits expense in in creased to million from million in approximately million of the increase between periods was attributable to changes made in the third quarter of in senior executive positions and associated senior executive compensation plans 
special compensation totaling million was prepaid to the company s former president and chief executive officer during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  which was being amortized to expense over the anticipated two year term of his employment ending august due to his resignation in late may  a one time charge to expense for the unamortized million prepaid balance was made in the second quarter of to salaries  wages and benefits  whereas no such charge to expense was incurred in the prior year 
the cost of salaries and wages earned by cockpit crew members and related flight operations support staff in was approximately million higher than in these cost increases were incurred even though jet block hours flown by cockpit crew members declined by between periods 
this increase in the unit cost of cockpit crews was attributable to the following significant factors i the implementation of the cockpit crew collective bargaining agreement in august  under which a rate increase became effective  ii crew utilization for us military flying was significantly lower than for scheduled service and tour operator flying  and us military block hours increased as a percentage of total block hours to in  as compared to in  iii cockpit crew shortages during the first three quarters of resulted in the need to increase premium pay to cockpit crew members in order to adequately staff the spring and summer flying schedule  and iv cockpit crew productivity was reduced by the fleet restructuring completed during  which increased the percentage of jet block hours flown by three crew member aircraft lockheed l and boeing to in  as compared to in the salaries  wages and benefits cost for other employee groups declined by million in as compared to these costs declined partially as a result of the decline in equivalent full time employment between periods 
total equivalent full time employment declined by between years  although equivalent full time employment in the fourth quarter of was higher than in the fourth quarter of the increase in employment in late was primarily due to the addition of cockpit and cabin crews and reservations agents to adequately staff expected growth in flying capacity in compared to the fourth quarter of when the company had just completed significant staff reductions 
in addition to those planned staff reductions completed during the fourth quarter of  the change in salaries  wages and benefits expense for other employee groups was significantly affected by reduced employment in maintenance and engineering  which accounted for a million reduction in expense between and employment of maintenance and engineering staff  such as airframe and powerplant mechanics and engineers  was constrained in by broad shortages in related labor markets attributable to very strong current demand for these skills within the airline industry 
the company compensated for some of these shortages in by acquiring these skills through third party contract labor vendors 
the cost of maintenance contract labor which is a component of aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs increased by million in as compared to salaries  wages and benefits cost per asm increased in to cents  as compared to cents in fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense for decreased to million from million in during  as compared to  the company consumed fewer gallons of jet fuel for flying operations  which resulted in a reduction in fuel expense of approximately million between periods 
the reduction in jet fuel consumed was due to the reduced number of block hours of jet flying operations between years 
the company flew  jet block hours in  as compared to  jet block hours in  a decrease of between periods 
during  the company s average cost per gallon of fuel consumed decreased by as compared to  which resulted in a decrease in fuel and oil expense of approximately million between years 
also  during the last three quarters of  the company incurred approximately million in fuel and oil expense to operate the jetstream aircraft under its agreement with chicago express  which was not in effect in the last three quarters of fuel and oil expense increased to cents per asm in  as compared to cents per asm in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in  as compared to million in depreciation expense attributable to owned airframes and engines decreased million in as compared to the company reduced its year over year investment in engines and airframe improvements due to the reconfiguration of the boeing fleet in the fourth quarter of as a result of the net reduction of four boeing aircraft at the end of  as compared to the end of  and the complete elimination of pratt whitney powered boeing s from the fleet  some airframe and leasehold improvements were disposed of  and all spare pratt whitney engines and rotable parts were reclassified as assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet 
none of these assets  therefore  gave rise to depreciation expense in the company did increase its investment in computer equipment and furniture and fixtures between years  placed the west bay of the renovated midway hangar no 
into service in mid  and incurred increased debt issue costs between years relating to debt facility and senior unsecured notes issued  as well as aircraft lease negotiations completed primarily in the fourth quarter of these changes  together with increased costs pertaining to remaining rotable components and the provision for obsolescence of aircraft parts inventories  resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of million in as compared to amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls increased million in as compared to after including the offsetting amortization associated with manufacturers credits 
changes to the cost of overhaul amortization were partly due to the reduction of total block hours and cycles flown between comparable periods 
this expense was also favorably impacted by the late reconfiguration of the boeing fleet and  in particular  the disposal of all pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft 
all unamortized net book values of engine and airframe overhauls pertaining to the pratt whitney powered aircraft were charged to the cost of the disposal of these assets in the third quarter of the company s seven remaining rolls royce powered boeing aircraft  four of which were delivered new from the manufacturer in late and late  are not presently generating any engine and airframe overhaul expense since the initial post delivery overhauls for the rolls royce powered boeing s are not yet due under the company s maintenance programs 
the net reduction in engine and airframe amortization expense in pertaining to changes in the company s boeing fleet was approximately million as compared to engine and airframe amortization for the company s fleet of boeing aircraft increased by approximately million in as compared to due to the on going expansion of this fleet type and due to the completion of new overhauls for pratt whitney jtd engines that power the boeing fleet 
the increase between years in engine and airframe amortization expense for the company s lockheed l fleet was approximately million  which was primarily due to the addition of airframe overhauls to the fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling  landing and navigation fees decreased by to million in  as compared to million in due to the restructuring of scheduled service in the fourth quarter of  the absolute number of system wide jet departures between and declined by to  from  which resulted in approximately million in volume related handling and landing expense reductions between periods 
this volume related decline was partially offset  however  by an approximately million price related handling and landing expense increase between periods attributable primarily to a change in jet departure mix 
as a result of the reduction in the company s narrow body boeing fleet and the shift of revenue production towards charter operations  the company s jet departures in included proportionately more international and wide body operations than in in  of the company s jet departures were operated with wide body aircraft  as compared to in  and of the company s jet departures were from international locations  as compared to in the prior year 
the cost per asm for handling  landing and navigation fees increased to cents in  from cents in aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the cost per asm decreased by to cents in  as compared to cents in the prior year 
repair costs were million lower in as compared to the prior year 
this was due to a reduction in both the total number of repairs performed and the average unit cost of repairs between periods 
negotiations were completed in early with several repair vendors which resulted in reduced unit charges for some repair activity 
additionally  the company established a maintenance disposition board in late which carefully reviews significant repair decisions in light of anticipated fleet requirements and the available quantity of serviceable components in stock 
the cost of expendable parts consumed increased million in  as compared to the increase in the cost of expendable parts consumed was closely related to the company s light airframe maintenance check programs for its fleet  which resulted in several more light airframe checks being completed in than in the previous year 
the cost of maintenance contract labor increased by million in  as compared to as explained above under salaries  wages and benefits  the company increased its utilization of maintenance contract labor in to compensate for some employment shortages of airframe and powerplant mechanics and engineers 
the cost of parts loans and exchanges was million lower in  as compared to  due to improved internal procedures to limit the need for such loans and exchanges 
return condition expenses accrued in were million lower than in  primarily due to the negotiation of new terms and conditions for several aircraft leases during  which eliminated return condition obligations which had existed prior to those negotiations 
aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals expense for decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the reconfiguration of the company s boeing fleet in the fourth quarter of  as a result of which the number of boeing aircraft operated by the company was reduced by four units 
the reduction in the size of the boeing fleet was an integral component of the company s restructuring of scheduled service based upon profitability analysis which disclosed that  for some uses of the boeing in the company s markets  it was more profitable to substitute other aircraft with lower ownership costs 
aircraft rentals expense declined by million between and as a result of the boeing fleet restructuring 
four additional boeing aircraft were acquired and financed by sale leasebacks at various times during the first three quarters of  while one boeing aircraft previously on an operating lease was purchased during the second quarter of and was subsequently sold and leased back in september the net increase in leased boeing aircraft between years  together with the incorporation of hushkits into new sale leasebacks of several boeing aircraft between periods  added approximately million in aircraft rentals expense between and aircraft rentals expense for was cents per asm  a decrease of from cents per asm in the period to period decrease in the size of the boeing fleet was a significant factor in this change since the rental cost of asms produced by this fleet type was significantly higher than for the company s other aircraft 
crew and other employee travel 
the cost of crew and other employee travel increased to million in  as compared to million in during  the company s average full time equivalent cockpit and cabin crew employment was lower as compared to the prior year  even though jet block hours decreased by only between periods 
although the company did experience some crew shortages in the first quarter of associated with severe winter weather  shortages of both cockpit and cabin crews were more chronic in the first nine months of  and per crew member travel costs were consequently higher since crews spent greater amounts of time away from their bases to operate the company s schedule 
in addition  average crew travel costs for the us military and specialty charter businesses are much higher than for track charter and scheduled service since these flights more often operate away from crew bases 
the cost per asm for crew and other employee travel increased to cents in  as compared to cents in passenger service 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the cost of passenger service increased in to million  as compared to million in this change between periods was primarily due to an increase of approximately in the average cost to cater each passenger  offset by a decrease of in jet passengers boarded to  in  as compared to  in catering unit cost increased due to a change in the mix of passengers boarded from fewer scheduled service toward more charter and military passengers  the latter passengers  particularly military  are the most expensive passengers to cater in the company s business mix 
military and charter passengers accounted for of passengers boarded in  as compared to of passengers boarded in the cost per asm of passenger service increased to cents in  as compared to cents in commissions 
commissions expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in scheduled service commissions expense declined by million between periods  primarily as a result of the decline in total scheduled service revenues earned  and also partly as a result of an industry wide reduction in the standard travel agency commission rate from to during october military and commercial charter commissions expense increased by million and million  respectively  due to the increased level of commissionable revenues earned in those business units in  as compared to the cost per asm of commissions expense increased by to cents in  as compared to cents in other selling expenses 
other selling expenses decreased to million in  as compared to million in crs fees decreased million in  as compared to due to both a decrease in total crs bookings made for the smaller scheduled service business unit between periods  and due to a reduction in the average cost of each crs booking made between years 
toll free telephone costs decreased million between periods due to less usage and lower rates 
other selling cost per asm decreased to cents in  as compared to cents in the previous year 
ground package cost 
ground package cost increased to million in  as compared to million in the increase in cost between periods was primarily due to a increase in the number of ambassadair ground packages sold 
there was no material change in the average cost of ground packages sold between years 
ground package cost per asm increased by to cents in  as compared to cents in advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company incurs advertising costs primarily to support single seat scheduled service sales and the sale of air and ground packages 
advertising support for these lines of business was increased in consistent with the company s overall strategy to enhance rasm in these businesses through increases in load factor and yield 
additionally  advertising was comparatively low in the third quarter of due to the restructuring of numerous scheduled service markets which was initiated in the latter part of that quarter 
the cost per asm of advertising increased to cents in  as compared to cents in this increase in cost per asm resulted from higher absolute advertising dollars being spent in a period of declining asms  but was nevertheless an integral part of the company s strategy in to enhance profitability in the scheduled service business 
facilities and other rentals 
the cost of facility and other rentals decreased to million in  as compared to million in there were some changes in specific facilities utilized by the company between periods  such as the addition of hangar space at chicago midway and the elimination of airport facilities at boston 
the company also reduced total facility expense between years through the sublease of excess facilities to third parties 
the cost per asm for facility and other rentals was unchanged between periods at cents 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in other operating expenses which experienced significant increases between years included i the cost of the chicago express agreement  and ii the cost of property and sales taxes 
other operating expenses which experienced significant decreases between periods included i the cost of insurance  ii the cost of data and voice communications  and iii the cost of professional consulting fees 
several other categories of other operating expenses were lower in than in  primarily due to the smaller size of the airline between periods 
other operating cost per asm increased to cents in  as compared to cents in interest income and expense 
interest expense in increased to million  as compared to million in the increase in interest expense between periods was primarily due to the change in the company s capital structure from i the offering of the notes  and ii the implementation of the credit facility 
during  the weighted average borrowings were approximately million  as compared to million in the weighted average effective interest rate applicable to the company s borrowings in was  as compared to in the increase in the weighted average effective interest rates between years was primarily due to the interest rate applicable to the unsecured notes  which was higher than the average interest rates applicable to borrowings under the former credit facility 
the company invested excess cash balances in short term government securities and commercial paper and thereby earned million in interest income in  an increase of over interest income of million earned in income tax expense 
in  the company recorded million in income tax expense applicable to the income before income taxes for that year  while in income tax credits of million were recognized pertaining to the loss before income taxes for that year of million 
the effective tax rate applicable to was  while the effective tax rate applicable to was 
income tax expense and credits in both periods were affected by the non deductibility for federal income tax purposes of of amounts paid for crew per diem 
the effect of this and other permanent differences on the effective income tax rate for financial accounting purposes becomes more pronounced in cases where before tax income or loss approaches zero  which was a significant cause for the unusually high effective tax rate in income tax expense and the effective tax rate for were also significantly affected by the one time million charge to salaries  wages and benefits in the second quarter of for the executive compensation package provided to the company s former president and chief executive officer 
of the total compensation paid to this former executive of the company in  approximately million was non deductible against the company s federal taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
the company has historically financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements from cash flow from operations and long term borrowings from banks and other lenders 
as described further below  in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  the company completed several separate financings designed to lengthen the maturity of its long term debt and diversify its credit sources  including the issuance of million total in two series of unsecured notes  and the renegotiation of a revolving credit facility that had an extended maturity  lower interest rate and less restrictive covenants than the former credit facility 
in  and  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities between periods was attributable to such factors as increased earnings and related deferred income taxes  higher depreciation and amortization  growth in air traffic liabilities  higher accrued expenses and other factors 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively  in  and such amounts primarily included capital expenditures totaling million  million and million  respectively  for engine and airframe overhauls  airframe improvements  hushkit installations  the purchase of rotable parts  and for purchase deposits made on boeing and lockheed l aircraft scheduled for future delivery 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million  respectively  for  and financing activities in the period included proceeds of million from the sale of unsecured notes  offset by million in credit facility and other debt repayments 
in  proceeds of million were recorded from the sale of unsecured notes  which was applied primarily to the repayment of other long term debt 
aircraft and fleet transactions 
in november  the company signed a purchase agreement for six new boeing s which  as subsequently amended  now provides for total aircraft to be delivered between and in conjunction with the boeing purchase agreement  the company entered into a separate agreement with rolls royce commercial aero engines limited for rb e engines to power the ten boeing aircraft and to provide one spare engine 
under the rolls royce agreement  which became effective january   rolls royce has provided the company various spare parts credits and engine overhaul cost guarantees 
the company accepted delivery of the first seven aircraft under these agreements in september and december  november and december  november  july and december  all of which were financed under leases accounted for as operating leases 
the aggregate purchase price under these two agreements for the remaining three aircraft is approximately million per aircraft  subject to escalation 
the final three deliveries are scheduled for september  october and june advanced payments totaling approximately million million per aircraft are required prior to delivery of the three remaining aircraft  with the remaining purchase price payable at delivery 
as of december   and  the company had recorded fixed asset additions for million  million and million  respectively  in advanced payments applicable to aircraft scheduled for future delivery 
the company intends to finance the remaining three deliveries under this agreement through sale leaseback transactions accounted for as operating leases 
in july the company committed to the purchase of five lockheed l series aircraft  three spare engines and certain associated spare parts 
these aircraft are powered by rolls royce rb b engines 
the company accepted delivery of the first two aircraft under this purchase agreement in and expects to accept delivery of the remaining three in upon delivery of each aircraft  the company intends to complete certain modifications and improvements to the airframes and interiors in order to qualify them to operate in a standard coach seating configuration of seats 
such modifications are expected to require approximately days from date of delivery of the unmodified aircraft from the seller 
the modified aircraft are expected to be placed into revenue service during  operating primarily in the commercial and military government charter businesses 
the company expects that the total cost of the five modified aircraft  together with spare engines and spare parts  will be approximately million 
the company has financed this purchase primarily through the issuance of unsecured notes in december the company purchased an additional rolls royce powered boeing aircraft from an aircraft lessor in september  financing this purchase through a payment of cash and the issuance of a million note 
the note required monthly payments of  in principal and interest from october   through september  with the balance due at maturity 
the company re financed this aircraft through a sale leaseback transaction in december  at which time the note was repaid in full 
the new lease expires in december  at which time the aircraft will be returned to the lessor  unless the lessor exercises its right to leave the aircraft with the company for up to two additional years at a reduced rental amount 
in the fourth quarter of  the company purchased a boeing aircraft which had been previously financed by the company through a lease accounted for as an operating lease  financing this purchase through the issuance of a short term note and a payment of cash 
this note was repaid in the first quarter of the company then issued a long term note secured by this aircraft in september for million  which required repayment of million in october and  per month in principal and interest from november through october  with the balance due in november this note was repaid in december in the second and third quarters of  the company purchased and improved one lockheed l aircraft  which was placed into service in late july financings in on july   the company sold million principal amount of unsecured seven year notes in a private offering under rule a 
the company subsequently completed an exchange offer to holders of the unsecured seven year notes in january  under which offer those notes issued in the original private offering could be tendered in exchange for fully registered notes of equal value 
the net proceeds of the unsecured notes were approximately million  after deduction of costs and fees of issuance 
the company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay in full the company s prior bank facility and will use the balance of the proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include the purchase of additional aircraft and or the refinancing of existing leased aircraft  among other things 
concurrently with the issuance of the unsecured notes  on july   the company entered into a new million revolving credit facility that included up to million for stand by letters of credit 
ata was the borrower under the new credit facility  which was guaranteed by the company and each of the company s other active subsidiaries 
the principal amount of the new facility was scheduled to mature on april   and borrowings were secured by certain lockheed l aircraft and engines 
as of december   the company had borrowed the maximum amount then available against its existing credit facility  of which million was repaid on january  there were no borrowings against the credit facility at december  the company also maintained a million revolving credit facility for its short term borrowing needs and for securing the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings against this credit facility bore interest at the lender s prime rate plus per annum 
there were no borrowings against this facility as of december  and  however  the company did have outstanding letters of credit secured by this facility aggregating million and million  respectively 
no amounts had been drawn against letters of credit at december  or this separate revolving credit facility was eliminated in association with the implementation of the credit facility described below 
financings in and in december  the company sold million principal amount of unsecured senior notes in a public offering 
interest is payable on june and december of each year beginning june  the net proceeds of the million unsecured notes were approximately million  after deducting costs and fees of issuance 
the company plans to use the net proceeds for the purchase of lockheed l aircraft  engines and spare parts  and  together with available cash and bank facility borrowings  for the purchase of boeing adv aircraft  engines  engine hushkits and spare parts 
in january  the company revised the revolving credit facility to provide a maximum of million  including up to million for stand by letters of credit 
the terms and conditions remained the same as the july facility  except that the facility matures january   and borrowings under the facility bear interest  at the option of ata  at either libor plus to or the agent bank s prime rate 
the facility is subject to the same restrictive covenants as the prior facility  except that the facility limits certain non aircraft related capital expenditures to million  rather than the million limitation in the prior revolving credit facility 
aircraft purchase commitments and options 
the company has signed purchase agreements to acquire boeing adv aircraft at agreed prices 
fourteen of these aircraft are currently leased by the company 
the other two aircraft  currently on lease to another airline  may be purchased in  depending upon the exercise of lease extension options available to the current lessee 
the company currently intends to install engine hushkits on of the boeing aircraft currently operated by the company in order to meet federal stage noise regulations for its fleet by december  year until recently many computer programs were written to store only two digits of year related date information in order to make the storage and manipulation of such data more efficient 
programs which use two digit date fields  however  may not be able to distinguish between such years as and in some circumstances  this date limitation could result in system failures or miscalculations  potentially causing disruptions of business processes or system operations 
the date field limitation is frequently referred to as the year problem 
state of readiness 
in the fourth quarter of  the company initiated a year project to address this issue 
during the first quarter of  the company inventoried its internal computer systems  facilities infrastructure  aircraft components and other hardware  and completed a year risk assessment for these items 
during the course of its inventory  the company identified approximately separate computer infrastructure components which are used to support various aspects of its world wide operations 
such components include software packages both purchased and internally developed  operating systems for computers  computer hardware and peripheral devices  local and wide area communications networks  aircraft computers and components  and a variety of other items of technology infrastructure including those associated with the operation of properties and facilities 
the company then classified each of these components using an internal scale to designate the seriousness and immediacy of impact to the company  should the component fail due to lack of compliance with year standards 
the company s year project involves the completion of five specific phases of work 
the first  or awareness phase now complete  includes the creation of a year project team  development of written standards and processes for the year project  communications to company employees about the year problem and the company s approach to addressing it  creation of year compliance standards for newly acquired technology components  and written standards and procedures for year project status reporting 
the second phase is inventory and assessment now complete  which includes such activities as creating an inventory of all technology infrastructure components used by the company  developing standards for assessing and ranking year risk for such components  completing risk assessments for all components  providing year certification standards for such components  development of a critical vendor database  development of renovation standards and guidelines  development of testing standards and guidelines  creation of testing environments  developing an inventory of tools needed to complete assessment  conversion and testing of components  development of year resource budgets  and completion of high level contingency plans 
the third phase is renovation now complete  which includes the conversion  replacement or elimination of selected hardware platforms and devices  operating systems  databases  purchased software  utilities  and internal and external interfaces 
renovation requires the completion and documentation of software and hardware changes  development of replacement systems  and decommissioning systems to be eliminated 
renovation also includes the completion and documentation of unit testing  and the creation of a final test plan for system  integration and stress testing of all changes 
contingency plans will also be updated and completed  based upon completion of renovation efforts and unit test results 
the fourth phase is validation now complete  which includes user acceptance testing of all new or renovated components 
such testing is expected to validate year operational readiness of the individual components  up to but not including testing of the integration of those components with other components sharing common interfaces or other interdependencies 
the fifth phase is implementation now complete  which includes integration testing of individual components as to interfaces and interdependencies with other components or elements of the company s technology infrastructure 
with respect to the computer infrastructure components  the company has prepared approximately individual project plans with tasks and milestones which define the work to be done to complete the five phases of year readiness 
a total of plans are now complete 
a total of plans are currently in progress and are substantially on schedule for future completion 
the remaining plans have not yet commenced  but the company expects to complete them prior to the end of of the total hours of work included in the company s project plans  approximately of such work is now complete 
the company is dependent upon a large number of third party vendors and suppliers who provide essential goods and services to the company throughout the world 
in order to insure that essential goods and services are supplied to the company without interruptions caused by the year problem  the company has undertaken a vendor year readiness project 
some third party vendor relationships are very significant to the company 
the loss of access to some goods and services provided by some vendors  such as tour operator and airline reservation systems  could have severe consequences on the company s business operations 
under the company s vendor readiness plan  significant company vendors have been grouped according to the expected safety  operations or financial impacts from a loss of access to essential goods or services due to the vendor failing to become year compliant  and the expected time and effort which would be required to replace the non compliant vendor with a compliant vendor 
under this classification system  the company has identified tier vendors whose lack of year compliance and the resulting loss of essential goods and services could create immediate and severe safety  operations or financial impact to the company  with replacement of such vendors taking considerable time and effort 
the company has further classified vendors as tier vendors  which could pose significant safety  operations or financial impacts to the company should they be non year compliant  but which impacts would not be immediate and for which only moderate time and effort would be required to locate compliant replacement vendors 
all remaining significant vendors have been classified as tier vendors totaling over  none of which would pose a significant safety  operations or financial impact in the event of non compliance with year standards  and all of which could easily be replaced with alternative vendors 
in addition to the third party dependencies enumerated above  the company is also highly dependent upon the operation of airports and air traffic control systems in the united states and in foreign countries 
each year the company flies to over individual airports world wide which are typically operated by governmental or quasi governmental agencies 
other governmental agencies use computers to provide essential services at airports  such as customs and immigration screening and weather reporting 
as a member of the air transport association year committee  the company is participating with other member airlines to test and validate the year readiness of the air transportation infrastructure such as airports and air traffic control systems 
as yet  no comprehensive inventory and risk assessment of domestic and international airports has been completed  and therefore the company cannot determine to what degree  if any  domestic and international airports are at risk of failing to meet year readiness standards 
under the direction of the air transport association year committee  a separate evaluation of aviation related federal agencies is also in progress 
this evaluation includes the year readiness of the federal aviation administration  particularly with respect to the operation of the domestic air traffic control system  the department of transportation  the immigration and naturalization service  and the national weather service 
based upon representations made by such federal agencies  they expect to be able to provide uninterrupted services to the air transportation industry  including the company  during the year efforts of the air transport association year committee are directed toward completing an independent verification of readiness of these agencies  which is still incomplete at this time 
estimated costs of achieving year readiness 
based upon all data currently available to the company  it presently estimates that the total cost of meeting year standards  including computer and facilities infrastructure  vendor readiness  aircraft and airports  will be approximately million 
such estimated cost includes approximately million in capital expenditures to acquire new software and hardware to replace non compliant computer devices  as well as approximately million in labor and related expenses to perform all year project work to insure the readiness of remaining computer devices for operation after approximately million of this estimated cost has been incurred as of january   with the remaining million to be incurred by the end of it is possible that the company will determine that additional costs beyond those estimated above will be required to complete all year activities as testing and implementation proceeds through the end of year risks and contingency plans 
the company believes that its computer infrastructure project plans and vendor readiness plan  together with its participation on the air transport association year committee  if successfully completed  will mitigate all significant risks of business and operational disruption arising from non compliant computer components 
successful completion of this plan is dependent  however  upon the availability to the company of a wide range of technical skills from both internal and external sources  and is also dependent upon the availability of purchased software and hardware components 
the company cannot be assured that such resources and components can be acquired in the quantities needed  or by the times needed  to successfully complete the year project plan  in which case it is possible that the company could suffer serious disruptions to business processes and operations as a consequence of system failures attributable to the year problem 
in addition  the company cannot be assured that domestic and foreign air transportation infrastructure  such as airports and air traffic control systems  will be fully compliant with year requirements by the end of the company has developed a number of high level contingency plans addressing how it would respond to specific year issues arising from non compliant computer infrastructure components  vendors and government agencies 
such contingency plans will be broadened and formalized as more advanced phases of the company s year project are completed and risks in individual areas are more thoroughly assessed and alternative approaches to existing systems and components are identified 
contingency plans include such strategies as securing alternative vendors and adding staff to implement manual workarounds  where feasible 
future accounting changes in march  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this accounting standard  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   specifically defines the criteria under which costs incurred in connection with internal use computer software projects are to be treated as a current period expense or to be capitalized 
the adoption of sop is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the aicpa issued sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this accounting standard  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   requires that certain costs of start up activities and organization costs be expenses as incurred 
the adoption of sop is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this accounting standard  which is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
the company is evaluating the new statement s provisions and has not yet determined either the date on which it will adopt sfas no 
or the impact of adoption on the results of operations or financial position 
forward looking information information contained within business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking information which can be identified by forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  may  will  should  anticipates  or the negative thereof  or other variations in comparable terminology 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current knowledge of factors affecting the company s business 
the differences between expected outcomes and actual results can be material  depending upon the circumstances 
therefore  where the company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results in any forward looking information  such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and is believed to have a reasonable basis 
the company can provide no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or accomplished as there are many risks associated with business  the airline industry and the company specifically that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including commodity price risk resulting from aircraft fuel price fluctuations and interest rate risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to such changes 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
aircraft fuel 
the company s results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
during  aircraft fuel accounted for approximately of the company s operating expenses 
based on the company s projected fuel consumption  a one cent change in the average annual price per gallon of aircraft fuel would impact the company s annual aircraft fuel expense by approximately million  after the effect of hedging instruments and contractual fuel reimbursement guarantees in place as of december  in order to reduce the short term risk associated with fuel price increases  the company has entered into certain fuel swap contracts and fuel cap agreements 
the company s short term risk is also mitigated by contractual fuel price guarantees contained in the military charter contracts  which enable the company to pass through increases in fuel cost 
both the company s fuel hedging strategy and military fuel guarantees could result in the company not fully benefiting from certain fuel price declines 
as of december   the company had hedged or guaranteed as part of projected military activity  approximately of its projected fuel requirements  including of the first quarter and of the second quarter 
interest rates 
the company s results of operations are affected by fluctuations in market interest rates 
the company has approximately million of variable rate debt available through a revolving credit facility 
in  the company does not project to incur significant borrowings under the facility  so the risk of exposure to market interest rate fluctuations is not significant 
as of december   the company had fixed rate debt with a carrying value of million 
based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments  the fair value of the fixed rate debt is estimated at approximately million 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates was approximately million as of december if average short term interest rates decreased by over average rates  the company s projected interest income from short term investments would decrease by approximately million during part ii continued
