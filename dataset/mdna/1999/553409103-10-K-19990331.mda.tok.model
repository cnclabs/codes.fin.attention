in addition  the company retained the accounts receivable of the health care division of approximately million 
on september   the company sold its commercial operations and its teleservices division for million  prior to any purchase price adjustments  in cash 
as a result of these transactions  the company s consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been reclassified to report the results of operations of its commercial  teleservices and health care divisions as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the following detailed analysis of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
fiscal compared to fiscal results from continuing operations revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal the increase was attributable by division to information technology  million or an increase of and professional services  million or an increase of 
the increases in the information technology and professional services divisions were due to both internal growth and  more significantly  to the revenues of acquired companies 
the revenue for the company s information technology division is obtained through the modis solutions and modis consulting business units 
modis solutions provided approximately and of the division s revenue for the years ended and  as compared to and which was provided by the division s modis consulting unit during the same respective periods 
the company plans to continue to expand the percentage of revenue contributed through its modis solutions unit as it expands that unit s offerings throughout the offices of the modis consulting unit through various cross selling efforts 
during  the company solidified the information technology division s management structure 
the company integrated substantially all of its acquired companies from a managerial perspective  including next generation leadership 
in conjunction with this integration  the company has been able to consolidate its marketing efforts and promote the modis brand name on a national level  as the majority of its services are now offered under the modis brand name 
for example  a major advertising campaign was launched to increase brand awareness to customers and recruits through print ads and airport billboards 
the company believes the managerial integration and unified national marketing plan will provide the company with a platform to increase sales 
the strong progress in our integration efforts in were somewhat attributable to the company satisfying all of its domestic contingent earn out obligations by the end of the company will continue to integrate the back office operations of this division in conjunction with the company s restructuring plan 
in an effort to increase revenue and gross margin percentages  the company has rolled out a new incentive based compensation plan throughout the modis consulting unit 
the company believes this plan will better motivate its employees to stimulate revenue growth and provide an incentive to increase gross margin percentages 
management has observed a current trend in the industry which may possibly enhance the effectiveness of its strategy 
this trend involves the movement of large users of it services to larger  national and international providers of it services 
the company has seen a trend among large national and international customers towards scaled back  preferred vendor lists for supplying it services 
the company believes it is well positioned as one of the companies which can successfully offer services to these customers and achieve selection as a preferred provider 
approximately of the it division s total revenue  are derived from two united kingdom customers 
if these or other customers reduce spending on it services or exclude the company from their vendor lists  then the fiscal it division revenues may experience a decrease if the revenue associated with such customers cannot be replaced 
another trend in the industry that may limit the company s operating strategy has been articulated by some industry analysts 
these industry analysts have speculated that non year related it spending may be negatively effected in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal this theory speculates  among other things  that customers will focus their efforts in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal on testing and implementing legacy systems which have undergone year remediation 
the theory further speculates that this focus will result in a curtailment of spending on such it services as erp implementation and custom software development during as the company s modis solutions unit provides erp implementation and custom software development services  if spending is curtailed  the company may possibly experience some weakness in its erp practice 
the company s professional services division consists of the accounting  legal  engineering technical  career management and consulting and scientific units which contributed    and  respectively  of the professional services division s revenues by group during as compared to   and  respectively  during the shift in the professional services division s revenues towards the accounting unit is primarily the result of the acquisition of a large  international provider of accounting services during june this resulted in approximately six months of post acquisition revenue in fiscal results versus twelve months during fiscal included in the revenues of the professional services division are revenues derived from a project in the company s legal unit and with a certain customer 
the revenues from this project amounted to approximately million  or of the division s total revenue 
this project is scheduled to curtail significantly or be completed during the early part of fiscal  and there is no guarantee that a replacement for that source of revenue will be found 
projects of this nature occur from time to time within the professional services division 
however  management believes it is well positioned to increase revenue through its existing sales force and makes a concerted effort to redeploy consultants after such projects end if possible 
during  the company created and filled the position of president and coo of the professional services division 
this position will be responsible for the operations of all business units of the professional services division 
the company believes this position will create inertia to improve the platform for better operational results throughout the entire professional services division 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the gross margin in the it division decreased from to 
the overall decrease in the it division s gross margin was due to a number of factors  including the increased percentage of the information technology division s revenues generated by the uk operations  which generally contribute a lower gross margin percentage  in certain cases  the inability of the company to time increases in bill rates with increases in pay rates higher benefits costs including mathcing k plan and holiday and vacation pay  inability to use more salaried versus hourly consultants  and the overall decrease in gross margin percentages in the information technology services industry as a whole 
this industry decrease may be attributed to the aforementioned trend by large users of it services toward scaled back preferred vendor lists 
the aim of such vendor list reductions is to push greater services revenue through fewer providers with the tradeoff being lower gross margin percentages to the providers 
if in the future a greater portion of the company s revenues are generated through preferred vendor contracts  it is possible that this may result in a decrease in gross margin percentages  although gross margin dollars may increase 
the decrease in gross margin percentages in the information technology services industry may also be attributed to a continued shortage of skilled it workers worldwide 
the current shortage of skilled it workers creates an upward pressure on pay rates for such workers 
if the company must continue to pay higher wages to attract and retain skilled workers and is not able to completely pass this increase through to its customers  this may result in somewhat depressed gross margin percentages 
the gross margin in the professional services division decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the overall decrease in the professional services gross margin was due primarily to an increased percentage of revenues from the united kingdom  increased salary pressures due to a continued shortage of skilled workers  higher benefits costs including a matching k plan and holiday and vacation pay  and increased competition within the segment including downward pricing pressure from competitors 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal included in operating expenses in fiscal are million in restructuring and impairment charges associated with the company s integration and strategic repositioning plan the restructuring plan 
operating expenses before these non recurring costs as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal the decrease was due to the company s ability to spread its expenses over a larger revenue base 
the company s general and administrative g a expenses before the non recurring charges increased million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in g a expenses was primarily related to the effects of acquisitions made by the company  internal growth of the operating companies post acquisition  investments made to improve infrastructure and to develop technical practices and increased expenses at the corporate level to support the growth of the company including sales  marketing and brand recognition 
included in g a expenses during both and are the costs associated with projects underway to ensure accurate date recognition and data processing with respect to the year as it relates to the company s business  operations  customers and vendors 
these costs have been immaterial to date and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity in the future

restructuring and impairment charge 
in december  the company s board of directors approved a restructuring plan to strengthen overall profitability of the company by implementing a back office integration program and branch repositioning plan in an effort to consolidate or close branches whose financial performance does not meet the company s expectations 
the company recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of million in relation to the restructuring plan 
the restructuring component of the million charge is based  in part  on the evaluation of objective evidence of probable obligations to be incurred by the company or of specifically identified assets 
the company  formerly accustaff incorporated  was formed in and grew over the next years through both acquisitions and internal growth 
prior to the disposition of the commercial operations and the teleservices and health care divisions in  the company was largely organized and structured from an administrative  operations and systems capabilities standpoint as a commercial staffing business 
the restructuring plan focuses on meeting the needs of an information technology and professional services company and is designed to result in a back office environment tailored to serve these businesses 
upon completion of the restructuring plan  certain back office operations will be centralized at the company s headquarters and possibly one additional location  and certain positions which were necessary under the previous organizational and operational structure will be eliminated 
the restructuring plan calls for the consolidation or closing of professional services division branches  certain organizational improvements and the consolidation of back office operations 
this restructuring  which will result in the elimination of approximately positions  will be completed over a to month period 
the reduction in annualized revenue and operating losses from the consolidation or closing of the professional services branches is estimated to be million and million  respectively 
in addition  the company estimates an annual operating cost reduction of million as a result of the consolidation of the back office operations 
the company expects to begin to realize the benefits of the cost reductions in the third quarter of and realize the majority of the annualized benefits in fiscal the major components of the restructuring and impairment plan include costs to recognize severance and related benefits for the approximately employees to be terminated of million 
the severance and related benefit accruals are based on the company s severance plan and other contractual termination provisions 
these accruals include amounts to be paid to employees upon termination of employment 
prior to december   management had approved and committed the company to a plan that involved the involuntary termination of certain employees 
the benefit arrangements associated with this plan were communicated to all employees in december the plan specifically identified the number of employees to be terminated and their job classifications  costs to write down certain furniture  fixtures and computer equipment to net realizable value at branches not performing up to the company s expectations of million  costs to write down goodwill associated with the acquisition of legal information technology  inc which was acquired in january   calculated in accordance with sfas as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies goodwill of million  costs to terminate leases and other exit and shutdown costs associated with the consolidated or closed branches and back office operations  including closing the facilities of million  and costs to adjust accounts receivable due to the expected increase in bad debts which results directly from the termination of employees which causes a change in client relationships which results when severed branch and back office administrative employees  who have the knowledge to effectively pursue collections are terminated of million 
these costs were based upon management s best estimates based upon available information 
since payments pursuant to the restructuring plan will not commence until fiscal  there were no charges recognized by the company against the restructuring reserve as of december   at which time the total restructuring reserve amount of million which does not include the million goodwill impairment charge which was recorded against goodwill in the fouth quarter of fiscal was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities since payments pursuant to the restructuring plan will not commence until fiscal income from operations

interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from the utilization of the company s credit facility 
the increase in interest expense was partially offset by interest and other income of from primarily four sources the sale of the company s commercial and teleservices divisions and the resultant net cash proceeds of approximately million net of million used to pay off and terminate the company s then existing credit facility which earned interest income from october  through december   the resulting interest expense savings from october  through december  from paying off the existing credit facility the new facility did not have a balance as of december   investment income from certain investments owned by the company  and interest income earned from cash on hand at certain subsidiaries of the company

the principal reason for the decrease in the company s working capital is that the company has recognized a million current tax liability as of december  relating to the sale of its commercial operations and teleservices division 
the majority of the proceeds from the sale have been used to pay down long term debt under its credit facility which did not have a balance as of december  and to repurchase the company s common stock 
for the year ended december   the company generated million of cash flow from operations 
for the year ended december   the company generated million of cash flow from operations

the company  pursuant to the asap  agreed to compensate the brokerage firm for any increases in the company s stock price that would cause the brokerage firm to pay an amount to purchase the stock over the asap price 
conversely  the company would receive a refund in the purchase price if the company s stock price fell below the asap price 
subsequent to december   the company used refunded proceeds from the asap to complete the program during january and february  with the repurchase of approximately  shares  bringing the total shares repurchased under the program to approximately  shares 
all of these shares were retired upon purchase 
for the years ended december  and  the company generated million and million  respectively  of cash flow from financing activities 
during fiscal  this amount primarily represented net borrowings from the company s credit facility  which were used primarily to fund acquisitions 
during fiscal  the company generated the majority of its cash flows from financing activities through the public sale of company common stock

other matters year compliance the following disclosure is a year readiness disclosure statement pursuant to the year readiness and disclosure act 
during the company began projects to address potential problems within the company s operations which could result from the century change in the year in  the company created a year project office to oversee year related projects and to address potential problems within the company s operations  which could result from the century change in the year the project office reports to the company s board of directors and is staffed primarily with representatives of the company s information systems department  and has access to key associates in all areas of the company s operations 
the project office also uses outside consultants on an as needed basis 
a four phase approach has been utilized to address the year issues an inventory phase to identify all computer based systems and applications including embedded systems which might not be year compliant  an assessment phase to determine what revisions or replacements would be necessary to achieve year compliance and identification of remediation priorities which would best serve the company s business interests  a conversion phase to implement the actions necessary to achieve compliance and to conduct the tests necessary to verify that the systems are operational  and an implementation phase to transition the compliant systems into the everyday operations of the company 
management believes that the four phases are approximately    and complete  respectively 
the company s corporate accounting  payroll and human resources systems are recent implementations installed since june of mainstream computer products from vendors such as peoplesoft  informix  microsoft  digital equipment corporation and compaq 
the company is near completion of year required upgrades for corporate hardware systems  operating systems  network systems  database systems and applications systems 
this project is in process  and on schedule with an anticipated completion date of may the company operates approximately branches  primarily in the us  canada and the united kingdom 
the branch network relies on a variety of front office automation systems to provide sales support for resume tracking and client contact management 
because of the diverse architectural nature of these systems together with the relative ease with which backup contingency procedures can be implemented in the event of an individual branch system outage  the company does not believe that these systems pose a material year risk 
nevertheless  the company has completed inventory and assessment phases for all branch locations 
in conjunction with other business related integration projects  the company is actively replacing noncompliant year branch hardware and software with year compliant products 
the company expects that this replacement process will be complete in july to date  the company has found that less than of branch workstations require hardware or software upgrades for year purposes 
milestones and implementation dates and the cost of the company s year readiness program are subject to change based on new circumstances that may arise or new information becoming available  that may change underlying assumptions or requirements 
further  there are no assurances that the company will identify all data handling problems in its business systems or that the company will be able to successfully remedy year items that are discovered 
non it systems have also been assessed and inventoried 
potential year risks in these systems includes landlord controlled systems  such as heating and cooling systems  automated security systems  elevators  and office equipment  phone systems  facsimile machines and copiers 
the company has requested assessments of non it systems for year compliance from landlords and office equipment vendors 
based on these responses that the company has received  the company believes that the year risk of non it systems failure is not material 
the company has budgeted approximately million to address the year issues  which includes the estimated cost of the salaries of associates and the fees of consultants addressing the issue 
this cost represents approximately of the company s total mis budget 
approximately has been incurred to date for outside consultants  software and hardware applications  and dedicated personnel 
the company does not separately track the internal costs incurred for portions of the year compliance project that are completed as a part of other business related projects 
such costs are principally the related payroll costs for the company s information systems group 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and funds available under the company s credit facility as well as cash on hand are sufficient to fund these costs 
as a part of the year review  the company is examining its relationships with certain key outside vendors and others with whom it has significant business relationships to determine to the extent practical the degree of such parties year compliance and to develop strategies and alternatives for working with them through the century change 
other than its banking relationships  which include only large  federally insured institutions  and utilities electrical power  telecommunications  water and related items  the company does not have a relationship with any third party which is material to the operations of the company and  therefore  believes that the failure of any such party to be year compliant would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
however  banking or utility failures at the company s branches or with its customers could have a material effect on the company s revenue sources and could disrupt the payment cycle of certain of the company s customers 
should the company or a third party with whom the company deals have a systems failure due to the century change  the company does not expect any such effect to be material 
the company is developing contingency plans for alternative methods of transaction processing and estimates that such plans will be finalized by august quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following assessment of the company s market risks does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political  economic  tax and other credit risks 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s short term and long term debt obligations and to the company s investments 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents including deposits in banks  government securities  money market funds  and short term investments with maturities  when acquired  of days or less 
the company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by placing these funds with high credit quality issuers 
the company constantly evaluates its invested funds to respond appropriately to a reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the company s short term and long term debt obligations totaled million as of december  and the company had million available under its current credit facility 
the debt obligations consist of notes payable to former shareholders of acquired corporations  are at a fixed rate of interest  and extend through the interest rate risk on these obligations is thus immaterial due to the dollar amount and fixed nature of these obligations 
the interest rate on the credit facility is variable  but there were no amounts outstanding on the facility as of december  foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange rate changes impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
the company generated approximately of fiscal consolidated revenues from international operations  of which were from the united kingdom and of which were from other countries 
thus  of international revenues were derived from the united kingdom  whose currency has not fluctuated materially against the united states dollar in fiscal foreign exchange translation gains and losses have been and are as of december  immaterial 
the company did not hold or enter into any foreign currency derivative instruments as of december  factors which may impact future results and financial condition effect of fluctuations in the general economy demand for the company s information technology and professional business services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity in the markets served by the company 
during periods of slowing economic activity  companies may reduce the use of outside consultants and staff augmentation services prior to undertaking layoffs of full time employees 
also during such periods  companies may elect to defer installation of new information technology systems and platforms such as enterprise resource planning systems or upgrades to existing systems and platforms 
year remediation and testing for existing information technology systems may have a similiar effect 
as a result  any significant economic downturn or year impact could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company may also be adversely effected by consolidations through mergers and otherwise of main customers or between major customers with non customers 
these consolidations as well as corporate downsizings may result in redundant functions or services and a resulting reduction in demand by such customers for the company s services 
also  spending for outsourced business services may be put on hold until the consolidations are completed 
competition the company s industry segments are intensely competitive and highly fragmented  with few barriers to entry by potential competitors 
the company faces significant competition in the markets that it serves and will face significant competition in any geographic market that it may enter 
in each market and industry segment in which the company operates  it competes for both clients and qualified professionals with other firms offering similar services 
competition creates an aggressive pricing environment and higher wage costs  which puts pressure on gross margins 
ability to recruit and retain professional employees the company depends on its ability to recruit and retain employees who possess the skills  experience and or professional certifications necessary to meet the requirements of the company s clients 
competition for individuals possessing the requisite criteria is intense  particularly in certain specialized it and professional skill areas 
the company often competes with its own clients in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that qualified personnel will be available and recruited in sufficient numbers on economic terms acceptable to the company 
the continuing shortage of qualified it consultants may adversely affect the company s ability to increase revenue 
this shortage may be exacerbated by the difficulties of utilizing the services of qualified foreign nationals working in the united states under h b visas 
the use of these consultants requires both the company and these foreign nationals to comply with united states immigration laws 
ability to continue acquisition strategy  ability to integrate acquired operations the company has experienced significant growth in the past through acquisitions 
although the company continues to seek acquisition opportunities  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate acquisitions on economic terms acceptable to the company or that the company will be able to successfully identify acquisition candidates and integrate all acquired operations into the company 
possible changes in governmental regulations from time to time  legislation is proposed in the united states congress  state legislative bodies and by foreign governments that would have the effect of requiring employers to provide the same or similar employee benefits to consultants and other temporary personnel as those provided to full time employees 
the enactment of such legislation would eliminate one of the key economic reasons for outsourcing certain human resources and could significantly adversely impact the company s staff augmentation business 
in addition  the company s costs could increase as a result of future laws or regulations that address insurance  benefits or other employment related matters 
there can be no assurance that the company could successfully pass any such increased costs to its clients 
possible year exposure the it division performs both year remediation services as well as system upgrades and enhancements for clients 
there is some possibility that customers who experience system failures related to year may institute actions against their it vendors  including the company 
there is no ability to quantify the likelihood or merit of any such claims  but if a significant number of such claims are asserted against the company or if one or more customers assert meritorious claims  such claims may result in material adverse effects on the company s results of operations and financial condition
