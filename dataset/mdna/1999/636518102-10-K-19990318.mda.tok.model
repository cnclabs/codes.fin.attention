item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in this document contains trend analysis and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements throughout this document as a result of a number of important factors 
for a discussion of important factors that could affect the company s results  please refer to the risk factors set forth below in factors affecting the company s business  in the financial line item discussions below and elsewhere in this document 
overview national instruments corporation designs  develops  manufactures and markets instrumentation and automation software and specialty interface cards for general commercial  industrial and scientific applications 
the company offers hundreds of products used to create virtual instrumentation systems for measurement and automation 
the company has identified two major markets for its products test and measurement and industrial automation 
many of the company s products may be used in either environment  and consequently  specific application of the company s products is determined by the end customer and often is not known to the company at the time of sale 
the company s products are used in a variety of applications from research and development to production testing and industrial control 
in test and measurement applications  the company s products can be used to monitor and control traditional instruments or to create computer based instruments that can replace traditional instruments 
in industrial automation applications  the company s products can be used in the same ways as in test and measurement and can also be used to integrate measurement functionality with process automation capabilities 
the company sells to a large number of customers in a wide variety of industries 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in  or the company s revenues have grown every year since and the company has been profitable in every year since there can be no assurance that the company s net sales will continue to grow or that the company will remain profitable in future periods 
as a result  the company believes historical results of operations should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income years ended december  net sales north america europe asia pacific consolidated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development 
general and administrative total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense net foreign exchange loss 
income before income taxes 
provision for income taxes 
net income net sales 
in  net sales for the company s products reached million  a increase from the level achieved in  which followed an increase in net sales of in over the level achieved in this year marks the twenty second year of double digit annual sales growth 
the increase in sales in these periods is primarily attributable to the introduction of new and upgraded products in each period  increased market acceptance of the company s products in each of the major geographical areas in which the company operates  and an expanded customer base 
the decrease in the us dollar annual growth rate  as compared to in  is attributed to a slowdown in sales growth in north america and asia pacific 
north american revenue was million in  an increase of from  following a increase in over the increase in sales in north america in is primarily attributable to increased demand for the company s products in the telecom and automotive industries and the industrial automation market 
the decrease in the north american revenue growth rate is attributed to a decrease in sales of the company s products as a result of an overall downturn in the test and measurement market 
this downturn was most pronounced in sales to customers in the automated test equipment  semiconductor  defense and aerospace industries 
the slowdown in the automated test equipment and semiconductor markets is partially attributable to the effect on the us economy of the asian economic situation 
in addition  the company was not successful in increasing its us field sales force until the fourth quarter of european revenue was million in  an increase of over  following a increase in from the increase in revenue growth in europe is primarily attributable to market acceptance of the company s products  the strong local economies and the company s expansion in its european sales force 
asia pacific revenue grew to million in  which followed a increase in over levels 
the decrease in the asia pacific revenue growth rate during is primarily attributed to the weakening of the japanese yen  korean won and other asian currencies and the weak state of these economies 
see the discussion below for more information concerning the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales growth 
international sales sales to customers outside of north america accounted for  and of the company s consolidated net sales for  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to expand its international operations by increasing market presence in existing markets  and continuing to use distributors to sell its products in countries in which the sales volume does not justify direct sales activities 
the company s international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the company s sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the company is subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
in particular  increases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies decrease the us dollar value of foreign sales requiring the company either to increase its price in the local currency  which could render the company s product prices noncompetitive  or to suffer reduced revenues and gross margins as measured in us dollars 
these dynamics have adversely affected revenue growth in international markets in and the company s foreign currency hedging program includes both foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts to reduce the effect of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  the hedging program will not eliminate all of the company s foreign exchange risks 
see foreign exchange gain loss below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales made by the company s direct sales offices in europe and asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and this weighted average value of the us dollar increased by  causing an equivalent decrease in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated net sales for would have been million representing an increase of million  which represents consolidated sales growth 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated operating expenses would have been million  representing an increase of million 
the preceding proforma amounts and percentages are presented for comparison purposes 
gross profit 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit represented  and in   and  respectively 
the relatively high software content of the company s products is demonstrated in the gross margins achieved by the company 
in  the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the weak asia pacific economies negatively impacted revenue growth and gross margin 
a lesser factor affecting gross margin includes increased manufacturing expenses attributable to the addition of a third production line in april the higher margin in is the result of reduced direct material costs used in production and the favorable leveraging of our production overhead expenses against the increase in sales 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain its historical margin 
the marketplace for the company s products dictates that many of the company s products be shipped very quickly after an order is received 
as a result  the company is required to maintain significant inventories 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for the company due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by the company or its competitors of products embodying new technology 
while the company maintains valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and management continues to monitor the adequacy of such valuation allowances  there can be no assurance that such valuation allowances will be sufficient 
the company believes its current manufacturing capacity is more than adequate to meet current needs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense in increased from  which followed an increase of in from the increase in the expense in absolute amounts during and is primarily attributable to programs to increase the company s international presence in both the european and asia pacific markets  increases in sales and marketing personnel both internationally and in north america  increased marketing for new products and a worldwide seminar series 
sales and marketing personnel increased by during from at december  to at december  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in and the company expects sales and marketing expenses in future periods to increase in absolute dollars  and to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on initial marketing and advertising campaign costs associated with major new product releases and entry into new market areas  increasing product demonstration costs and the timing of domestic and international conferences and trade shows 
research and development 
research and development expense in increased compared to following an increase of in over excluding the effect of acquisition of products  technology and assets  research and development expense grew  and during  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s acquisitions 
the increase in research and development expenditures excluding the acquisition related charges in and in absolute amounts and as a percentage of sales in each period was primarily due to the hiring of additional product development engineers 
research and development personnel increased from at december  to at december  the company believes that a significant investment in research and development is required to remain competitive and continue revenue growth 
the company capitalizes software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the company amortizes such costs over the related product s estimated economic life  generally three years  beginning when a product becomes available for general release 
amortization expense totaled million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization expense is due primarily to amortization of  of purchased software capitalized in the datalog acquisition 
software development costs capitalized during such years were million  million and million  respectively 
the levels of capitalization for were primarily a result of labview and  ni daq and purchased software development costs related to the datalog acquisition 
the significant items capitalized in include ni daq  labview  labwindows cvi and purchased software development costs related to the nulogic acquisition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of intangibles 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in increased from  considerably lower than the increase in revenue of 
the continued leveraging of expenses is primarily due to the implementation of new management information systems in the us  europe and japan 
in absolute dollars  the majority of the increase was comprised of cost attributable to staffing increases in the information system department 
support of the new management information systems and web based applications was the main focus areas for incremental investment in the increase followed an increase in which also was driven by training and implementation costs of the new management information systems 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to during this marks the third consecutive year of reduced general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue 
this decline is attributable to the efficiencies brought on by the improvements made in recent years to the worldwide management information system 
the company expects that general and administrative costs will continue to increase in absolute amounts as the company continues to invest in developing web based commerce and management information systems 
interest income and expense 
interest income in was flat from  which followed an increase of in from the primary source of interest income is from the investment of proceeds from the company s issuance of common stock under an initial public offering in march and cash flow generated from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
during the first half of  million was used to pay construction costs of the company s new office building 
during  interest income increased due to the investment of cash generated from operations 
interest expense decreased from  which followed a decrease of in from interest expense represents less than of net sales and fluctuates as a result of bank borrowings and interest terms thereon 
the decrease in interest expense in from is attributed to scheduled repayments on the manufacturing facility loan 
the large decrease in interest expense from to is attributed to repayments of equipment and facility loans during january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s debt 
foreign exchange gain loss 
the company experienced net foreign exchange losses of  in  compared to losses of million and  in and  respectively 
these results are attributable to movements between the us dollar and the local currencies in countries in which the company s sales subsidiaries are located 
the company recognizes the local currency as the functional currency of its international subsidiaries 
during  the company utilized foreign currency forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a majority of its foreign currency denominated receivables in order to reduce its exposure to significant foreign currency fluctuations 
the company typically limits the duration of its foreign exchange forward contracts to days 
in december  the company expanded its foreign currency hedging program to also include foreign currency purchased option contracts in order to reduce its exposures to fluctuations in future net foreign currency cash flows 
the company s policy allows for the purchase of out of the money foreign currency purchased option contracts for up to of its risk and limits the duration of these contracts to months 
as a result  the company s hedging activities only partially address its risks in foreign currency transactions  and there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
effective january   the company elected to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company does not currently invest in contracts for speculative purposes nor does it intend to do so in the foreseeable future 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s forward and purchased option contracts and hedged positions 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of in  and at december   seven of the company s subsidiaries had available  for income tax purposes  foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  of which million expire between and the remaining  of loss carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income in the related tax jurisdictions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s income tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million compared to million at december accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of higher sales levels 
receivable days outstanding at december  was days compared to days outstanding at december  consolidated inventory balances have increased to million at december  from million at december  inventory turns of per year represent an improvement over turns of per year at december  and reflect improvements in inventory management occurring at the company s manufacturing facility in austin  texas as well as at the centralized european warehouse in amsterdam 
cash used for investing activities in includes million for the purchase of property and equipment  capitalization of software development costs of million and purchase price of million for the purchase of datalog 
the company completed an office building located next to its manufacturing facility in austin  texas in the summer of the total cost for the new building  including furniture  fixtures and equipment was million of which million was paid in out of cash generated from operations 
the company currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs created by changes in working capital from a combination of available cash and short term investment balances  internally generated funds  and financing arrangements with its current financial institutions 
the company has a million credit agreement with nationsbank of texas  na which consists of i a million revolving line of credit  and ii an million manufacturing facility loan 
as of december   the company had no outstanding balance on the line of credit and had a balance of million on the manufacturing facility loan 
the revolving line of credit expires on december  the company s credit agreements contain certain financial covenants and restrictions as to various matters  including the bank s prior approval of significant mergers and acquisitions 
borrowings under the line of credit are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s debt 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations  if any  existing cash balances and short term investments and credit available under the company s existing credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on the company s profitability  its ability to manage working capital requirements and its rate of growth 
market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
foreign currency hedging activities 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in such exchange rates on the company s earnings and cash flow 
accordingly  the company utilizes purchased foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge its exposure on anticipated transactions and firm commitments 
the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  japanese yen  german deutsche mark  french franc  italian lire and swedish krona 
the company monitors its foreign exchange exposures regularly to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
however  there can be no assurance the company s foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its results of operations and financial position 
based on the foreign exchange instruments outstanding at december   an adverse change defined as in certain asian currencies and in all other currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s financial instruments at december  and short term investments 
the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at december  was million 
the company s investment policy is to manage its investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
the company diversifies the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
based on the company s investment portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of less than  respectively  in the fair value of the investment portfolio 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the investment portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
factors affecting the company s business fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including changes in the mix of products sold  the availability and pricing of components from third parties especially sole sources  the timing of orders  level of pricing of international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates like the past devaluation in certain asian currencies  the difficulty in maintaining margins  including the higher margins traditionally achieved in international sales  and changes in pricing policies by the company  its competitors or suppliers 
specifically  if the asian currencies again weaken against the us dollar  and if the local sales prices cannot be raised  the company could experience additional deterioration of its asian profit margin 
as has occurred in the past and as may be expected to occur in the future  new software products of the company or new operating systems of third parties on which the company s products are based  often contain bugs or errors that can result in reduced sales and or cause the company s support costs to increase  either of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
furthermore  the company has significant revenues from customers in industries such as semiconductors  automated test equipment  telecommunications  aerospace  defense and automotive which are cyclical in nature 
downturns in these industries have adversely affected revenue growth in and they could continue to do so 
in recent years  the company s revenues have been characterized by seasonality  with revenues typically being relatively constant in the first  second and third quarters  growing in the fourth quarter and being relatively flat or declining from the fourth quarter of the year to the first quarter of the following year 
if this historical pattern continues  revenues for the first quarter of may not exceed revenues from the fourth quarter of the company s results of operations in the third quarter of may be adversely affected by lower sales levels in europe which typically occur during the summer months 
the company believes the seasonality of its revenue results from the international mix of its revenue and the variability of the budgeting and purchasing cycles of its customers throughout each international region 
new product introductions and market acceptance 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions  and is therefore highly dependent upon timely product innovation 
the company s success is dependent in part on its ability to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis to replace declining revenues from older products  and on increasing penetration in international markets 
in the past  the company has experienced significant delays between the announcement and the commercial availability of new products 
any significant delay in releasing new products could have a material adverse effect on the ultimate success of a product and other related products and could impede continued sales of predecessor products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to introduce new products in accordance with announced release dates  that new products will achieve market acceptance or that any such acceptance will be sustained for any significant period 
failure of new products to achieve or sustain market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s international sales will continue at existing levels or grow in accordance with the company s efforts to increase foreign market penetration 
operation in intensely competitive markets 
the markets in which the company operates are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors  and the company expects to face further competition from new market entrants in the future 
a key competitor is hewlett packard company hp  which has been the leading supplier of traditional instrumentation solutions for decades 
although hp offers its own line of instrument controllers  hp also offers hardware and software add on products for third party desktop computers and workstations that provide solutions that directly compete with the company s virtual instrumentation products 
hp is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with the company s products 
because of hp s strong position in the instrumentation business  changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company believes its ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside its control  including new product introductions by competitors  product pricing  quality and performance  success in developing new products  adequate manufacturing capacity and supply of components and materials  efficiency of manufacturing operations  effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies  strategic relationships with other suppliers  timing of new product introductions by the company  protection of the company s products by effective use of intellectual property laws  general market and economic conditions  and government actions throughout the world 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
management information systems 
during  the company implemented a contact management and technical support incident tracking system in european branches  as well as a data warehouse to aid in real time worldwide sales information analysis 
in  the company will complete implementation of the contact management and technical support incident tracking system in the three remaining european branches  the us and japan 
the company will also devote significant effort on the development of our web commerce offerings 
implementation of the new order entry  distribution and finance management information systems in europe and japan was completed in as with any information system  unforeseen issues may arise that could affect management s ability to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions 
furthermore  it is possible that one or more of the company s three regional information systems could experience a complete or partial shutdown 
if this shutdown occurred near the end of a quarter it could impact the company s product shipments and revenues as product distribution is heavily dependent on the integrated management information systems in each region 
accordingly  operating results in that quarter would be adversely impacted due to the shipments which would not occur until the following period 
the company is working to achieve reliable regional management information systems to control costs and improve the ability to deliver its products in substantially all of its direct markets worldwide 
no assurance can be given that the company s efforts will be successful 
the failure to receive adequate  accurate and timely financial information could inhibit management s ability to make effective and timely decisions 
for further information related to the management information system see the discussion of the impact of year included in this document 
risks associated with international operations and foreign economies 
international sales are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
the regulatory environment in some emerging countries is very restrictive as their governments try to protect their local economy and value of their local currency against the us dollar 
sales made by the company s direct sales offices in europe and asia pacific are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  the us dollar equivalent of these sales is affected by changes in the weighted average value of the us dollar 
this weighted average is calculated as the percentage change in the value of the currency relative to the dollar  multiplied by the proportion of international sales recorded in the particular currency 
between and this weighted average value of the us dollar increased by  causing an equivalent decrease in the us dollar value of the company s foreign currency sales and expenses 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated net sales for would have been million representing an increase of million  which represents consolidated sales growth 
if the weighted average value during had been the same as that in  the company s consolidated operating expenses would have been million  representing an increase of million  or from if the us dollar strengthens again in the future  it could have a materially adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
dependence on key suppliers 
the company s manufacturing processes use large volumes of high quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources 
several of these components are available through sole or limited sources 
sole source components purchased by the company include application specific integration circuits asics and other components 
the company has in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with sole source components  and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future 
accordingly  the failure to receive sole source components from suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on revenues and results of operations 
proprietary rights and intellectual property litigation 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary rights relative to the technologies used in its principal products 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may have in the past infringed or violated certain of the company s intellectual property rights 
as is typical in the industry  the company from time to time may be notified that it is infringing certain patent or intellectual property rights of others 
while no actions are currently pending by or against the company  there can be no assurance that litigation will not be initiated in the future which may cause significant litigation expense  liability and a diversion of management s attention which may have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
dependence on key management and technical personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of its key management  marketing  research and development and operational personnel including dr 
truchard  mr 
kodosky and other members of senior management and key technical personnel 
the company has no agreements providing for the employment of any of its key employees for any fixed term and the company s key employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the company at any time 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on operating results 
the company also believes its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled management  technical  marketing  research and development  and operational personnel with experience in managing large and rapidly changing companies as well as training  motivating and supervising the employees 
in addition  the recruiting environment for software engineering  sales and other technical professionals is very competitive 
competition for qualified software engineers is particularly intense and is likely to result in increased personnel costs 
failure to attract or retain qualified software engineers could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company also recruits and employs foreign nationals to achieve its hiring goals primarily for entry level engineering and software positions 
there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to be able to recruit foreign nationals to the current degree if government requirements for temporary and permanent residence becomes increasingly restrictive 
these factors further intensify competition for key personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in retaining its existing key personnel or attracting and retaining additional key personnel 
risk of product liability claims 
the company s products are designed in part to provide information upon which the users may rely 
the company attempts to assure the quality and accuracy of the processes contained in its products  and to limit its product liability exposure through contractual limitations on liability  including disclaimers in its shrink wrap license agreements with end users 
if future products contain errors that produce incorrect results on which users rely  customer acceptance of the company s products could be adversely affected 
further  the company could be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results or financial position 
although the company maintains liability insurance  there can be no assurance that such insurance or the contractual provisions used by the company to limit its liability will be sufficient 
impact of year like many other companies  the year computer issue creates risks for the company 
if internal systems do not correctly recognize and process date information beyond the year  there could be an adverse impact on the company s operations 
there are two other related issues which could also lead to incorrect calculations or failures i some programs assign special meaning to certain dates  such as  and ii the fact that the year is a leap year 
to address these year issues with its internal systems  the company has initiated a comprehensive program which is designed to deal with the most critical systems first 
these activities are intended to encompass all major categories of systems in use by the company  including network and communications infrastructure  manufacturing  research and development  facilities management  sales  finance and human resources 
the company s manufacturing equipment and systems are highly automated  incorporating pc s  embedded processors and related software to control activity scheduling  inventory tracking and manufacturing 
as of december  the majority of the company s critical and priority manufacturing systems and non manufacturing systems were determined to be already year capable  or replacements  changes  upgrades or workarounds have been determined and tested 
these replacements  changes and upgrades may not yet have been deployed 
the company is continuing to test  gather and produce information about its products 
certain older products will not be tested 
the company is classifying its tested products into the following categories of compliance compliant  compliant with minor issues  and not compliant 
most of the products tested are either compliant or compliant with minor issues 
if a product is stated to be non compliant  the company plans to make information available as to how an organization could avoid possible year issues regarding that product 
the company is also providing additional information and references to help other organizations test their products and applications so that end users systems are year compliant 
a year readiness disclosure statement is available at the national instruments web site 
information on the company s web site is provided to customers for the sole purpose of assisting in planning for the transition to the year no assurances can be made that problems will not arise such as customer problems with other software programs  operating systems or hardware that disrupt their use of the company s products 
there can be no assurances that such disruption would not negatively impact costs and revenues in future years 
the company is also actively working with suppliers of products and services to determine the extent to which the suppliers operations and the products and services they provide are year capable and to monitor their progress toward year capability 
highest priority is being placed on working with suppliers that are critical to the business 
the company has made inquiry of its major suppliers and to date has received written responses to its initial inquiries from of critical suppliers 
follow up activities seek to determine whether the supplier is taking all appropriate steps to fix year problems and to be prepared to continue functioning effectively as a supplier in accordance with national instruments standards and requirements 
contingency plans are being developed to address issues related to suppliers that are not considered to be making sufficient progress in becoming year capable in a timely manner 
the company is also developing contingency plans to address possible changes in customer order patterns due to year issues 
as with suppliers  the readiness of customers to deal with year issues may affect their operations and their ability to order and pay for products 
the company believes that its most likely worst case year scenarios would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than with the company s internal systems or its products 
it is clear that the company has the least ability to assess and remediate the year problems of third parties and the company believes the risks are greatest with infrastructure eg electricity supply  water and sewer service  telecommunications  transportation supply chains and critical suppliers of materials 
a worst case scenario involving a critical supplier of materials would be the partial or complete shutdown of the supplier and its resulting inability to provide critical supplies to the company on a timely basis 
the company does not maintain the capability to replace most third party supplies with internal production 
where efforts to work with critical suppliers to ensure year capability have not been successful  contingency planning generally emphasizes the identification of substitute and second source suppliers  and includes a planned increase in the level of inventory carried 
the company is not in a position to identify or to avoid all possible scenarios  however  the company is currently assessing scenarios and taking steps to mitigate the impacts of various scenarios if they were to occur 
this contingency planning will continue through as the company learns more about the preparations and vulnerabilities of third parties regarding year issues 
due to the large number of variables involved  the company cannot provide an estimate of the damage it might suffer if any of these scenarios were to occur 
in  the company commenced the replacement of its legacy information systems with a new generation of integrated applications 
since that time  the company has progressively replaced its manufacturing distribution  order entry and financial systems in the us  europe and japan 
these changes were made to improve management s control of the organization and increase operational efficiency 
this early replacement of many of the company s legacy systems has reduced the extent of the company s internal year exposure 
the company s year efforts have been undertaken almost entirely with its existing personnel 
in some instances  consultants have been engaged to provide specific guidance or services 
activities with suppliers and customers have also involved their staffs and consultants 
the company currently expects that the total cost of these programs  including both incremental spending and redeployed resources  will not exceed million 
approximately million has been spent on the programs to date 
expected year costs for manufacturing and non manufacturing internal systems in represent of the total information technology budget for no significant internal systems projects are being deferred due to the year program efforts 
the estimated costs do not include any potential costs related to customer or other claims  or potential amounts related to executing contingency plans  such as costs incurred on account of an infrastructure or supplier failure 
the company has adequate general corporate funds with which to pay for the programs expected costs 
all expected costs are based on the current assessment of the programs and are subject to change as the programs progress 
as we get closer to december   certain of the company s customers may decide to delay purchases of the company s products as part of a general restriction on new system implementations 
should a significant number of the company s customers adopt this strategy  this could have a material impact on the company s operating results 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that the year matters discussed above related to internal systems or products sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations  however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier  customer or another third party would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations 
euro conversion 
effective january   eleven of the member countries of the european union adopted a single european currency  the euro  as their common legal currency
