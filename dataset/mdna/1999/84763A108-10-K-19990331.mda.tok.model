during september and october  the company effected the sale of a total of  units of its common stock and attached warrants to the public 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock 
the company realized net cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale 
on march   the company executed an agreement with a private investor the equity line agreement which provides for the company  at its sole discretion  subject to certain restrictions  to sell put to the investor up to million of its common stock 
the equity line agreement expires in august and  among other things  provides for minimum and maximum puts ranging from  to million  depending on the company s stock price and trading volume

the preferred stock in the second tranche will contain terms and conditions for conversion similar to the first tranche  except that the fixed conversion price will be set at of the average market price of the common stock at the time of the second closing

in comparison  at december   the company had working capital of approximately million which included cash and cash equivalents of approximately million of which approximately million was restricted and short term investments of approximately million 
the million decrease in working capital is attributable primarily to the funding of the million operating loss for the year ended december   offset in part by a borrowing collateralized by equipment million and equity transactions  principally utilization of the equity line agreement  of approximately million 
through december   the company spent principally in approximately million for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of which million was borrowed from a finance company pursuant to a million equipment line of credit agreement 
in  the company intends to spend approximately million for additional equipment as it further expands its research and development laboratories  and to partially finance these capital equipment acquisitions by utilizing the  remaining under its existing equipment line of credit agreement 
the company has pledged substantially all of its tangible assets as collateral for this borrowing 
the company has also granted to the finance company a warrant to purchase up to  shares of its common stock at a share 
effective june the company entered into a non cancelable long term operating lease with a major developer 
the initial lease term is seven years with two renewal options for five years each at the then fair market value rate 
minimum rental commitments under this lease for the five and one half year period from january through june are approximately    and     and  
in addition to rentals  the company is obligated under the lease for real property taxes  insurance and maintenance 
in october the company entered into an agreement with a contract research organization to conduct a clinical trial in three countries involving approximately patients 
the agreement  which is cancelable by either party upon thirty days notice  is expected to result in aggregate expenditures ranging from to million over the course of one year 
through december   the company had expended approximately  in connection with this clinical trial  of which approximately  was reflected as an advance at december   for services to be rendered in the company has committed to spend approximately  in and  in to a number of universities to conduct general scientific research programs and to provide for fellowship grants 
since its inception  the company has been in the development stage and therefore devotes substantially all of its efforts to research and development 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of approximately million through december   and expects to incur substantial losses over the next several years 
the company s future capital requirements and availability of capital will depend upon many factors  including continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  the cost of commercialization activities and other factors which may not be within the company s control 
while the company believes that its existing capital resources will be adequate to fund its capital needs for at least months of operations  the company also believes that ultimately it will require substantial additional funds in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize its proposed products 
if the company is successful in obtaining additional funding  the company s existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution to their shares of stock 
without additional funding  the company may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of its research and development projects  or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others which may require the company to relinquish rights to certain technologies  product candidates or products that the company would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on its own  and which could be on terms unfavorable to the company 
year readiness disclosure all statements contained in the following section are year readiness disclosures within the meaning of the year information and disclosure act 
the year issue the year issue in computers arises from the common industry practice of using two digits to represent a date in computer software code and databases to enhance both processing time and save storage space 
therefore  when dates in the year and beyond are indicated and computer programs read the date  the computer may default to the year rather than the correct this could result in incorrect calculations  faulty data and computer shutdowns  which would cause disruptions of operations 
in addition  the year is a leap year and systems need to recognize it as such 
the company has developed a multi phase program for year issues that consists of the following i assessment of the corporate systems and operations of the company that could be affected by the year issue  ii remediation of non compliant systems and components  if any  and iii testing of systems and components following remediation 
the company has focused its year compliance assessment program on four principal areas a the company s internal information technology system applications  including voice and data systems it systems  b the company s internal non it facilities systems  including embedded software in environmental controls  security systems  fire protection systems  elevators and public utility connections for gas  electric and telephone systems facilities systems  c embedded and external software contained in laboratory and other equipment equipment  and d year compliance by third parties with which the company has a material relationship  such as significant vendors  financial institutions and insurers 
the company has completed an inventory and risk assessment of its own internal it systems  facilities systems  and equipment that it believes could be adversely affected by the year issue  and believes that its own internal systems are  at the present time  substantially compliant based upon internal systems tests  currently available information and reasonable assurance by its equipment and software vendors 
the cost to remediate the year issues with regard to the company s it and facility systems and equipment is not material 
in june of  the company began sending questionnaires to and or contacting its outside vendors regarding their state of readiness with respect to identifying and remediating their year issues 
the company has completed its risk assessment of its outside vendors and is currently reviewing their compliance 
it is not possible for the company to determine or be assured that adequate remediation of the year issue will be accomplished by such vendors 
furthermore  it is not possible for the company to determine or be assured that third parties upon which the company s vendors are dependent  will accomplish adequate remediation of their year issues 
except for the company s public utility service vendors  who have indicated that they expect to be in compliance by mid  the company believes that  with respect to the computer systems of its major outside vendors  should a year issue exist whereby a vendor was unable to address the company s needs  alternative vendors have been identified and are readily available that could furnish the company with the same or similar supplies or services that it presently receives from these vendors without undue cost or expense 
based on currently available information  the company believes that the impact of the year issue  as it relates to its it systems  facilities systems  equipment and third parties will not be material 
in the event the company were to fail to successfully implement its solutions to the year issues with respect to its internal systems in a timely manner  the company believes that while such events would be disruptive to the company s operations in the short term  such circumstances would not have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company over the long term 
however  failure of the major third parties  in particular the financial institutions with which the company has significant banking and investment management relationships and the company s third party manufacturers  to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations or business prospects
