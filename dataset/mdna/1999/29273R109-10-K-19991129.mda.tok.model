item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the historical financial condition and results of operations of heritage and the partnership should be read in conjunction with the selected historical financial and operating data and notes thereto  and the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
general since its formation in  heritage has grown primarily through acquisitions of retail propane operations and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
through august   heritage and the partnership completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the partnership has completed of these acquisitions since going public on june  the partnership engages in the sale  distribution and marketing of propane and other related products 
the partnership derives its revenue primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
the general partner believes that the partnership is one of the largest retail marketers of propane in the united states  based on retail gallons sold  serving more than  residential  industrial commercial and agricultural customers in states through retail outlets 
annual retail propane sales volumes in gallons were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  tobacco curing  poultry brooding and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel that burns in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating source in manufacturing and mining processes 
the retail propane distribution business is largely seasonal due to propane s use as a heating source in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of the partnership s retail propane volume and in excess of percent of the partnership s ebitda is attributable to sales during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in the partnership s first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flow from operations  however  is generally greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the six month peak heating season 
a substantial portion of the partnership s propane is used in the heating sensitive residential and commercial markets causing the temperatures realized in the partnership s areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  to have a significant effect on the financial performance of the partnership 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
the partnership therefore uses information on normal temperatures in understanding how temperatures that are colder or warmer than normal affect historical results of operations and in preparing forecasts of future operations  which assumes that normal weather will prevail in each of the partnership s regions 
the retail propane business is a margin based business in which gross profits depend on the excess of sales price over propane supply costs 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which the partnership will have no control 
product supply contracts are one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the wholesale cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce the partnership s gross profits 
in the past  the partnership generally attempted to reduce price risk by purchasing propane on a short term basis 
the partnership has on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its service centers and in major storage facilities for future resale 
gross profit margins vary according to customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher margins than sales to certain other customer groups  such as agricultural customers 
wholesale margins are substantially lower than retail margins 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographical region 
accordingly  a change in customer or geographic mix can affect gross profit without necessarily affecting total revenues 
analysis of historical results of operations the following discussion reflects for the periods indicated the results of operations and operating data for the partnership 
most of the increases in the line items discussed below result from the acquisitions made by the partnership during the periods discussed 
in fiscal  the partnership consummated six acquisitions for a total purchase price of million 
in fiscal and  the partnership consummated seven acquisitions in each of the years for total purchase prices of million and million  respectively 
these acquisitions affect the comparability of prior period financial matters  as the volumes are not included in the prior period s results of operations 
amounts discussed below reflect percent of the results of m p energy partnership  formerly named m p oils partnership  a general partnership in which the partnership owns a percent interest 
because m p energy partnership is primarily engaged in lower margin wholesale distribution  its contribution to the partnership s net income is not significant and the minority interest of this partnership is excluded from the ebitda calculation 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year volume 
the partnership sold million retail gallons  an increase of million gallons or from the million gallons sold in fiscal primarily as a result of acquisitions 
the increases in the partnership s volumes were net of the effects of one of the warmest winters this century 
the partnership also sold approximately million wholesale gallons during fiscal  a decrease of million gallons from fiscal s million gallons 
the decrease in the wholesale volumes was attributable to a decline of million gallons in the foreign operations of m p energy partnership and the decline of million gallons in the us wholesale operations 
the warm weather experienced by the partnership this past heating season was the main factor in the decline in these volumes 
revenues 
total revenues for the partnership decreased million to million from last year s total revenues of million 
retail fuel revenues increased million to million while domestic wholesale fuel revenues decreased million and foreign wholesale revenues decreased million 
the increase in retail fuel revenues due to increased volumes was partially offset by the effects of lower cost of fuel this fiscal year 
the decreases in the us and foreign wholesale revenues correspond primarily to the decrease in volumes 
other revenues increased million primarily as a result of acquisitions and to a lesser extent internal growth 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales decreased million  or to million for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to million for fiscal year ended august  domestic cost of sales decreased million  or to million and foreign cost of sales decreased million  or to million 
retail fuel cost of sales decreased million to in fiscal due to the lower cost of propane realized in which offset the increase in volumes 
domestic wholesale and foreign cost of sales both decreased due to the lower cost of fuel realized in fiscal and the decrease in volumes 
gross profit 
total gross profit for fiscal was million  a million increase or over fiscal s gross profit of million 
the reduction in the cost of fuel this fiscal year was the primary contributing factor in the increase in gross profit along with the increase in other revenues 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for fiscal increased million or to million as compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily the result of increased costs related to acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased 
million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase is the result of additional expenses to support business growth 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was million for fiscal  a million increase over fiscal s million 
this increase is the result of additional depreciation and amortization costs on the fixed assets and intangibles recorded in relation to acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income increased to million in fiscal  a million increase over fiscal s million 
the increased gross profit described above offset by the increases in operating and other expenses  also described above  resulted in this increase 
net income 
net income for the fiscal year ended august   increased 
million  or to million as compared to fiscal s net income of million 
this increase is the result of increased operating income partially offset by increased interest costs related to acquisition debt 
ebitda 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization increased million or to million for fiscal as compared to the restated ebitda of million 
fiscal s ebitda was restated to account for the non cash compensation expense that was previously included 
the partnership s ebitda includes the ebitda of investees  but does not include the ebitda of the minority interest of m p energy partnership 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligation  but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year volume 
the partnership sold million retail gallons  an increase of million gallons or from the million gallons sold in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to acquisition related volumes offset  to a certain extent  by the effects of the warmer weather pattern of el nino 
the partnership also sold approximately million wholesale gallons during fiscal  a decrease of million wholesale gallons or from the million wholesale gallons sold in fiscal the decrease in wholesale volumes was attributable to a decline of million gallons in the foreign operations of m p energy partnership and million gallons in us wholesale operations  both primarily due to warmer than normal weather in those areas of operations 
revenues 
total revenues decreased million or to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal domestic retail fuel revenues increased million or in fiscal to million  as compared to million for fiscal us wholesale fuel revenues decreased million or from million reported in fiscal foreign fuel revenues decreased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in us and foreign wholesale fuel revenues was attributable to both decreased volumes and sales prices 
the increase in domestic retail fuel revenues resulted from increased volumes and offset somewhat by decreased sales prices 
other revenues increased million primarily as a result of acquisitions and to a lesser extent internal growth 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to fiscal s million 
domestic cost of sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal foreign cost of sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in foreign cost of sales was attributable to decreased volumes sold and a decrease in the cost per gallon of propane 
the decrease in domestic cost of sales was also due to a decrease in the cost per gallon of propane and the decrease in domestic wholesale volumes for fiscal  offset by the increased volumes of retail fuel 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased million or to million in fiscal as  compared to million in fiscal this increase was attributable to the acquisition related increase in retail volumes sold  the impact of higher margins and an increase in other propane related gross profit 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million or to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal a slight increase as compared to million in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased approximately million or to million in fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of additional depreciation and amortization associated with acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income increased million or to million in fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase was the result of the increase in gross profit offset by the acquisition related increase in operating expenses and depreciation and amortization 
net income 
net income increased million or to million in fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal this increase is due to higher operating income for fiscal as compared to  offset partially by increased interest costs in fiscal ebitda 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for fiscal was million  as restated to account for non cash compensation expense  an increase of million or over fiscal s ebitda of million 
increased gross profit for fiscal  offset by the acquisition related increase in operating expenses attributed to the increase in ebitda 
the partnership s ebitda includes the ebitda of investees  but does not include the ebitda of the minority interest of m p energy partnership 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to service debt obligation  but provides additional information for evaluating the partnership s ability to make the minimum quarterly distribution 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of the partnership to satisfy its obligations will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
future capital needs of the partnership are expected to be provided by various sources as follows a increases in working capital will be financed by the working capital line of credit and repaid from subsequent seasonal reductions in inventory and accounts receivable b payment of interest cost  and other debt services  will be provided by the annual cash flow from operations c required maintenance capital  predominantly vehicle replacement  will also be provided by the annual cash flow from operations d growth capital  mainly for customer tanks  expended will be financed by the revolving acquisition bank line of credit e acquisition capital expenditures will be financed with additional indebtedness on the revolving acquisition bank line of credit  other lines of credit  issues of additional common units or a combination thereof 
cash flows operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  was million compared to million in fiscal the cash flows from operations for fiscal consisted primarily of net income of million and noncash charges of million  principally depreciation and amortization 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal included capital expenditures for acquisitions amounting to million  net of cash received plus million spent for maintenance needed to sustain operations at current levels  customer tanks to support growth of operations  the purchase of land previously under lease arrangements and other miscellaneous capitalized items 
these investing activities were offset by proceeds from asset sales of million  which was principally from the non recurring sale of certain idle property 
the proceeds from asset sales were used to purchase property in certain areas of the partnership s operations that were previously leased and fund purchases of capital assets used in the business 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal of million is primarily the result of an increase in the working capital facility of million and a net increase in long term debt of million to fund acquisitions 
these increases were offset by cash distributions to unitholders of million 
financing and sources of liquidity the partnership has a bank credit facility  which includes a working capital facility  a revolving credit facility providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for working capital and other general partnership purposes  and an acquisition facility  a revolving credit facility providing for up to million of borrowings to be used for acquisitions and improvements 
see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements working capital facilities and long term debt 
on october   the partnership used the net proceeds of million from a public offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the acquisition facility that was incurred to acquire propane businesses 
see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements registration statements 
the partnership uses its cash provided by operating and financing activities to provide distributions to unitholders and to fund acquisition  maintenance and growth capital expenditures 
acquisition capital expenditures  which include expenditures related to the acquisition of retail propane operations and intangibles associated with such acquired businesses  were million for fiscal year  as compared to million during fiscal in addition to the million of cash expended for acquisitions during fiscal  
million of common units and million for notes payable on non compete agreements were issued in connection with certain acquisitions 
the partnership increased its distribution to unitholders two times during the past fiscal year to a current annual level of per unit 
under the partnership agreement of heritage  the partnership will distribute to its partners  days after the end of each fiscal quarter  an amount equal to all of its available cash for such quarter 
available cash generally means  with respect to any quarter of the partnership  all cash on hand at the end of such quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion that is necessary or appropriate to provide for future cash requirements 
the partnership s commitment to its unitholders is to distribute the increase in its cash flow while maintaining prudent reserves for the partnership s operations 
the decision to increase the quarterly distribution resulted from a review of heritage s past financial performance and current projections for available cash 
the current distribution level includes incentive distributions payable to the general partner to the extent the quarterly distribution exceeds 
per unit annually 
the assets utilized in the propane business do not typically require lengthy manufacturing process time nor complicated  high technology components 
accordingly  the partnership does not have any significant financial commitments for capital expenditures 
in addition  the partnership has not experienced any significant increases attributable to inflation in the cost of these assets or in its operations 
description of indebtedness the operating partnership assumed million principal amount of senior secured notes the notes at the formation of the partnership in a private placement with institutional investors 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on each december and june the notes have a final maturity of years  with ten equal mandatory repayments of principal beginning on june  see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements working capital facilities and long term debt 
on november   the partnership entered into a note purchase agreement medium term note program  that provides for the issuance of up to million of senior secured promissory notes if certain conditions are met 
an initial placement of million series a and b at an average interest rate of with an average year maturity was completed at the closing of the medium term note program 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on each november and may an additional placement of million series c  d and e at an average interest rate of with an average year maturity was completed in march interest is payable on series c  d and e semi annually in arrears on each september and march the proceeds of the placements were used to refinance amounts outstanding under the acquisition facility 
see page f  notes to consolidated financial statements working capital facilities and long term debt 
the note purchase agreement  medium term note program and bank credit agreement contain customary restrictive covenants applicable to the operating partnership including limitations on the level of additional indebtedness  creation of liens and sale of assets 
in addition  the operating partnership must maintain certain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda and consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense 
these agreements also provide that the operating partnership may declare  make or incur a liability to make a restricted payment during each fiscal quarter  if a the amount of such restricted payment  together with all other restricted payments during such quarter  do not exceed available cash with respect to the immediately preceding quarter  and b no default or event of default exists before such restricted payment and after giving effect thereto 
the agreements provide that cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to of the interest to be paid on the notes 
in addition  in the third  second and first quarters preceding a quarter in which a scheduled principal payment is to be made on the notes  available cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to  and  respectively  of the principal amount to be repaid on such payment dates 
the operating partnership is in compliance with all requirements  tests  limitations and covenants related to the notes and bank credit facility 
year matters the year issue arose because many computer programs use only the last two digits to indicate the year  hence  they may not correctly interpret dates beyond the year the partnership has recognized the potential impact of this problem that could cause computer applications to fail or create erroneous results disrupting business operations 
the partnership along with outside consultants has conducted a detailed assessment of its year yk compliance and readiness issues 
the partnership has put a comprehensive program in place to prepare for its yk readiness and designates the following information as our year readiness disclosure 
the scope of the partnership s program includes the review and evaluation of its information technology it such as hardware and software utilized in the partnership s operations  non it systems or embedded technology such as micro controllers contained in various equipment  facilities and vehicles  and the readiness of third parties which includes key fuel suppliers  vendors and banking facilities 
a complete and detailed inventory list of the partnership s hardware and software systems has been completed enabling us to evaluate the state of readiness of these systems 
the partnership s district operations use a variety of external software that has been evaluated for year compliance 
the upgrade to the yk software at these district locations is complete 
the hardware necessary to accommodate the software upgrades was replaced as needed 
the partnership s central accounting software  which encompasses general ledger  financial reporting  and accounts payable  has been upgraded and successfully tested as yk compliant 
the partnership s payroll  fixed asset and wholesale fuel supply and distribution systems are completed 
miscellaneous applications have also been evaluated and upgrades are completed 
the non it systems such as telephones  fax machines  and photocopiers were investigated for the date critical year and were replaced or updated as needed for operation 
the partnership has identified major vendors and suppliers on whom it depends upon for services and products to assess their year readiness to assure there are no interruptions in operations 
a year compliance letter and questionnaire was sent to these third parties and our evaluation of these key third parties is complete 
while none of the partnership s products are directly date sensitive  interruption of the supply and delivery of gas products or other services could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the partnership 
by contacting these third parties to assess their state of readiness and developing an appropriate contingency plan if necessary  the partnership is hoping to minimize these risks 
the partnership contacted their bank facilities to ensure that the collection and transfer of funds will not be interrupted and that extension of working capital will be available as needed 
the partnership does not have any customers that accounted for or more of the partnership s revenues during fiscal thus reducing the risk if some but not all customers are not yk compliant 
estimated costs to modify its computer based systems to date have not been specifically tracked but are estimated to be immaterial 
a portion of these costs was capitalized as they relate to adding new software and hardware to enhance current operations 
other costs related directly to becoming year compliant have been expensed as incurred 
a contingency plan has been developed to deal with system failures and disruptions of service arising from third party yk failures 
the contingency plan for the partnership s district operations is primarily focused on one system that already has been successfully tested and is yk compliant 
this system affects two thirds of our district operations and if other systems fail during the testing  they will be upgraded to this compliant system 
the success the partnership has with dealing with the issues of the year and its vendor and supplier s success in the matter will affect the partnership s future operations 
interruptions in the partnership s operations or those of its major suppliers and vendors due to year failures could have a material adverse affect on its operations and cash flows 
in addition to the business risks noted above there are other yk risks  which include but are not limited to utility and telecommunication systems failure to provide service  which are beyond the partnership s control and could have adverse effects on our operations 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  excluding historical information  include certain forward looking statements 
although heritage believes such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  no assurance can be given that every objective will be reached 
such statements are made in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of as required by that law  the partnership hereby identifies the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted by the partnership in forward looking statements 
o risks and uncertainties impacting the partnership as a whole relate to changes in general economic conditions in the united states  the availability and cost of capital  changes in laws and regulations to which the partnership is subject  including tax  environmental and employment laws and regulations  the cost and effects of legal and administrative claims and proceedings against the partnership or which may be brought against the partnership and changes in general and economic conditions and currencies in foreign countries 
o the uncertainty of the ability of the partnership to sustain its rate of internal sales growth and its ability to locate and acquire other propane companies at prices that are accretive to the partnership 
o risks and uncertainties related to energy prices and the ability of the partnership to develop expanded markets and products offerings as well as their ability to maintain existing markets 
in addition  future sales will depend on the cost of propane compared to other fuels  competition from other propane retailers and alternate fuels  the general level of petroleum product demand  and weather conditions  among other things 
o the partnership s success in dealing with the year issues and those of its vendors  suppliers and other third parties  many of which are beyond the partnership s control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership has very little cash flow exposure due to rate changes for long term debt obligations 
the partnership primarily enters debt obligations to support general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the partnership s long term debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt obligations mature  the partnership may refinance all or a portion of such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
commodity price risk arises from the risk of price changes in the propane inventory that the partnership buys and sells 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which the partnership will have no control 
in the past  price changes have generally been passed along to the partnership s customers to maintain gross margins  mitigating the commodity price risk 
the partnership in the past has on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at its service centers and in major storage facilities
