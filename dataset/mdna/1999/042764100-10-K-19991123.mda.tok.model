during fiscal  and  the percentage of the company s sales invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar was  and  respectively 
in addition  a small part of the company s cost of goods sold is denominated in foreign currencies 
as a partial hedge against these foreign currency risk exposures  the company periodically enters into foreign currency exchange contracts with certain major financial institutions 
by their nature  all such contracts involve risk  including the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
accordingly  losses relating to these contracts could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
based upon the company s knowledge of the financial condition of the counterparties to its existing forward contracts  the company believes that it does not have any material exposure to any individual counterparty

operations of the company are also exposed to  in the normal course of business  fluctuations in interest rates 
this interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term us dollar interest rates

the interest rate swap agreement exchanges floating rate for fixed interest payments over the year life of the agreement 
based on the company s assessment of the interest rate environment  the company exercised its right to terminate the agreement in august the company s exposure to credit risk consists principally of trade receivables 
hospitals and international dealers account for a substantial portion of trade receivables and collateral is generally not required 
the company believes that its risk associated with this concentration is limited due to the company s on going credit review procedures 
based upon its present plans  the company believes that its working capital  operating cash flow and available credit sources will be adequate to repay current portions of long term debt  to finance currently planned capital expenditures and to meet the currently foreseeable liquidity needs of the company 
during the periods discussed above  the overall effects of inflation and seasonality on the company s business were not significant

early in  the company responded to the fda concerning the effect of the year problem on its intra aortic balloon pumps 
the software in the more recent models of the pumps has taken the change of century issues into account 
the operating range for the clock calendar in these pumps spans a year period from the years through the clock calendar on certain older models advances as high as however  none of the pumps depend on the year information for any calculations or in year readiness continued communicating with other electronic devices  and all of these pumps will function as intended or expected  regardless of the date 
specific pump model numbers that have or do not have the updated clock calendars are listed on the company s web site 
the left ventricular assist system and hemodynamic monitor  the hemosonic  were designed to be year compliant 
the company s major year concerns relate to business systems that support the continuity of its business operations and the delivery of products and support services to its customers 
for the company s business applications relating to sales order processing  billing  disbursements  payroll  marketing  manufacturing management  and general ledger  the necessary software code modifications have been completed in the development version of the applications 
modified versions were tested by advancing dates beyond december  the year validated software was moved to the production machines 
the cost of the company s software upgrades was approximately million for all us systems and million for all foreign systems 
internal resources devoted to these efforts were man days 
in the event that the us production systems malfunction due to the change to the year  the software and data will be moved back to the machines on which the validation was done so that business processes can continue 
the company s engineering documentation systems which are critical systems for engineering and manufacturing were tested and are believed to be year compliant 
internal resources devoted to upgrading these systems were in excess of man days

the company s computer controlled equipment includes programmable controllers on production equipment and systems for time and attendance recording  building management  life safety  security  elevators  air compressors and high purity water 
for equipment or systems controlled by computer chips or programs  the company has determined that these systems or equipment are year compliant 
final testing has begun in all of the company s manufacturing locations 
the status of year compliance by key suppliers of products and services to the company was determined by using a compliance survey 
critical suppliers have plans underway to assure their readiness for the year the company has increased production by to help ensure that sufficient inventories are available for the year in addition  the company has adopted a policy to discourage excessive stockpiling of company products by customers 
finally  the company s unused credit facilities will provide additional borrowing capacity which could be utilized to support the company s cash flow requirements in the event that health care providers are unable to pay amounts owed to the company on a timely basis due to system malfunctions related to the year change 
the company believes that any significant adverse year effects will arise from circumstances beyond its control 
in addition  the company believes that its united states operations can compensate for any short term  isolated year failures that may affect the company s non us operations 
while the company believes that it is adequately addressing the year problem  there can be no assurance that the costs and liabilities of the year problem will not materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
european union conversion to euro the company proactively considered issues related to conversion by eleven member states of the european union to a common currency  the euro  beginning on january  for business applications relating to sales order processing  billing and payments  the company has completed the necessary software code modification to address the triangulation requirements of the conversion 
the cost of such modifications was approximately million 
pricing of the company s products in the european union generally is market driven 
as such  the euro conversion did not have any impact on product pricing or contractual arrangements with health care service providers 
recent development on september   the company completed the previously announced acquisition of sometec  sa for million  a french development company that has recently introduced a non invasive esophageal ultrasound probe that continuously measures descending aortic blood flow

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk due to the global nature of its operations  the company is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
such exposures arise from transactions denominated in foreign currencies  primarily from translation of results of operations from outside the united states  intercompany loans  and intercompany purchases of inventory 
the company is also exposed to interest rate changes 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated foreign currency revenues to meet these objectives 
the principal currencies hedged are the japanese yen and major european currencies 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent true exposures exist 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
the fair value of all foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at august  was million  which does not represent the company s annual exposure 
an analysis was prepared to estimate the sensitivity of the fair value of all foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hypothetical favorable and unfavorable changes in spot exchange rates at august  the results of this estimation  which may vary from actual results  are as follows item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk continued fair value of foreign currency in millions forward exchange contracts adverse rate movement at august  rates
