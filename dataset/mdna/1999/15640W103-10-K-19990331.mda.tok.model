item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  as well as risk factors included in this annual report on form k 
overview the company commenced operations in and provides a suite of products application developers use to build and deploy business applications in a cost effective manner 
centura products include an embeddable and secure databases that scale from micro database environments to the web  and object oriented and web based application development tools 
the company s product lines include a secure embeddable database  sqlbase  application and web based development tools  centura team developer  the bit version of sqlwindows  and centura net 
db and pc to mainframe connectivity products sqlhost 
these products are expected to constitute the majority of the company s net revenues for the foreseeable future see recent developments below  also see note subsequent events  to the consolidated financial statements 
any failure to deliver products as scheduled  or such products failure to achieve early market acceptance  could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition of the company

the company reported a profit of million for fiscal year  a loss of million for  and a profit of million for beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company refocused and restructured its operations to leverage its core technological competencies into next generation products  which include embeddable databases and web based development tools 
the company continues to embrace object oriented application development 
with the addition of centura net 
db  the company s products now provide a comprehensive architecture for the development and deployment of information systems and applications from a host environment  through two tier client server and sql databases  to the multi tier environment of the world wide web 
the company has experienced in the past and may in the future continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
many of the company s product licensing arrangements are subject to revenue recognition on a per unit deployed basis as the company s deferred obligation to its customers is gradually extinguished 
revenue recognition in such cases is therefore dependent upon the business activities of the company s customers and the timely and accurate reporting of such activities to the company  which makes predictability of the related revenue extremely uncertain 
although the company has operated historically with little or no backlog of traditional boxed product shipments  it has experienced a seasonal pattern of product revenue decline between the fourth quarter and the succeeding first quarter  contributing to lower worldwide product revenues and operating results during such quarters 
it has generally realized lower european product revenues in the third quarter as compared to the rest of the year 
the company has also experienced a pattern of recording a substantial portion of its revenues in the third month of a quarter 
as a result  product revenues in any quarter are dependent on orders booked in the last month 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in sales of the company s products in relation to the company s expectations could have an immediate adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that the company s operating results may  during any fiscal period  fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors

other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is comprised of interest income  interest expense  valuation of warrants  and gains or losses on foreign currency transactions 
the company s gains or losses from foreign currency transactions have fluctuated from period to period  primarily as a result of fluctuating values of the us dollar and instability in european and latin american currency markets 
the company recorded a foreign currency loss of approximately million in  principally due to the decline in the value of certain european currencies 
the company recorded a foreign currency loss of million in and a gain of million in the costs of currency hedging are reflected in the reported gains and losses of foreign currency transactions 
the company anticipates that it will continue to hedge foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities in nonetheless  a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar could result in losses from foreign currency transactions 
the company s net interest expense was million  million and million in  and respectively 
included in other income and expense in are non cash charges of approximately million associated with the issuance of warrants 
the warrants were valued using an independent appraiser  and a modified black scholes model 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
sales of the company s products are denominated both in local currencies of the respective geographic region and in us dollars  depending upon the economic stability of that region and locally accepted business practices 
accordingly  any increase in the value of the us dollar relative to local currencies in these markets may negatively impact revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
an increase in the relative value of the us dollar would serve to increase the relative foreign currency cost to the customer of a us dollar denominated purchase  which may negatively affect the company s sales in those markets 
the us dollar value of a sale denominated in a region s local currency decreases in proportion to relative increases in the value of the us dollar 
provision for income taxes

as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future federal taxable income and million available to offset future state taxes  which expire through the availability and timing of these loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited due to the occurrence of certain events  including certain changes in ownership interests 
at december   and  the company fully reserved its deferred tax assets due to the existence of uncertainty of the company s ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
the company s international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations  including changes in specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and natural disasters 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its sales commitments  anticipated sales and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as the interest rate risk inherent in the company s foreign receivable portfolio 
the company s risk management strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposure 
the company believes that the adverse movements in foreign exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and underlying exposures described above would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
annual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis  however  based on the changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate movements and the company s actual exposures and hedges 
at december   the company had  in day forward contracts denominated in four european currencies  german deutsche marks  british pounds sterling  netherland guilders  and italian lire  as well as the australian dollar 
the carrying value of these financial instruments approximate their respective fair values 
at december   the company s investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents  and is therefore  subject to no interest rate risk 
in january  the company entered into a  asset based loan facility with coast business credit  the facility 
the loan provides borrowings of up to  secured by the company s accounts receivable  combined with a  capital equipment facility 
the facility bears interest at above the bank of america reference rate  and provides for the ability to reduce interest cost based on the achievement of certain financial covenants 
the facility also requires that the company maintain a minimum net worth of negative million 
the facility matures in january and provides for the ability to extend the agreement for one year at the option of the company 
the facility replaces an accounts receivable factoring agreement entered into by the company in june as of december  there was  drawn against the  loan facility  and having achieved certain financial covenants  the company was paying an interest rate of above the bank of america reference rate 
although the facility is subject to interest rate risk  the company believes that the adverse movements of interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
year issue 
background 
some computers  software  and other equipment include programming code in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
as a result of this design decision  some of these systems could fail to operate or fail to produce correct results if is interpreted to mean  rather than these problems are widely expected to increase in frequency and severity as the year approaches  and are commonly referred to as the millennium bug or year problem 
assessment 
the year problem could affect computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company 
accordingly  the company is reviewing its internal computer programs and systems to ensure that the programs and systems will be year compliant 
the company presently believes that its computer systems will be year compliant in a timely manner 
however  while the estimated cost of these efforts is not expected to be material to the company s financial position or any year s results of operations  there can be no assurance to this effect 
software sold to consumers 
all current products developed by the company are designed to record  store and process and present calendar dates occurring on or after january  with the same degree of accuracy that such products process dates occurring before such date 
internal infrastructure 
the company believes that it has identified substantially all of the major computers  software applications  and related equipment used in connection with its internal operations that must be modified  upgraded  or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to its business 
the company has commenced the process of modifying  upgrading  and replacing major systems that have been identified as adversely affected  and expects to complete this process in a timely manner 
systems other than information technology systems 
in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  photocopiers  telephone switches  security systems  and other common devices may be affected by the year problem 
the company is currently assessing the potential effect of  and costs of remediating  the year problem on its office and facilities equipment 
the company estimates the total cost to the company of completing any required modifications  upgrades  or replacements of these internal systems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
this estimate is being monitored and will be revised as additional information becomes available 
suppliers 
the company has initiated communications with third party suppliers of the major computers  software  and other equipment used  operated  or maintained by the company to identify and  to the extent possible  to resolve issues involving the year problem 
however  the company has limited or no control over the actions of these third party suppliers 
thus  while the company expects that it will be able to resolve any significant year problems with these systems  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will resolve any or all year problems with these systems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the business of the company or any of its customers 
any failure of these third parties to resolve year problems with their systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operation 
disclaimer 
management believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting the company have been identified or corrected 
the number of devices that could be affected and the interactions among these devices are simply too numerous 
in addition  one cannot accurately predict how many year problem related failures will occur  or the severity  duration  or financial consequences of these perhaps inevitable failures 
the discussion of the company s efforts  and management s expectations  relating to year compliance are forward looking statements 
the company s ability to achieve year compliance and the level of incremental costs associated therewith  could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  vendors ability to modify proprietary software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review 
while the company has begun the implementation of year related upgrades appropriate for the company s internal systems and equipment and year compliance issues in the systems of customers  vendors and other related parties  there can be no assurance that problems will not arise as a result of the year issue 
inflation 
the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on the company s operating results and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on the company s operating results in recent accounting pronouncements 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop provides guidance on capitalization of the costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
it also provides guidance for determining whether computer software is internal use software and on accounting for the proceeds of computer software originally developed or obtained for internal use and then subsequently sold to the public 
the company has not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this statement 
the disclosures prescribed by sop will be effective for the company s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending december in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments  embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
the company will adopt sfas in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending december  and has not yet evaluated the impact of adoption and its effects on the company s results of operations  financial position  capital resources or liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had a working capital position of approximately million and net shareholders equity of approximately million

the company may  however  choose to raise cash for operational or other needs sometime in the future 
if the company needs further financing  there can be no assurance that it will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any additional equity financing will result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
the company s capital requirements also may be affected by acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to the company s business  which the company considers from time to time 
the company regularly evaluates such opportunities 
any such transaction  if consummated  may further reduce the company s working capital or require the issuance of the company s common stock

see part i  item i 
dilutive and potential dilutive effect to shareholders 
factors that may affect future results the company has experienced in the past and expects in the future to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
the company has at times recognized a substantial portion of its net revenues in the last month or last few weeks of a quarter 
the company generally ships products as orders are received and  therefore  has little or no backlog 
as a result  quarterly sales and operating results generally depend on a number of factors that are difficult to forecast  including  among others  the volume and timing of and ability to fulfill orders received within the quarter 
operating results also may fluctuate due to factors such as demand for the company s products  introduction  localization or enhancement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products  reviews in the industry press concerning the products of the company or its competitors  changes or anticipated changes in pricing by the company or its competitors  mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  mix of products sold  returns from the company s distributors and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
in addition  because the company s staffing and other operating expenses are based in part on anticipated net revenues  a substantial portion of which may not be generated until the end of each quarter  delays in the receipt or shipment of orders and ability to achieve anticipated revenue levels can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in sales of the company s products in relation to the company s expectations could have an immediate adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company currently intends to increase its operating expenses to fund greater levels of sales and marketing operations and expand distribution channels 
to the extent that such expenses proceed or are not subsequently followed by increased net revenues  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in the future  the company may make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
managing acquired businesses entails numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  diversion of management s attention to other business concerns  amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively complete or integrate acquisitions  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
as of the date hereof  the company has no understanding or agreement with any other entity regarding any potential acquisition or combination  the consummation of which is probable 
in addition  quarterly operating results of the company will depend on a number of other factors that are difficult to forecast  including factors listed in item business  risk factors recent company losses  fluctuations in quarterly results
