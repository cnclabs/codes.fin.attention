item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding future events or our future financial performance that involve certain risks and uncertainties including those discussed in risk factors at pages to of this annual report on form k 
actual events or actual future results may differ materially from any forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties 
results of operations comparison of fiscal to change net revenues   we derive revenues primarily from shipments of entertainment software  which includes ea studio cd products for dedicated entertainment systems cd video games  ea studio cd personal computer products pc cd  ea studio cartridge products and affiliated label al products that are published by third parties and distributed by us 
we also derive revenues from licensing of ea studio products and al products through hardware companies oems and online subscription revenues 
our total net revenues increased compared to the prior year due to increased sales of products on playstation  nintendo n  pc cd and increased worldwide distribution of al products 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of sega saturn r products and bit video game products 
sales of playstation products in fiscal increased to  or of total revenue  compared to  or of total revenue in fiscal we released new playstation titles in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in sales was attributable to the greater installed base of playstation game consoles and the releases of key titles for this platform including fifa  world cup and madden nfl we expect revenues from playstation products to continue to grow in fiscal  but as revenues for these products increase  we do not expect to maintain these growth rates 
net revenues derived from other bit products  primarily for saturn  were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we released no new saturn titles in fiscal compared to eight in fiscal we do not expect to release any new saturn titles in fiscal and revenues from the sales of saturn products are not expected to be significant in future years 
net revenues from pc cd products increased to  in fiscal  representing of total net revenues  from  or of total net revenues in fiscal we released pc cd titles in fiscal compared to pc cd titles in fiscal the worldwide increase in sales of pc cd products was primarily attributable to an increase in sales in europe and north america due to the related releases of key titles for this platform including sim city net revenues derived from n video game cartridge products were  or of total net revenues  compared to  or  in fiscal the increase in n revenues was primarily due to more title releases for this platform compared to last year and a larger n market 
we released nine titles in fiscal  including nascar  compared to two titles in fiscal we do not expect significant growth in revenues for n products in fiscal net revenues from shipments of al products in fiscal increased to  or of total revenue  compared to  or of total revenue in fiscal the increase was due to higher sales of al products in north america and europe 
this increase was primarily attributable to the distribution of products published by square ea in north america and the acquisition of abc software in switzerland 
we expect revenues from al products to continue to grow in fiscal  but as revenues for these products increase  we do not expect to maintain these growth rates 
net revenues generated by bit video game cartridge based products were  in fiscal  compared to  or of net revenues in fiscal as the bit video game market has been replaced by bit and bit systems  we did not release any new titles in fiscal we do not expect to release any new titles in fiscal and revenues from the sales of bit products are not expected to be significant 
licensing of ea studio products generated  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the revenues generated by the licensing of our products in europe 
north america net revenues increased by to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase was mainly attributable to strong growth in n and playstation systems  the distribution of al titles and growth in pc cd sales 
net revenues from playstation and n revenues increased  due to a larger market and greater installed base for these platforms as well as more title releases for n in comparison to the prior year 
north america al sales increased by  compared to the prior year primarily due to the distribution of products published by square ea 
pc cd revenues increased by  due to key title releases during the year 
international net revenues increased by to  or of consolidated fiscal net revenues  compared to  or of the fiscal total 
europe s net revenues increased by  primarily due to an increase in sales of playstation and al products 
japan s net revenues increased by  primarily due to the sales of fifa road to world cup asia pacific net revenues decreased by  due to the weakness in asian currencies 
in local currency  in spite of weak economies  net revenues for asia pacific increased compared to the prior year 
change cost of goods sold   as a percentage of net revenues cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal primarily due to lower artist royalties  including savings related to an acquisition of a software development company during fiscal  partially offset by higher sales of lower margin n products 
operating expenses change marketing and sales   as a percentage of net revenues general and administrative   as a percentage of net revenues research and development   as a percentage of net revenues the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily attributable to increased print  internet and television advertising to support new releases and increased cooperative advertising associated with higher revenues in north america and europe as compared to the prior year 
increases in marketing and sales expenses were also due to additional headcount related to the continued expansion of our worldwide distribution business and the acquisitions of abc software and westwood studios 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in headcount and occupancy costs to support the increase in growth in north america and europe operations  including the opening of additional international offices in europe and the acquisition of abc software 
the increase in research and development expenses was due to additional headcount related expenses attributable to the acquisition of westwood studios  inc and certain assets of the irvine  california based virgin studio collectively westwood in september and tiburon entertainment  inc in april  higher development costs per title  as products are including more content and are more complex and time consuming to develop  and an increase in development costs for ultima online 
we released a total of new products in fiscal compared to in fiscal other operating expenses change amortization of intangibles  n m as a percentage of net revenues n a charge for acquired in process technology   n m as a percentage of net revenues merger costs  as a percentage of net revenues n a amortization of intangibles results from the acquisitions of westwood and abc software in the second quarter of fiscal in connection with the purchase of westwood in september  we allocated and expensed  of the  purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of acquisition  this amount was expensed as a non recurring charge as the in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
westwood had three major pc cd projects in progress at the time of the acquisition including two in the best selling franchise command and conquer and one in the critically acclaimed lands of lore series 
as of the acquisition date  costs to complete the westwood projects acquired were expected to be approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we believe there have been no significant changes to these estimates as of march  we currently expect to complete the development of these projects at various dates through fiscal and to publish the products upon completion 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet our design requirements including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
though we currently expect that the acquired in process technology will be successfully developed  there can be no assurance that commercial or technical viability of these products will be achieved 
furthermore  future developments in the entertainment software industry  changes in computer or video game console technology  changes in other product offerings or other developments may cause us to alter or abandon these plans 
the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the completion percentage of research and development efforts at the acquisition date  forecasting risk adjusted revenues considering the completion percentage  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present values 
the completion percentages were estimated based on cost incurred to date  importance of the completed development tasks and the elapsed portion of the total project time 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development is based on unit sales forecasts for worldwide sales territories and adjusted to consider only the revenue related to development achievements completed at the acquisition date 
net cash flow estimates include cost of goods sold and sales  marketing and general and administrative expenses and taxes forecasted based on historical operating characteristics 
in addition  net cash flow estimates were adjusted to allow for fair return on working capital and fixed assets  charges for franchise and technology leverage and return on other intangibles 
appropriate risk adjusted discount rates ranging from to were used to discount the net cash flows back to their present value 
the remaining identified intangibles will be amortized on a straight line basis over two to twelve years based on expected useful lives of franchise tradenames  existing products and technologies  retention of workforce  and other intangible assets 
if these projects are not successfully developed  we may not realize the value assigned to the in process research and development projects 
in addition  the value of other acquired intangible assets may also become impaired 
in conjunction with the merger of westwood  we accrued approximately  related to direct transaction costs and other related accruals 
at march   there were  in accruals remaining related to these items 
additionally  for fiscal  the charge for in process research and development also included write offs of  associated with the acquisition of two software development companies in the first quarter 
for fiscal  we incurred a charge of  for acquired in process technology in connection with the acquisition of the remaining minority ownership interest in electronic arts victor  inc in december this charge was made after we concluded that the in process technology had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software 
on july   we completed a merger with maxis  inc maxis 
in conjunction with the merger  we recorded costs of  which included direct transaction fees and costs associated with integrating the operations of the two companies 
at march   there were no accruals remaining related to these merger costs 
change operating income   as a percentage of net revenues operating income increased due to higher net revenues and related gross profit partially offset by increased operating expenses including the charges for acquired in process technology of  in the current fiscal year partially offset by merger costs of  and a charge for acquired in process technology of  related to the acquisitions in the prior fiscal year 
change interest and other income  net   as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in interest and other income  net  was primarily attributable to the sale of our ownership interest in creative wonders  llc in december the sale resulted in a gain in the prior year of  change income taxes   effective tax rate our effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively affected as there was no tax benefit recorded for a portion of the charges related to the acquired in process technology 
excluding the effect of these charges  the effective tax rate for the current fiscal year would have been as compared to a tax rate in the corresponding prior year periods 
the lower rate of results primarily from a higher portion of international income subject to a lower foreign tax rate as compared to the prior year and an increase in the federal research and experimental credit 
change minority interest in consolidated joint venture   n m as a percentage of net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal  we formed ea square kk which is seventy percent owned by us and thirty percent owned by square co 
ltd 
square  a leading developer and publisher of entertainment software in japan 
minority interest for fiscal represents square s interest in the net income of ea square kk 
for fiscal  the minority interest represented the interest in electronic arts victor  inc eav owned by victor entertainment industries  inc vei 
we acquired the remaining minority ownership interest in eav held by vei in december change net income   as a percentage of net revenues reported net income was flat due to the one time charges related to acquisitions offsetting significantly higher operating income 
the increase in net income  excluding one time charges  was due to higher revenues and gross profits  offset by higher operating expenses 
for fiscal  net income included a one time gain on sale of creative wonders  llc in the amount of  net of taxes  offset by maxis merger costs and a charge for acquired in process developments of  net of taxes 
for fiscal  net income included one time charges for acquired in process technology of  net of taxes 
excluding one time items in both years  as noted above  net income increased to  from  or over the prior year 
results of operations comparison of fiscal to change net revenues   our total net revenues increased compared to the prior year due to increased sales of playstation products  increased worldwide distribution of al products  sales of n video game cartridge products and sales of pc cd products 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales of bit video game cartridges and license oem revenues 
net revenues from bit cd video game products  primarily for the playstation  were  in fiscal  representing of the total net revenues compared to  or of total net revenues in fiscal the increase in sales of bit video game products was attributable to the greater installed base of playstation game consoles and related releases of key titles for this platform during the year offset by a decline in revenues from sales of products for saturn 
sales of playstation products in fiscal increased to  or of total revenue  compared to  or of total revenue in fiscal we released new playstation titles in fiscal compared to in fiscal net revenues derived from the sales of other bit products  primarily from saturn  were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal as the installed base of saturn consoles did not achieve the growth rates of playstation consoles  our revenues from sales of saturn products declined 
we released eight new saturn titles in fiscal compared to in fiscal net revenues from shipments of al products in fiscal increased to  or of total revenue  compared to  or of total revenue in fiscal this increase was due to higher sales of al products in north america  europe and asia pacific 
this increase was attributable to the product releases under a worldwide exclusive distribution agreement with dreamworks interactive  including the lost world jurassic park  and due to continued distribution of products from accolade  inc which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal al revenues also increased as a result of our exclusive distribution agreement with twentieth century fox home entertainment outside north america 
net revenues derived from n video game cartridge products were  or of total net revenues  compared to  in fiscal we released two titles in fiscal compared to one title in fiscal net revenues from pc cd products increased to  in fiscal  representing of total net revenues  from  or of total net revenues in fiscal we released pc cd titles in fiscal compared to pc cd titles in fiscal the increase in sales of pc cd products was attributable to the worldwide growth in the pc market and the expansion of our direct distribution worldwide 
pc cd sales growth for fiscal was partially offset by a decline in titles published by maxis 
maxis pc cd revenues for fiscal decreased by  or compared to fiscal net revenues generated by bit video game cartridge based products were  or of total revenues in fiscal  compared to  or of net revenues in fiscal licensing of ea studio products generated  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the revenues generated by the licensing of our products in europe and japan 
north america net revenues increased by to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase was mainly attributable to strong growth in playstation and n systems as well as al product revenues partially offset by the decline in bit cartridge and saturn product sales 
net revenues from playstation and n products increased  while sales of bit cartridge and saturn products decreased  in comparison to the prior year 
north america al sales increased  compared to the prior year 
international net revenues increased by to  or of consolidated fiscal net revenues  compared to  or of the fiscal total 
the increase in international revenues was due to higher worldwide sales of playstation products and increased sales of pc cd  n and al products in europe and asia pacific 
this was partially offset by a decrease in bit product sales in japan  international bit video game cartridge revenues and licensing of our products 
change cost of goods sold   as a percentage of net revenues cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in fiscal reflected increased product costs associated with increased sales of lower margin affiliated label and n titles  a decrease in higher margin pc cd sales as a proportion of total net revenues and higher professional and celebrity royalties on cd video game and pc cd titles as well as higher manufacturing royalties on cd video game titles 
operating expenses change marketing and sales   as a percentage of net revenues general and administrative   as a percentage of net revenues research and development   as a percentage of net revenues the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily attributable to increased television and print advertising to support new releases and increased cooperative advertising associated with higher revenues as compared to the prior year 
increases in marketing and sales expenses were also due to additional headcount related to the continued expansion of our worldwide distribution business 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in payroll and occupancy costs due to the opening of additional international offices and additional depreciation related to the installation of new management information systems worldwide 
this increase was partially offset by lower spending in japan 
the increase in marketing and sales as well as general and administrative expenses were partially offset by savings attributable to the integration of maxis in the second quarter of fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was due to additional headcount related expenses in north america and europe attributable to increased in house development capacity  higher development costs per title and additional depreciation of computer equipment 
we released a total of new products in fiscal compared to in fiscal other operating expenses change charge for acquired in process technology  n m as a percentage of net revenues n a merger costs  n m as a percentage of net revenues n a in connection with the acquisition of the remaining minority ownership interest in eav in december  we incurred a charge of  for acquired in process technology 
this charge was made after we concluded that the in process technology had no alternative future use after taking into consideration the potential for usage of the software in different products and resale of the software 
on july   we completed a merger with maxis 
in conjunction with the merger  we recorded costs of  which included direct transaction fees and costs associated with integrating the operations of the two companies 
change operating income   as a percentage of net revenues operating income increased due to higher net revenues and related gross profit partially offset by increased operating expenses including the charge for acquired in process technology as well as merger costs related to the acquisition of maxis 
change interest and other income  net   as a percentage of net revenues the increase in other income is primarily due to higher interest income attributable to higher cash balances as compared to the previous year and the sale of our ownership interest in creative wonders  llc in december the sale of creative wonders resulted in a gain of  this increase was partially offset by lower gains on sales of marketable securities in the amount of  compared to  in the prior year 
change income taxes   effective tax rate our effective tax rate was lower for the year as a result of a higher proportion of international income subject to a lower foreign tax rate as compared to the prior year and the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit for the full fiscal year change minority interest in consolidated joint venture   as a percentage of net revenues as discussed above  we acquired the remaining minority ownership interest in eav in december prior to the acquisition  eav was sixty five percent owned by us and thirty five percent owned by vei 
minority interest for the year reflected only a portion of reported losses for eav as the net equity of eav fell below zero in the first quarter of fiscal change net income   as a percentage of net revenues the increase in net income was due to the growth in revenues and gross margins offset by higher operating expenses 
the impact of the gain on sale of creative wonders  llc was offset by the charge for acquired in process technology and merger costs 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   our working capital was  compared to  at march  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by approximately  in fiscal we generated  of cash from operations in fiscal in addition   was provided through the sale of equity securities under our stock plans 
reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased from  at march  to  at march  reserves have been charged for returns of product and price protection credits issued for products sold in prior periods 
management believes these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances 
during fiscal  we invested  in cash for the acquisition of westwood studios  inc   for the acquisition of abc software  approximately  for investment in affiliates and approximately  in long term licenses 
in addition  we invested approximately  for new facilities in europe and canada and  in computer equipment worldwide 
in addition  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately  our principal source of liquidity is  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
management believes the existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
year readiness disclosure background of year issues many currently installed computer systems and software products are unable to distinguish between twentieth century dates and twenty first century dates because such systems may have been developed using two digits rather than four to determine the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this error could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such year requirements 
state of readiness our business is dependent on the operation of numerous systems that could potentially be impacted by year related problems 
those systems include  among others hardware and software systems used to deliver products to our customers  communications networks such as the internet and private intranets  which we depend on to receive orders for products from our customers  the internal systems of our customers and suppliers  products sold to customers  the hardware and software systems used internally in the management of our business  and non information technology systems and services used in the management of our business  such as power  telephone systems and building systems 
based on an analysis of the systems potentially impacted by conducting business in the twenty first century  we are applying a phased approach to making such systems  and accordingly  our operations  ready for the year beyond awareness of the issues and scope of systems involved  the phases of activities in progress include an assessment of specific underlying computer systems  programs and hardware  renovation  replacement or redeployment of year non compliant technology  validation and testing of technologically compliant year solutions  and implementation of the year compliant systems 
as a third party providing software products  we are dependent on the hardware and software products used to deliver such products and services 
if such products are inoperable due to year issues  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
an inventory of our internal business systems has been completed and planned software and hardware upgrades to ensure year compliance are in process 
the upgrades to these systems are expected to be completed by june  costs to date we have not incurred significant costs directly related to year issues  even in cases where non compliant information technology systems were redeployed or replaced 
we believe that future expenditures to upgrade internal systems and applications will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and are primarily included within our ongoing system development plan 
in addition  while the potential costs of redeploying personnel and of any delays in implementing other projects are not known  the costs are anticipated to be immaterial 
risks of the year issues our financial information systems include an integrated suite of business applications developed and supported by oracle corporation 
these applications systems are in place and currently support daily operations in the united states and in europe 
based on representations made by oracle corporation and upon our limited tests  we believe these systems to be year compliant 
we believe our software products are year compliant  however  success of our year compliance efforts may depend on the success of our customers dealing with their year issues 
customer difficulties with year issues might require us to devote additional resources to resolve underlying problems 
failures of our and or third parties computer systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business 
for example  a significant percentage of purchase orders received from our customers are computer generated and electronically transmitted 
in addition  the year could affect the ability of consumers to use our pc based products 
if the computer systems on which the consumers use our products are not year compliant  such noncompliance could affect the consumers ability to use such products 
contingency plans we continue to assess certain of our year exposure areas in order to determine what additional steps beyond those identified by our internal review in the united states are advisable 
we are currently developing a contingency plan for handling year problems that are not detected and corrected prior to their occurrence 
we expect this plan will be completed by june  we believe that the systems  which represent the principal exposures  have been identified  and to the extent necessary  are in the process of being modified to become year compliant 
additionally  we will be conducting tests of our principal business systems to verify that those systems are year compliant 
any failure to address any unforeseen year issue could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
euro conversion on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies the legacy currency and the one common legal currency known as the euro 
from january  through june  the countries will be able to use their legacy currencies or the euro to transact business 
by july   at the latest  the conversion to the euro will be complete at which time the legacy currencies will no longer be legal tender 
the conversion to the euro will eliminate currency exchange rate risk between the member countries 
we do not anticipate any material impact from the euro conversion on our financial information systems which currently accommodate multiple currencies 
computer software changes necessary to comply with the year issue are generally compliant to the euro conversion issue 
due to numerous uncertainties  we cannot reasonably estimate the effect that the euro conversion issue will have on our pricing or market strategies  and the impact  if any  it will have on our financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors ea s business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance 
some of those important risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary or which may materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows product development schedules are frequently unreliable and make predicting quarterly results difficult 
product development schedules  particularly for new hardware platforms and high end multimedia pcs are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process  research and experimentation associated with development for new technologies 
for example  simcity  the follow on product to simcity  was expected to ship in fiscal  at the time of the merger with maxis 
due to additional development delays  that product did not ship until the fourth quarter of fiscal year also  tiberian sun  which was expected to ship in fiscal at the time of the acquisition of westwood studios  is not expected to be released until the second quarter of fiscal due to development delays 
additionally  development risks for cd rom products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief manufacturing lead times allow finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter 
our revenues and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules  and our failure to meet those schedules could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year 
new video game platforms create additional technical and business model uncertainties 
a large portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms such as the playstation and the n the success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video game hardware systems and the life span of older hardware platforms and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful 
sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large installed bases or will continued product development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles than we expected 
conversely  if we do not develop for a platform that achieves significant market acceptance  or discontinue development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than expected  our revenue growth may be adversely affected 
for example  while the sega dreamcast console is scheduled to launch in the united states in late calendar and has already launched in japan  we have no products under development for this platform 
accordingly  we will not have products available should this platform achieve wide market acceptance 
similarly  we intend to launch a variety of products for the new sony playstation platform  the playstation ii  expected to be released in the untied states in september should that platform not achieve wide acceptance by consumers  we will have spent a disproportionate amount of our resources for this platform 
additionally  we have not negotiated publishing agreements with sony  sega or nintendo for their next generation platforms  and we do not know whether the terms of those agreements will be favorable 
the business models and technology for e commerce and online gaming are unproven 
while we do not currently derive significant revenues from online sales of our packaged products or from games played online  we believe that both will become a more significant factor in our business and in the interactive gaming business generally in the future 
e commerce is becoming an increasingly popular method for conducting business with consumers 
how that form of distribution will affect the more traditional retail distribution  at which we have historically excelled  and over what time period  is uncertain 
additionally  technology  staffing and support for sales direct to consumers differ from that required for sales to resellers 
online gaming  and particularly multiplayer online gaming such as our ultima online product  has many risks not currently associated with most packaged good sales including  but not limited to  the following in massively multiplayer games such as ultima online  unanticipated player conduct significantly affects the performance of the game  and social issues raised by players conduct frequently determine player satisfaction 
our ability to effectively proctor such games is uncertain 
the current business model is as yet experimental and maybe unsustainable  whether revenues will continue to be sufficient to maintain the significant support  service and product enhancement demands of online users is uncertain 
we have little experience in pricing strategies for online games or in predicting usage patterns of our customers 
additionally  the speed and reliability of the internet and the performance of a user s internet service provider are not controlled by us but impact both e commerce and online game performance 
whether the internet infrastructure will be adequate to meet increasing demand will affect our ability to grow our internet dependent businesses 
our business  our products  and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories 
legislation is increasingly introduced which may affect the content of our products and their distribution 
for example  privacy rules in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites 
those rules vary by territory while of course the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries 
other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws 
in the united states  in response to recent events  the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as those made by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products 
any one or more of these factors could harm our business 
our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products 
our agreements with hardware licensors  which are also our chief competitors  typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products 
this fact could  in certain circumstances  leave us unable to get our products approved  manufactured and shipped to customers 
in most events  control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently 
for example  in prior years  we experienced delays in obtaining approvals for and manufacturing of playstation products which caused delays in shipping those products 
the potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors 
such occurrences would harm our business and adversely affect our financial performance 
we face intense competition for talent from highly valued internet companies 
competition for employees in the interactive software business continues to be intense 
recently  the most intense competition for recruiting and retaining key employees is from internet companies 
the high market valuations  large equity positions for key executives and creative talent and fast stock price appreciation of these companies make their compensation packages attractive to those who are already working in more mature companies 
this situation creates difficulty for us to compete for the attraction and retention of executive and key creative talent 
foreign sales and currency fluctuations 
for fiscal  international net revenues comprised of total consolidated net revenues 
we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenues 
such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers 
additionally  foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate 
as a result of current economic conditions in asia  we are subject to additional foreign currency risk 
though we do not currently derive a significant portion of revenues and operating profits from sales in asia and other developing countries  our foreign currency exposure may increase as operations in these countries grow and if current economic trends in asia continue 
any of these factors may significantly harm our business 
fluctuations in stock price 
due to analysts expectations of continued growth and other factors  any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
as a result of the factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of our common stock historically has been  and may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations over a short period of time 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer  software  entertainment  media or electronics industries or the securities markets in general 
for example  during the fiscal year  the price per share of our common stock ranged from to 
during the fiscal year  the price per share of our common stock ranged from to because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices 
foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign currency exposures and short term investments are subject to market risk 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities  primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies thereby limiting our risk 
gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts are reflected in the income statement 
at march   we had foreign exchange contracts  all with maturities of less than nine months to purchase and sell approximately  in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds  canadian dollars  german deutschmarks  japanese yen and other european currencies 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate  plus the unamortized premium or discount 
at march   fair value of these contracts is not significant 
the counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at march  the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount forward amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
all contracts mature within nine months 
weighted average contract contract amount rate fair value in thousands in thousands foreign currency to be sold under contract british pound  canadian dollar  japanese yen  south african  rand australian  dollar brazilian real  total  foreign currency to be purchased under contract british pound   total   grand total   while the contract amounts provide one measurement of the volume of these transactions  they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk 
the amounts arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparties obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at our option 
we control credit risk through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio
