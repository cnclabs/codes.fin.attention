see item business regulation thrift and loan regulation 
the thrift s deposits are serviced through branch offices in california 
fremont s insurance premium finance loans and certain of its syndicated loans are also financed by the thrift 
fremont originates real estate loans nationwide through independent loan brokers and through its own marketing representatives 
for commercial real estate loans  principal amounts primarily range between million to million and for residential real estate loans  principal amounts are generally below  the residential real estate loans are originated using underwriting standards that are less stringent than the federal national mortgage association s guidelines and are commonly known as sub prime loans 
to mitigate the higher potential for credit losses that accompanies these types of borrowers  fremont focuses on its loan origination on the higher grades of loans in this category and attempts to maintain underwriting standards that require conservative loan to collateral valuations 
the company s operating strategy is to grow its loan portfolio through origination of new loans and acquisition of loan portfolios that meet its underwriting guidelines applied to origination of new loans 
the loan portfolio of the real estate lending operation grew from million at the end of to billion at the end of  due primarily to increased loan originations and  to a lesser extent  the purchase of loan portfolios from other financial institutions

fremont provides commercial finance loans  primarily secured by accounts receivable  inventory  and machinery and equipment  to small and middle market companies on a nationwide basis 
the total commercial finance loan portfolio was million at december  loan originations are developed primarily by referrals from various financial intermediaries and financial institutions 
see item business financial services operation commercial finance 
the lending market continues to be competitive for small to middle market commercial borrowers 
as a result  fremont s commercial finance loans have experienced decreasing yields 
fremont has interests in large syndicated loans which are originated and serviced by other financial institutions 
syndicated loans generally carry lower yields than the company s commercial finance loans since the borrowers under syndicated loans tend to be larger companies whose credit quality is generally higher than borrowers under the company s commercial finance loans 
these loans are secured by various assets of the borrower and  if applicable  of its subsidiaries 
the syndicated loans are variable rate loans and are originated on both a revolving and fixed term basis 
the term loans are generally issued with terms not in excess of ten years 
the company finances these loans using thrift deposits  as well as financing through an unsecured revolving line of credit with a syndicated bank group  which is also used to finance fremont s commercial finance loans that are not financed under the company s asset securitization program 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the syndicated loan portfolio has grown to million at december  from million at december  this growth has been achieved primarily from development of the customer base through referrals from various financial institutions 
see item business financial services operation syndicated loans 
fremont provides insurance premium finance loans  primarily to small businesses  which finances property and casualty insurance premiums 
these loans are collateralized by the unearned premiums of the underlying insurance policies 
at december   the insurance premium finance loan portfolio totaled million 
the ability of the company to continue to originate loans  and of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  may be impaired by adverse changes in local  regional  or national economic conditions 
such events could also significantly reduce the demand for loans and impair the value of the underlying collateral 
if the collateral were to prove inadequate  fremont s results of operations could be adversely affected 
by engaging in several selected businesses nationwide which are geographically diverse  fremont believes it has achieved stability and provided opportunities for growth in its operating results 
since the year ended december  to the year ended december   the company s income before taxes grew at a compound annual rate of approximately to million for fremont s book value increased from million at december  to million at december  prior to january   the company offered life insurance products  including annuities  credit life and disability insurance and term life insurance for consumers  through a subsidiary 
on december  and on january   the company entered into reinsurance and assumption agreements with a reinsurer whereby assets and liabilities related to certain life insurance and annuity policies were ceded to the reinsurer 
these reinsurance agreements are part of several other agreements which have collectively resulted in the substantial reduction of the company s life insurance operations 
the company continues to remain primarily obligated for approximately million of account value of annuities which  at december   have been fully co insured with great southern insurance company 
the effect on operations from these agreements was not material  and revenue and operating income from this subsidiary were not significant in  or between and  fremont discontinued its domestic treaty reinsurance business  its other primary and excess property and casualty insurance operations and the underwriting of all remaining assumed reinsurance 
in  a single management group was put in charge of all discontinued operations  and it is the intention of the company to complete the liquidation of these operations by the commutation of liabilities and as claims are paid

higher revenues in as compared to resulted from higher financial services revenues  offset partially by lower revenues in the property and casualty segment 
the lower property and casualty revenues were due primarily to the net effects of higher workers compensation insurance premiums and investment income resulting from the acquisitions of unicare on september  and industrial on august   more than offset by additional ceded reinsurance premiums which have the result of lowering premium revenues 
these additional ceded reinsurance premiums were due mainly to additional excess of loss reinsurance purchased for fremont s workers compensation insurance business which became effective january  the acquisition of industrial resulted in higher revenues in the property and casualty insurance segment in as compared to see property and casualty insurance opera tion 
higher revenues in the financial services segment in and as compared to the respective prior year were achieved primarily from increased loan interest revenues which resulted from significant growth in the average financial services loan portfolio

revenues from medical malpractice operations were million and million for and  respectively 
the financial services segment posted income before taxes of million for  as compared to million and million for and  respectively

expenses consist primarily of loss and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses 
premiums 
premiums earned from the company s property and casualty insurance operation were million for  as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the lower insurance premiums in were due mainly to the offsetting effects of higher workers compensation insurance premiums resulting from the acquisitions of unicare and industrial  more than offset by additional ceded reinsurance premiums 
these additional ceded reinsurance premiums were due primarily to additional excess of loss reinsurance purchased for the company s workers compensation insurance business  which became effective january  fremont purchased the additional reinsurance in an effort to further reduce the volatility of operating results which occurs through fluctuations in loss costs 
this additional reinsurance reduced the point at which reinsurers assume liability attachment point from million per loss occurrence to  per loss occurrence 
the higher premiums in were due primarily to the acquisition of industrial 
with this acquisition  fremont further broadened the geographic diversity of its premium writings to include a significant presence in certain western states that the company previously had little or no premium writings in prior to the industrial acquisition 
see item business property and casualty insurance operation and variability of operating results and workers compensation regulation 
net investment income 
net investment income within the property and casualty insurance operation was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
significantly higher invested assets  due primarily to the acquisitions of unicare and industrial  resulted in increased investment income in as compared to the acquisition of industrial also was the main contributor to higher net investment income in as compared to see item business investment portfolio 
loss and loss adjustment expense

in addition  the ratio of these losses and lae to property and casualty insurance premiums earned loss ratio was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the loss ratio in as compared to is due predominately to the additional reinsurance purchased by fremont and which became effective january   offset partially by higher loss ratios in associated with industrial 
see item business property and casualty insurance operation reinsurance ceded and premiums 
the decrease in the loss ratio in is due mainly to the recognition of a decrease in the frequency of reported claims on the and accident years in the company s mid west region  offset partially by higher loss ratios associated with industrial on the accident year 
additionally  the company s management believes that its implementation of more effective claims handling procedures in the mid west region has contributed to the reduction in loss and loss adjustment expenses during calendar year and relating to the and prior accident years 
the company is not able to determine with certainty the specific cause or causes of increases and decreases in reported claims experience  but has reached its own conclusions based on a review of its internal data and a subjective evaluation of external factors 
see item business property and casualty insurance operation loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company regularly reviews its reserving techniques  overall reserve position and reinsurance 
in light of present facts and current legal interpretations  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for loss reserves 
in making this determination  management has considered its claims experience to date  loss development history for prior accident years and estimates of future trends of claims frequency and severity 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
subsequent actual experience has resulted  and could result  in loss reserves being too high or too low 
future loss development could require reserves for prior periods to be increased  which would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses 
the ratio of policy acquisition costs and other operating costs and expenses to premiums earned is referred to as the expense ratio  which was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in this ratio in as compared to is due mainly to a lower premium base in resulting from the additional reinsurance purchased by fremont that became effective january  see premiums 
the increase in this ratio in is due primarily to higher agents commission costs and higher operating costs and expenses 
dividends to policyholders 
the policyholder dividends ratio for the company s property and casualty insurance operation was and in  and  respectively 
there were no dividends accrued in the company believes that these ratios are low by industry standards 
the low ratios are due primarily to the type of workers compensation insurance policies written by the company 
fremont s workers compensation insurance policies are predominately written as non participating  which means that they do not include provisions for dividend consideration 
the dividends accrued in and were due mainly to the acquisition of industrial 
see item business property and casualty insurance operation policyholders dividends 
variability of operating results 
the company s profitability can be affected significantly by many factors including competition  the severity and frequency of claims  interest rates  legislation and regulations  court decisions  the judicial climate  and general economic conditions and trends  all of which are outside of fremont s control 
in addition  fremont s results of operations may be affected by the company s ability to assess and integrate successfully the operations of acquired companies 
these factors have contributed  and in the future could contribute  to significant variation of results of operations in different aspects of the company s business from quarter to quarter and year to year 
with respect to the workers compensation insurance business  changes in economic conditions can lead to reduced premium levels due to lower payrolls as well as increased claims due to the tendency of workers who are laid off to submit workers compensation claims 
legislative and regulatory changes can also contribute to variable operating results for workers compensation insurance businesses 
for example  in  the company experienced the negative impact of lower premiums and lower profitability on fremont s california workers compensation business due to increased price competition resulting from legislation enacted in california in july which  among other things  repealed the minimum rate law effective january  additionally  price competition in illinois  where the company has a significant presence  continues to adversely impact the company s profitability  where overall average decreases of   and in advisory premium rates  which workers compensation insurance companies in illinois tend to follow  became effective january   and  respectively 
see workers compensation regulation 
the acquisition of industrial has mitigated the adverse effects of this price competition in illinois by providing fremont with a broader geographic diversity of its premium writings 
industrial has a significant presence in the western united states  in addition to california 
the company anticipates that its results of operations and financial condition will continue to be adversely affected by the continued price competition in illinois and california 
also  the establishment of appropriate reserves necessarily involves estimates  and reserve adjustments have caused significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year 
fremont s workers compensation insurance business competes in a market characterized by competition on the basis of price and service 
in addition  state regulatory changes could affect competition in the states where the company transacts business 
although the company is one of the largest writers of workers compensation insurance in the nation  certain of its competitors are larger and have greater resources than fremont 
the company cannot be certain that it will continue to maintain its market share in the future 
workers compensation regulation 
the company s workers compensation insurance operations are concentrated in california and illinois  with additional writings in other states and the district of columbia 
insurance companies are subject to supervision and regulation by the state insurance authority in each state in which they transact business 
such supervision and regulation relate to the numerous aspects of an insurance company s business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of such supervision and regulation is the protection of policyholders rather than the investors or stockholders of an issuer 
fremont s multistate insurance operations require  and will continue to require  the company to devote significant resources to comply with the regulations of each state in which the company transacts business 
at december   approximately of the company s workers compensation insurance policies inforce were in california and illinois 
illinois began operating under an open rating system in and california began operating under such a system effective january  in an open rating system  workers compensation companies are provided with advisory premium rates expected losses and expenses or loss costs expected losses only which vary by job classification 
each insurance company determines its own rates based in part upon its particular loss experience and operating costs 
insurance companies generally set their premium rates below such advisory rates 
this characteristic has resulted in continued price competition in illinois  where overall average decreases in advisory premium rates of   and became effective january   and  respectively 
before january   california operated under a minimum rate law  whereby premium rates established by the california department of insurance were the minimum rates which could be charged by an insurance carrier 
the repeal of the minimum rate law has resulted in lower premiums and lower profitability on the company s california workers compensation insurance policies due to increased price competition 
most of the states in which fremont writes premiums operate under some form of open rating system

financial services operation the financial services operation of fgcc is principally engaged in commercial and residential real estate lending  commercial finance  syndicated loans and insurance premium financing 
revenues consist principally of interest income and  to a lesser extent  fees and other income 
the following table presents information with respect to fremont s financial services operation year ended december  thousands of dollars revenues    expenses    income before taxes    revenues increased and in and  respectively  due primarily to greater loan interest revenue attributable to growth in the average financial services loan portfolio 
the average financial services loan portfolio grew in to billion from billion and billion in and  respectively 
additionally  higher revenues resulted in from increased gains on residential real estate loan sales 
these loan sales are pursuant to a program  initiated by the company in and expanded in  of selling certain residential real estate loans to other financial institutions 
this has allowed fremont an opportunity to become more selective in its residential real estate loan portfolio  as well as to offer a broader range of residential real estate loans to its customers  primarily through independent brokers 
these loan sales are made without recourse to the company or its subsidiaries 
due to market disruption and oversupply  fremont observed that prices for these loans began to decrease in late the company  rather than sell the loans at prices lower than what it believed was the economic benefit to be derived  began a program to retain these benefits by either retaining the loans in its portfolio or by securitizing them 
on march   the company s thrift issued  through the fremont home loan owner trust  its first securitization of these loans in the amount of approximately million 
this trust issued notes collateralized by a pool of these first lien residential mortgage loans 
the notes are subject to an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee of timely payment of interest and ultimate payment of loan principal provided by a financial guarantee insurance policy issued by financial security assurance inc servicing of the loans will be provided by fairbanks capital corporation 
these notes have been rated aaa by standard and poor s and aaa by moody s 
income before taxes in the financial services operation was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the and increases in income before taxes in and respectively  are mainly due to the previously described growth in the average financial services loan portfolio  as well as lower loan loss provisions relative to loans receivable  which resulted from improved loan loss experience  partially offset by increases in operating expenses 
additionally  in higher income before taxes resulted from the increased gains on residential real estate loan sales

the margin between the company s interest income and expense net yield decreased in and as compared to the respective prior year  due mainly to the offsetting effects of a decrease in the net yields on commercial finance loans and increases in syndicated loans which generally carry lower net yields  offset partially by an increase in the net yields on real estate loans 
net yields decreased on commercial finance loans due primarily to a continuation of the competitive environment 
while the overall net yield on real estate loans increased  this was the combined result of increases in the net yields on commercial real estate loans  partially offset by decreases in the net yields on residential real estate loans

during  the company began originating both commercial and residential real estate loans outside of california 
the company intends to seek portfolio growth outside of california in order to achieve greater geographic diversity in its loan portfolio and thereby lessen fremont s exposure to regional economic conditions 
the total amount of commercial and residential real estate loans outstanding on properties located outside of california at december  was million and million  respectively 
during periods when economic conditions are unfavorable  fremont s financial services businesses may not be able to originate new loan products or maintain credit quality at previously attained levels 
this may negatively affect the company s net finance income and levels of non performing assets and net charge offs 
changes in market interest rates  or in the relationships between various interest rates  could cause the company s interest margins to vary and may result in significant changes in the prepayment patterns of fremont s finance receivables  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
fremont s financial services businesses maintain reserves for credit losses on its portfolio of finance receivables in amounts that fremont believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against potential losses 
the company attempts to minimize the impact that adverse economic developments could have on fremont s finance services loan portfolio by concentrating primarily on lending on a senior and secured basis and by carefully monitoring the underlying collateral that secures these loans 
although the company believes that its level of reserves is sufficient to cover potential credit losses  fremont s reserves could prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in economic conditions or discrete events that adversely affect specific borrowers  industries or markets 
any of these changes could impair fremont s ability to realize the expected value of the collateral securing certain of its finance receivables 
fremont s financial services businesses compete in markets that are highly competitive and are characterized by factors that vary based upon product and geographic region 
the markets in which the company competes are typically characterized by a large number of competitors who compete based primarily upon price  terms and loan structure 
fremont primarily competes with banks  mortgage  insurance  and finance companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than fremont 
the competitive forces of these markets could adversely affect the company s net finance income  loan origination volume or net credit losses

additionally  a lower loan loss provision occurred in as the company was adversely impacted in by a specific loan loss provision associated with one commercial finance loan 
substantially all of the charge offs on commercial finance loans in were related to this loan 
the company s overall improved loan loss experience is evidenced by the decreases in the ratio of net charge offs to average total loans receivable over the three years ended december   as well as the decrease of the ratio of non performing assets to total loans receivable from to in the preceding table 
additionally  the reductions in the charge off ratio occurred during a period in which loans receivable increased 
market risk fremont is subject to market risk resulting primarily from fluctuations in interest rates arising from balance sheet financial instruments such as investments  loans and debt 
in the property and casualty insurance operation  the greatest interest rate risk exposure occurs where the interest rate of the financial instrument is fixed in nature and there is a difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate 
the greatest interest rate risk exposure in the financial services operation occurs when interest rate gaps arise wherein assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rates are tied 
changes in interest rates will affect the company s net investment income  loan interest  interest expense and total stockholders equity 
the objective of fremont s asset and liability management activities is to provide the highest level of net interest income and to seek cost effective sources of capital  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
the company has designated its entire investment portfolio as investments that would be available for sale in response to changing market conditions  liquidity requirements  interest rate movements and other investment factors 
see item business investment portfolio 
fremont currently owns no derivative financial instruments and  consequently  is not subject to market risk for such off balance sheet financial instruments 
furthermore  the company does not have exposure to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
property and casualty insurance operation interest rate risk the property and casualty insurance operation has exposure to changes in long term interest rates due mainly to the significant investment in the available for sale investment portfolio 
fluctuations in these interest rates affect the carrying value of the fixed rate investments resulting in fluctuations in unrealized gains and losses on investments  which also affects the company s stockholders equity 
for an investment in a fixed rate bond  a rise in market interest rates for bonds with a similar remaining term and face amount will result in a decline in the fair value of the fixed rate bond 
the converse situation applies as well 
the following table presents principal cash flows of the investment portfolio by expected maturity dates

interest rate gaps may arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals or different market indices to which the instruments interest rate is tied and to this degree earnings will be sensitive to interest rate changes 
additionally  interest rate gaps could develop between the market rate and the interest rate on loans in the company s financial services loan portfolio  which could result in borrowers prepaying their loan obligations to fremont 
while the company attempts to match the characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the effect of fluctuations in interest rates  fremont does not currently utilize derivative financial instruments to meet these objectives 
for the financial services operation  the expected maturity date does not necessarily reflect the net market risk exposure because certain instruments are subject to interest rate changes before expected maturity

year readiness disclosure problems may arise from computer software programs and operating systems that use only two digits to designate the calendar year in a date code field 
for example  where the date december   is encoded as instead of based on this two digit format for date coding  computers with date sensitive programs could recognize the year as and incorrectly assume that the year is similar problems can arise for systems dependent upon embedded chips that are encoded to only use or recognize two digits when referring to a calendar year 
additionally  problems may arise from the computer s inability to process including calculating  comparing  sequencing  displaying  or storing  transmit  or receive date data from  into  and between the th and st centuries  and during the years and  and leap year calculations 
fremont refers to these problems as the year problem 
the company considers the year problem a critical business continuity issue and has categorized the year problem into the following four areas office facilities and equipment will the telephones  facsimile machines  copy machines  elevators  air conditioning and heating systems  and other utility systems used by fremont in its leased and owned facilities function properly in the year and beyond key business partners  vendors  other suppliers will fremont s key business partners  major vendors  and other suppliers face significant disruption to the goods and services provided to the company due to year problems customers will fremont s revenues be significantly adversely affected by customers inability to remediate successfully their own year problems internal computer systems considered the most important area to resolve  will the company s computer systems operate properly in the year and beyond the following discussion establishes the extent of work performed  or to be performed  and results obtained as of january  in addressing the impact of the year problem on the above described areas 
office facilities and equipment the company has evaluated all of its telephone systems to determine the extent of any year problems 
the majority of the company s telephone systems have been rendered year compliant 
the remaining non compliant systems are expected to be compliant by june  regarding the company s leased facilities  we have inquired from facility owners the extent of any year problems if any as they relate to the elevator  air conditioning heating  and other utility systems in these facilities 
fremont has evaluated representations rendered by these facility owners for most of the company s leased facilities 
based on the representations received through january   fremont anticipates no significant disruption from these various facility related systems due to the year problem 
further  with respect to fremont s owned facilities  an evaluation of the extent of any year problems relating to these facilities utility and elevator systems has been made and no significant disruptions if any to the company s operations from these systems are anticipated 
finally  with regard to office equipment such as facsimile and copy machines  fremont considers the risk minimal as to any significant cost or disruption to its operations resulting from a year problem impacting any of its office equipment excluding telephone and computer systems 
accordingly  no significant work is currently being planned in this area 
key business partners  vendors  other suppliers fremont has identified its key business partners  such as its critical banking  employee benefits  reinsurance  auditors  outside legal counsel  and other professional service relationships 
the company has been surveying all of these relationships as to their year compliance  and will develop appropriate contingency plans in its effort to avoid significant disruption to fremont s operations 
the company anticipates this process to be completed by june  many surveys have already been received and evaluated in the areas of employee benefits and reinsurance 
based on the evaluations received to date  most of these business partners have stated that they anticipate their year compliance and testing to be completed in early in addition to key business partners  the company s suppliers and vendors are concentrated into the areas of office supplies  office furniture and equipment  and computer hardware and software 
with the exception of computer software  fremont believes that there are many alternative suppliers for their office supply and furniture needs  as well as several alternative sources for computer hardware 
accordingly  the risk of a significant disruption to the company s operations due to a supplier s inability to resolve its year problems is considered minimal since fremont could select an alternate supplier 
with regard to computer software  refer to the separate discussion on the company s internal computer systems 
in an effort to identify which suppliers may have year compliance difficulties  the company has identified its more significant suppliers vendors and has been surveying them as to their year compliance status 
the results of these surveys will be evaluated and appropriate contingency plans will be developed if considered necessary 
fremont expects this process to be completed by june  customers in the financial services operation  fremont s revenues could be impacted should a customer borrower be unable to pay interest and or principal when due because of the customers inability to resolve its year problems 
regarding commercial and residential real estate loans  the risk of a significant impact to operating results is considered minimal since fremont would utilize the collateral securing existing loans to mitigate any loan losses 
additionally for commercial real estate loans  the borrower s year risk is further limited by the multiple tenant nature of most of the properties under collateral 
the company has focused its attention on those commercial properties that are single tenant  which are comprised of approximately fifty loans as of january  fremont has been surveying these customers to determine their year compliance 
for commercial finance loans  the company has been surveying its entire customer base to ascertain whether or not any significant year issues exist with existing borrowers 
with regard to new loan customers  the company has adopted additional review procedures for both real estate and commercial finance loans to determine the extent of an applicant s year compliance 
based on the results obtained to date  fremont does not anticipate any significant impact to its financial services revenues due to the year problem 
for fremont s thrift deposits  the company s effort to mitigate the risk of significant depositor withdrawals has been pursued through an educational program  as recommended by the fdic  aimed at informing current and prospective depositors as to the thrift s year compliance efforts and results 
in its property and casualty insurance operation  fremont has determined the extent of procedures to employ in ascertaining the potential impact to its insurance premium revenues resulting from an insured s or agent s inability to resolve their year problems 
the procedures primarily relate to surveying the company s major insureds and agents as to the extent of any year problems which would significantly impact their operations 
fremont anticipates completing these procedures by june  and will develop appropriate contingency plans should a significant year problem be identified from these surveys 
internal computer systems as of january   significant year compliance issues remain only within fremont s property and casualty insurance operation 
the company s computer based systems systems supporting the financial services operation  administrative systems personnel  payroll and accounting and treasury systems cash management and investment portfolio management have all been rendered substantially year compliant 
within the financial services segment  substantially all operations utilize application systems that are vendor supported 
for commercial and residential real estate lending  all current application systems are substantially year compliant 
additionally  these application systems have been tested internally to validate their year compliance  with no significant errors identified or left unresolved 
similarly  the application systems for commercial finance lending and syndicated loans  while substantially compliant in their present form  will be fully compliant after upgrading to the current version of the software  which is already available and installed at several of the vendor s clients 
fremont intends to install the software upgrades and test these systems to verify the vendors representations 
the company expects to complete these procedures by june  with regard to the property and casualty insurance operation  the company developed an action plan in to render its workers compensation systems year compliant 
based on an evaluation of the progress made as of january   fremont believes that its systems that support its california operations are year compliant including testing  and the company estimates that the systems that support its non california operations  excluding those systems supporting recently acquired industrial  will be year compliant and tested by march  industrial s systems are expected to be converted to year compliant systems by september  the property and casualty insurance operation will be moving onto new systems that will  after full implementation  be the workers compensation operation s new nationwide claims and policy handling platform 
the costs to be incurred by fremont in completing these year initiatives are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations costs of approximately million 
regarding administrative and back office operations  fremont believes that its personnel  payroll  accounting  and treasury systems are year compliant 
the company intends to test these systems by june  to verify the vendors representations 
in addition to its various application systems  fremont maintains several pc based client server network infrastructures 
the majority of these installations were established within the past five years 
substantially all of these networks use the most current versions of network operating and data transmission software  all of which are believed to be year compliant 
the company is in the process of testing vendors representations as to year compliance of installed network software 
these processes are anticipated to be completed by march  with no significant year problems expected 
additionally  the company has inventoried all of its pc hardware 
substantially all of the pc hardware is believed to be year compliant and the company anticipates that any non compliant pc hardware will be rendered year compliant by june  management of the company continues to monitor the progress of its year compliance initiatives and will continue to allocate resources necessary to resolve significant year problems as they are identified 
based on the progress of the work performed through january   fremont anticipates that its office facilities and equipment  key business partners  vendors and other suppliers  major customers  and internal computer systems will be substantially year compliant before december  for all mission critical systems  fremont is developing appropriate contingency plans in the event an unanticipated year problem occurs 
these plans are expected to be completed by september  risk factors due to the dependence of fremont s insurance services and financial services businesses on computer technology to operate its businesses  and the dependence of the insurance and financial services industries on computer technology  the nature and impact of year processing failures on the company s businesses could be material 
fremont believes its mission critical systems will be substantially year compliant by september  the company cannot assure you that its year compliance efforts will be completed in a timely manner or that the company s year compliance efforts will be successful even if these compliance efforts are completed in a timely manner 
it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen in connection with the year problem after december  despite fremont s best efforts to mitigate and remediate its year problem  if key business partners  vendors and other suppliers  facility owners  or customers have over estimated their own year readiness  or been less than truthful or forthcoming in their year readiness disclosure  fremont will be forced to implement certain of its contingency plans  and may be jeopardized with respect to its own year compliance status 
in this scenario  it is possible that fremont may experience unfavorable business factors and expenditures in excess of budget which could result in a negative effect on results of operations in one or all of the company s businesses  depending upon the specific nature of the problem or problems 
worst case scenarios events the company does not anticipate will occur might involve the inability of several of the company s workers compensation insurance operation s major insureds  and or agents  to resolve their respective year problem 
if this were to occur  effects could include the loss of business that might be material to fremont 
furthermore  negative economic conditions precipitated by the year problem could adversely impact the financial services operation s ability to originate loans or maintain credit quality at previously attained levels and could negatively affect fremont s net finance income  levels of non performing assets and net charge offs 
fremont s operations are highly dependent on the ability of its banking business partners to process its financial transactions 
if the company s key banking business partners  as well as the banking industry in general  fail to resolve their respective year problems  if any  serious consequences to fremont could result including the disruption to its normal pattern of cash flows  or increased risk for possible legal actions for breach of contract or other harm 
these consequences could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
while the company does not anticipate any of these scenarios to occur  in making its own year readiness disclosure statements  fremont has relied upon the honesty and forthrightness of its key business partners  vendors and other suppliers  facility owners and customers in making their respective year readiness representations to the company 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in this year readiness disclosure section should be read in conjunction with the company s cautionary statements at the beginning of this section
