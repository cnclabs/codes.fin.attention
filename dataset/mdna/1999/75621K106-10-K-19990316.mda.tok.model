in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company is required to make distributions to its stockholders of at least of reit taxable income

inflation certain office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations

the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset by contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above 
the credit facility and the term loan bear interest at a variable rate  which will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  and are sensitive to inflation 
impact of year some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has completed an assessment to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
currently  the entire property management system is year compliant and has been thoroughly tested 
since the company s accounting software is maintained and supported by an unaffiliated third party  the total year project cost as it relates to the accounting software is estimated to be minimal 
the year project is estimated to be completed not later than july   which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems 
additionally  the company has received assurances from its contractors that all of the company s building management and mechanical systems are currently year compliant or will be made compliant prior to any impact on those systems 
however  the company cannot guarantee that all contractors will comply with their assurances and therefore  the company may not be able to determine year compliance of those contractors 
at that time  the company will determine the extent to which the company will be able to replace non compliant contractors 
the company believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
to date  the company has expended approximately  and expects to expend an additional one million dollars in connection with upgrading building management  mechanical and computer systems 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and costs of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
in a worst case scenario  the company believes that failure of the building management and mechanical systems to operate properly would result in inconveniences to the building tenants which might include no elevator service  lighting or entry and egress 
in this case  the management of the company would manually override such systems in order for normal operations to resume 
additionally  in a worst case scenario of the failure of the third party to deliver  on a timely basis  the necessary upgrades to the accounting software  the company would be required to process transactions  such as the issuance of disbursements  manually until an alternative system was implemented 
if the company is not successful in implementing their year compliance plan  the company may suffer a material adverse impact on their consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
because of the importance of addressing the year issue  the company expects to develop contingency plans if they determine that the compliance plans will not be implemented by july  funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income or loss  excluding gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
see selected financial data 
in march  nareit issued a white paper analysis to address certain interpretive issues under its definition of ffo 
the white paper provides that amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non rental real estate assets are no longer to be added back to net income to arrive at ffo 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  the company s calculation of ffo presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies 
the following table presents the company s ffo calculation for the years ended december  in thousands income before preferred dividends and distributions  limited partners interest in the operating partnership and extraordinary items    less preferred dividends and distributions  extraordinary loss  net of limited partners interest in theoperating partnership of  and  respectively   limited partners minority interest in the operating partnership    net income available to common shareholders    adjustments for funds from operations add limited partners minority interest in the operating partnership    depreciation and amortization    minority interests in consolidated partnerships  extraordinary loss  net of limited partners interest in the operating partnership of  and  respectively   less gain on sale of property amount distributed to minority partners in consolidated partnerships    basic funds from operations    add dilutive preferred distributions  diluted fund from operations    weighted average shares units outstanding    diluted weighted average shares units outstanding    assumes conversion of limited partnership units of the operating partnership
