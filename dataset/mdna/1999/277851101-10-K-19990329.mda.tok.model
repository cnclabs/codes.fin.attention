under the company s policy of expensing pre opening costs as incurred  income from operations  on an annual and quarterly basis  could be adversely affected during periods of restaurant development 
however  the company believes that its initial investment in the restaurant pre opening costs yields a long term benefit of increased operating income in subsequent periods 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position no 
sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which requires start up costs to be expensed as incurred 
sop is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   although earlier application is encouraged

provision for impairment of long lived assets in  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
pursuant to sfas  the company s restaurants are reviewed on an individual restaurant basis for indicators of impairment  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its restaurants may not be recoverable 
the company s primary test for an indicator of potential impairment is operating losses 
in order to determine whether an impairment has occurred  the company estimates the future net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of its restaurants and the eventual disposition  as of the date of determination  and compares such estimated future cash flows to the respective carrying amounts 
those restaurants which have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future cash flows are deemed impaired 
the carrying value of these restaurants is adjusted to an estimated fair value by discounting the estimated future cash flows attributable to such restaurants using a discount rate equivalent to the rate of return the company expects to achieve from its investment in newly constructed restaurants 
the excess is charged to expense and cannot be reinstated 
considerable management judgment and certain significant assumptions are necessary to estimate future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions used by the company in evaluating its assets for impairment include  but may not be limited to estimations of future sales levels  costs of sales  direct and indirect costs of operating the assets  the length of time the assets will be utilized and the company s ability to utilize equipment  fixtures and other moveable long lived assets in other existing or future locations 
in addition  such estimates and assumptions include anticipated operating results related to certain profit improvement programs implemented by the company during and  as well as the continuation of certain rent reductions  deferrals  and other negotiated concessions from certain landlords 
actual results could vary significantly from management s estimates and assumptions and such variance could result in a change in the estimated recoverability of the company s long lived assets 
accordingly  the results of the changes in those estimates could have a material impact on the company s future results of operations and financial position 
during  the company recorded a  provision for impairment of long lived assets related to one restaurant 
during  the company recorded an  provision for impairment of long lived assets related to three locations 
in the normal course of business  management performs a regular review of the strength of its operating assets 
it is management s plan to continue to make such decisions to close under performing restaurants and or dispose of other assets it considers in the best long term interest of the company s shareholders

the provision for income taxes was   and  respectively  for  and at december   the company has recorded a benefit for its deferred tax assets of approximately  management believes that  of the assets will be recognized through the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences with the remainder to be recognized through realization of future income 
it is management s opinion  based on the historical trend of normal and recurring operating results  present store development and forecasted operating results  that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the approximately  in the future net income in the next two years necessary to recognize the deferred tax assets not otherwise offset by reversing taxable temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until and general business tax credits until while management of the company is not presently aware of any adverse matters  it is possible that the company s ability to realize the deferred income tax assets could be impaired if there are significant future exercises of non qualified stock options or if the company were to experience declines in sales and or profit margins as a result of loss of market share  increased competition or other adverse general economic conditions 
management intends to evaluate the realizability of the net deferred tax asset at least quarterly by assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
net income per share amounts in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  earnings per share  which requires the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share eps 
basic eps includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
the weighted average common shares outstanding for the basic eps calculation were   and  in  and  respectively 
diluted eps is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive common stock equivalents 
the sum of the weighted average common shares and common share equivalents for the diluted eps calculation were   and  in  and  respectively 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas in the fourth quarter of  and  as required  has restated all prior period eps amounts to conform to the new accounting standard 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food and beverage products  labor and real estate can affect the company s operations 
over the past few years  inflation has had a lesser impact on the company s operations due to the lower rates of inflation in the nation s economy and the economic conditions in the company s market area 
management believes the company has historically been able to pass on increased costs through certain selected menu price increases and increased productivity and purchasing efficiencies  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so in the future 
management anticipates that the average cost of restaurant real estate leases and construction costs could increase in the future which could affect the company s ability to expand

in connection with this transaction  the company entered into a new credit facility with a bank in the aggregate amount of  of which a maximum of  is available to the company under a revolving line of credit and  was available to the company under a term loan 
certain proceeds of the term loan approximately million were used for the stock purchase from the sellers

year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive or embedded computer chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations which could disrupt the company s normal business activities 
the company has completed its initial assessment of the year compliance issue 
the assessment was conducted reviewing internal and external year compliance issues 
based on the assessments  the company has developed a plan to prepare for the year issue 
the plan involves review of hardware and software systems for compliance  replacement  remediation or modification of non compliant systems  testing existing  replaced  remediated or modified systems to confirm compliance  and implementation 
the company has determined  based on its assessment that a substantial amount of software and hardware used internally will require modification or replacement 
the company believes that with modifications and replacements of software and hardware systems currently identified  the risk associated with the year issue can be mitigated 
if the modifications and replacements of critical hardware and software systems used by the company were not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
in addition to assessing internal year compliance  the company is continuing to gather information pertaining to key third parties conducting business with the company and their year compliance status 
as of december   the company is in excess of complete on the modification and remediation of existing software and hardware 
completion of modification and remediation is expected by may  testing of these systems is expected to be complete by june  these internal systems relate primarily to financial and management information systems 
the company s non informational technology systems consist primarily of restaurant operating equipment including its point of sale systems 
the assessment of these systems has indicated that of the systems are year compliant 
the company plans to replace the non compliant point of sale systems prior to year end while the company believes that of the non information systems are year compliant  it plans to continue testing its operating equipment and expects to complete testing by june  the company s significant third party business partners consists principally of suppliers  banks  and its franchisees 
the company does not have any material or significant systems interfaces with third parties 
an initial inventory of significant third parties has been completed and information requests regarding year compliance have been sent 
the company is developing contingency plans by june  for any significant third parties that appear to be year non compliant 
the company is using internal and external sources to review and identify  remediate  test and implement systems for year readiness 
the cost of the year compliance  excluding internal personnel costs  as of december  are estimated to be approximately  of which approximately  are capitalized as equipment and software 
the company estimates that an additional  exclusive of internal personnel costs  will be spent before december on year compliance of which approximately  is estimated to be capitalized equipment and software 
the company believes it has in place a plan that will resolve its year issue in a timely manner 
due to the forward looking nature and lack of historical experience with year issues however  it is difficult to predict with certainty the results of year compliance issues after december  it is likely  despite the company s efforts  that there will be disruptions and unexpected business problems during the year in addition  despite the company s efforts it may experience unanticipated third party failures  general public infrastructure failures and or failures to successfully conclude its remediation efforts as planned 
the company may be required to utilize manual processing of certain otherwise automated processes primarily related to payroll and cash management 
any of these unforeseen events could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition  and or cash flows in and beyond 
the amount of potential loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of the date of this report  the company has an available revolving line of credit in the amount of  as well as outstanding borrowings under a term loan of approximately  both loans bear interest at floating rate of three month libor plus as of the date of this report 
thus  the company is exposed to the risk of earnings losses due to increases in three month libor 
to hedge its risk exposure to potential increases in three month libor  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a bank
