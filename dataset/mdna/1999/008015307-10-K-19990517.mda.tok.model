year general aerosonic corporation s company wide year project project is proceeding on schedule 
the project is addressing the issue of computer programs being able to distinguish between the year and the year since  the company has purchased and utilized generic software programs supplied by vendors for its accounting  manufacturing and payroll functions 
embedded in the cost of these computer programs from the various vendors  were free software upgrades to include year capabilities 
project aerosonic s project is divided into three major sections  software embedded in products sold to customers  infrastructure applications software and associated hardware and key vendor certifications 
software developed for use in various product lines has been upgraded to accommodate the year issue 
production deliveries have commenced on products with the upgraded software 
therefore  company management believes that the year issue will not have a material impact on product sales 
software programs utilized by the company in its manufacturing  accounting and payroll functions were all purchased by third party vendors and included upgrades for  among other things  the year issue 
as of january   all upgrades provided by software vendors  which include compliance with the year issue  have been installed and are undergoing testing to ensure compliance with the year issue 
management expects to complete the testing of all upgraded software by october  in may  questionnaires requiring vendor certifications were sent to all key vendors 
these certifications address issues primarily related to the vendors ability to provide uninterrupted service or product flow to the company into the new millennium 
as of january   approximately of all vendors questioned completed the questionnaire and certified that they are either in compliance or will be in compliance prior to the year costs the total costs associated with required modifications to become year compliant have not been material to the company s financial position to date 
additionally  anticipated costs to complete the year project are not anticipated to be material to the company s financial position 
arrangements with all software vendors include free upgrades on an ongoing basis  which include upgrades for the year issue 
incidental costs such as clerical labor to perform testing of upgraded software  postage and clerical labor to administer the vendor questionnaires as well as management level review of the results are not expected to materially impact the financial position of the company 
risks the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party vendors and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of its material external agents 
the company believes that  with the completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
aerosonic corporation believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be business interruptions with trading partners due to problems inherent in their own systems 
this problem is not anticipated to have a significant impact given that the company trades with a high number of vendors and customers  thereby minimizing its exposure to any one trading partner 
contingency plan aerosonic corporation s contingency plan is scheduled to be completed by the middle of the contingency plan will include a team to be established to monitor all critical systems through significant date transitions and to promptly respond to any problems 
acquisitions currently  the company has no arrangements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions 
however  the company continues to monitor acquisition opportunities 
accounting standards in  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires an entity to recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements  to measure those instruments at fair value and to reflect the changes in fair value of those instruments as either components of comprehensive income or in net income  depending on the types of those instruments 
aerosonic corporation does not use derivatives or other financial products for speculative purposes 
the company has not yet determined to what extent the standard will impact its financial statements 
other matters major emphasis is being devoted to continuing last year s effort of sales expansion 
the areas of focus lie with the introduction of a wider array of products that incorporate both existing designs and new technology allowing the company to compete for a larger portion of cockpit panel space 
additionally  these new designs incorporate technology that enables a higher degree of automation in the production process  thereby increasing production efficiencies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk exposure for the company is interest rate risk 
the company does not currently utilize any financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its variable rate short term and long term borrowings 
a hypothetical increase in the company s weighted average interest rate would not have a significant effect on the company s net income in the next fiscal year 
additionally  due to the variable interest rate nature of the company s long term borrowings a decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the outstanding long term debt at january
