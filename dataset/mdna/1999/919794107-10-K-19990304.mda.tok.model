year most computer programs have historically been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
these programs were written without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century and the programs may experience problems handling dates beyond the year this could cause computer applications to fail or to create erroneous results unless corrective measures are taken 
incomplete or untimely resolution of the year yk issue could have a material adverse impact on valley s business  operations and financial condition in the future 
valley has assessed the yk issue as it impacts its internal information technology it systems computer hardware and software systems and its non it systems facilities  equipment and vendors and has developed its plan to address the yk issue 
valley operates its deposit  loan and general ledger systems on one software system licensed to valley through a third party primary software vendor 
valley received the software from its primary software vendor and began testing during september to verify the vendor s representation that the software is yk compliant 
the testing for the deposit  loan and general ledger systems  which are the primary functions of this software  has been completed as of the end of additional yk software systems have been purchased from other vendors and valley has substantially completed testing those systems for yk compliance 
valley believes it has identified equipment which needs to be upgraded and is in the process of remediation 
valley currently believes its yk compliance plan with respect to its internal hardware and software systems will not have a material adverse effect on valley s financial condition or results of operations 
however  no assurance can be given that the ultimate costs to address the yk issue or the impact of any failure to timely achieve substantial yk compliance will not have a material adverse effect on valley s financial condition or results 
valley will utilize both internal and external sources to execute its yk plan 
valley s main software system is licensed through its primary software vendor for which valley pays a normal annual licensing fee 
as noted above  the vendor has represented that this software system is yk compliant  and valley has substantially completed testing this system for yk compliance 
as a result  valley has been able to maintain a low level of expenditures to date 
since implementing the assessment of yk issues  valley s costs to external sources have been approximately thousand 
based on current information  valley estimates that expenditures related to the execution of its yk plan will be approximately million 
these estimates of expenditures are based on valley s presently available information and may be updated as information becomes available 
the remaining amount to be spent is for additional hardware and software systems 
valley has also communicated with its significant suppliers  vendors and borrowing customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to the failure of these third parties to remedy any yk issues 
valley can give no assurance that failure to address yk issues by third parties on whom valley s systems  business processes or loan payments rely would not have a material adverse effect on valley s operations or financial condition 
valley has implemented a customer awareness program on its website  in brochures in each of its branches and in messages on customer statements to keep customers informed about yk as it relates to valley 
valley has established a contingency plan for the applications critical to its operations 
this plan includes trigger dates in which a contingency vendor would be contacted 
the testing phase is almost complete  and valley does not foresee converting any of these applications to a contingency vendor at this time 
business segments vnb has three major business segments it monitors and reports on to manage its business operations 
these segments are commercial lending  consumer lending and investment management 
lines of business and actual structure of operations determine each segment 
each is reviewed routinely for its asset growth  contribution to pretax net income and return on assets 
expenses related to the branch network  all other components of retail banking  along with the back office departments of the bank are allocated to each of the three business segments 
the financial reporting for each segment contains allocations and reporting in line with vnb s operations  which may not necessarily be compared to any other financial institution 
the accounting for each segment includes internal accounting policies designed to measure consistent and reasonable financial reporting 
for financial data on the three business segments see part ii
