net income loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues decreased approximately due to a decrease in revenues from north american services partially offset by a increase in revenues from international operations 
total revenues from north american operations were million in fiscal revenues from electric utilities  telecommunications companies  and gas utilities constituted  and  respectively of such fiscal revenues 
revenues from electric utilities decreased substantially in fiscal  primarily from the company s largest customer  florida power light 
revenues from this customer dropped from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenues from telecommunications companies increased in fiscal due primarily to expansion of service capabilities to existing customers 
revenues from north american installation and replacement services were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal decreased replacement services for florida power light accounted for most of this decrease 
accompanying this decline  the amount of cable installation or replacement dropped nationwide from miles in to miles in early in the year  the company purchased new equipment to add flowmole drilling systems to its north american operations in support of an anticipated increase in work from florida power and light 
such work was curtailed in the second and third quarters of the year 
in january  the company resumed work under a new three year contract with this customer 
the total number of drilling systems increased nationwide from at april  to at march  the company also increased its capacity to perform traditional trenching services  especially for the telecommunications industry 
the decrease in the revenues from north american installation and replacement services were partially offset by a increase in revenues from north american cablecure injection services 
although injection services for florida power and light were down from the prior year  levels from other customers were up 
total cable injected in fiscal increased to miles compared to miles in revenue from the company s international operations increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal higher revenues from cablecure injection services in europe were partially offset by lower revenues from sales of flowmole drilling systems to international customers and drilling operations in the united kingdom 
demand for cablecure injection services increased as european utilities increased their acceptance of the cablecure technology and the company increased its marketing efforts 
sales opportunities to many customers in asia continued to be limited by weak economic conditions 
at the end of march  the company sold its uk drilling operation and has discontinued the sale of drilling systems in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to of total revenues in fiscal compared to of total revenues in fiscal during the second and third quarters of fiscal  gross profit decreased primarily due to the curtailment of work from florida power and light 
during this time  the company was able to redeploy certain crews  however  in anticipation of the resumption of work  overhead expenses in the florida operations centers were maintained 
in the fourth quarter of the year  work resumed for florida power and light under a new three year contract 
the slow startup under this contract continued to have a negative impact on gross margins in the fourth quarter 
contract pricing terms combined with difficult soils conditions on installation and replacement services for another major customer also had a negative effect on gross margin  however  more favorable contract terms with this customer were negotiated in the fourth quarter 
during  the company increased the reserves for inventory obsolescence and for insurance claims from prior years 
the company also accrued a charge of approximately  for a settlement of a legal dispute involving the pricing of services from a subcontractor 
the company experienced a higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue from its international operations in fiscal  increasing from in fiscal to in fiscal the company earned higher margins on the equipment sales it completed in fiscal furthermore  cablecure services in europe typically generate higher margins than other international revenues  and the increased mix of revenue from such services contributed to the improved gross profit percentage 
operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal  primarily due to one time charges associated with severance benefits for terminated employees and expenses related to the settlement of a legal dispute with a subcontractor 
sales and marketing expenses also increased as the company increased its resources to pursue further growth opportunities 
research and engineering expenses decreased compared to fiscal a lower level of spending on engineering activities associated with the company s drilling systems was the primary cause of the decrease 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported an operating loss of  in fiscal compared to an operating loss of  in fiscal other income and expense 
net interest expense was  in fiscal  compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal the increase was primarily a result of higher borrowing costs  higher average usage of the company s line of credit  and interest expenses on increased capital leases used to finance some of the company s purchases of new drilling equipment in fiscal income tax benefit 
the company had no federal or state income tax provision related to united states operations in fiscal due to realizing the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets 
the company did not record any income tax benefits against its pretax loss in fiscal  because the company was in a loss carryforward position at the beginning of fiscal  and continues to provide a valuation allowance against the full amount of its deferred tax assets as of march  on an ongoing basis  the company would typically expect an effective income tax rate of approximately due to state income taxes and the impact of nondeductible expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item net loss 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company recorded a net loss of  in fiscal compared to a net loss of  in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues increased approximately due to a increase in revenues from north american installation and replacement services and a increase in north american repair and restoration services  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from international operations 
total revenues from north american operations were million in fiscal revenues from electric utilities  gas utilities and telephone companies constituted  and  respectively of such fiscal revenues 
revenues from electric utilities increased substantially in fiscal  primarily from the company s largest customer  florida power light 
revenues from gas utilities also increased in fiscal primarily due to expansion on service capabilities to existing customers 
in march  due to issues associated with contract pricing and mix of work  the company terminated its contract with its largest gas utility customer  washington gas light company  which accounted for of consolidated revenues in fiscal revenues from north american installation and replacement services were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal increased replacement services for customers under test  treat or replace contracts  particularly florida power light  accounted for most of this increase 
the company ordered new equipment to add flowmole drilling systems to its north american operations from new vendors and began to receive deliveries in september the total number of drilling systems increased from at april  to at march  accordingly  the company substantially increased its capacity to perform installation and replacement services in response to increased customer demand 
the company also increased its capacity to perform traditional trenching services  but eliminated many of those crews in march due to termination of work with its largest gas utility customer 
the average price per foot charged for installation and replacement services increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting the increased difficulty of work performed  primarily attributed to performing a higher percentage of installation and replacement projects in extremely hard or rocky soil conditions 
unusually severe rains and thunderstorms in the southeastern united states  attributed to el nino weather patterns  adversely affected the company s revenues in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  the company s revenues from north american installation and replacement services decreased to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to million in the third quarter of fiscal  in spite of an increase in the number of crews available to work 
the increase in revenues from north american repair and restoration services resulted primarily from the addition of crews equipped to perform repair of faulted underground electric cables for florida power light  as well as increased levels of cablecure injection services for other customers 
total cable injected in fiscal increased to million feet  compared to million feet in fiscal revenue from the company s international operations decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal lower revenues from sales of flowmole drilling systems to international customers offset higher revenues from cablecure injection services in europe 
the company had substantially sold its inventory of drilling systems at the beginning of fiscal and did not begin to receive new drilling systems from its new vendors until september therefore  the company was limited in its ability to quote new systems for sale during the first two quarters of fiscal in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  sales opportunities to many customers in asia were limited by weak economic conditions 
demand for cablecure injection services increased as european utilities increased their acceptance of the cablecure technology and the company increased its marketing efforts 
gross profit 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to of total revenues in fiscal compared to of total revenues in fiscal during the first two quarters of fiscal  gross profit decreased due primarily to investment in employees and equipment to perform new services  including repair of faulted underground electric cables  and hiring and training new employees for flowmole crews in anticipation of the receipt of new drilling systems  which commenced in september also  changes in contract pricing and subsequent changes in the mix of work received from the company s largest gas utility customer produced a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
the company began to improve its gross profit in the third quarter of fiscal as new drilling equipment was placed into service  utilizing existing employees to form new crews  and the company renegotiated pricing on a number of contracts to increase gross profit 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company concentrated approximately three fourths of its crews in the southeastern united states 
the severe rains and thunderstorms in the region attributed to el nino adversely affected the crews ability to work 
accordingly  most of those crews lost approximately thirty percent of their available workdays 
the reduced revenues  coupled with an increased number of crews operating  substantially contributed to lower gross profit 
gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal was also adversely affected by costs to terminate the company s contracts with its largest gas utility customer 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company incurred higher than normal expenses for warranty costs  reserves for inventory obsolescence  and a write down of inventories of parts held for sale  which further reduced gross profit by approximately  the company experienced a higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue from its international operations in fiscal the company earned higher margins on the equipment sales it completed in fiscal also  cablecure services in europe typically generate higher margins than other international revenues  and the increased mix of revenue from such services contributed to the improved gross profit percentage in fiscal operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses  as the company increased its resources to pursue further growth opportunities 
in addition  the company incurred approximately  in expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the design of new enterprise wide computer software which was installed in the third quarter of fiscal research and engineering expenses decreased compared to fiscal lower levels of spending on the company s prototype series g drill than was incurred in fiscal was the primary cause of the decrease 
operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company reported an operating loss of  in fiscal compared to operating income of  in fiscal other income and expense 
net interest expense was  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  in fiscal as a result of higher average usage of the company s line of credit and interest expenses on capital leases used to finance some of the company s purchases of new drilling equipment in fiscal income tax benefit 
the company had no federal or state income tax provision related to united states operations in fiscal due to realizing the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets 
in addition  the company reported an  income tax benefit in fiscal due to additional refunds from prior years generated as a result of a favorable conclusion of an internal revenue service examination of its fiscal federal tax return 
also  the company recognized  in tax refunds associated with fiscal tax losses incurred by its european subsidiary 
the company did not record any income tax benefits against its pretax loss in fiscal because the company was in a loss carryforward position at the beginning of fiscal  and continues to provide a valuation allowance against the full amount of its deferred tax assets as of march  net loss 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company recorded a net loss of  in fiscal compared to net income of  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources since its initial public offering  the company has primarily financed its operations through cash flow from operations  cash reserves  leases and periodic use of its line of credit 
the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled  at march  during fiscal  the company incurred capital expenditures of approximately  primarily for upgrades and additions to its fleet of drilling equipment  purchases of conventional and other equipment required to respond to its customers requests for expanded service capabilities  and costs associated with the development and installation of a new enterprise wide information system 
the company expects to continue the use of its revolving credit facility to meet its short term financing needs  due to seasonal and other factors which impact the carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the company anticipates approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for upgrades to its fleet of drilling equipment  purchases of conventional and other equipment in order to respond to its customers requests for expanded service capabilities  and miscellaneous upgrades to its computer hardware and software 
the company relies on cash flow from operations and lease financing  in addition to its revolving credit facility  to fund operations 
the company believes that its revolving credit facility and leasing arrangements  together with cash flow from operations  will be adequate to meet its financing needs for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that such facilities will continue to be available on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
the company s financial performance will be a key factor in determining the availability of such facilities 
if such facilities became unavailable to the company  or if the company is required to seek additional capital to fund anticipated growth  the company would be required to seek other sources of public or private capital 
there can be no assurance that adequate funds will be available to the company through such sources when needed or will be available on terms favorable to the company 
if at any time the company is unable to obtain sufficient funds  the company will be required to restrict or eliminate plans for expansion and other aspects of its operations 
at march   the company had an available bank line of credit of  and an outstanding balance on the facility of  on april   the company closed a new  two year  revolving credit facility with finova capital corporation for  the facility is secured primarily by the assets of the company

the company currently owns equipment to field flowmole systems and conventional trenching crews 
the company typically plans for excess equipment to allow time for preventive maintenance  matching of equipment to job types  mobilization time  or other equipment downtime factors 
the company expects to acquire significant amounts of conventional trenching equipment in fiscal  but may also use short term rentals to supplement its equipment needs until it chooses to acquire new or used equipment of its own 
the company currently plans to increase its personnel to add additional installation and replacement capabilities in fiscal however  the company s revenue levels  and the weighted average number of crews in operation on any given day  will be affected by various factors  including weather  pricing  competition  customer work release practices  soil  permitting and other work difficulty determinants 
see also the discussion under utilities budgetary considerations  competition and seasonal factors included under important risk factors regarding forward looking statements  below 
cablecure services 
the company expects a continuation of the trend towards increased customer acceptance of the cablecure process aided by a new year warranty  sales incentive structure and increased marketing 
the company anticipates that the trend towards lower pricing for cable replacement will continue to place downward pressure on the price for cablecure services 
see competition under part i  item i 
the company s seven largest cablecure customers account for over of consolidated cablecure revenues 
the company expects to see increased volumes from new customers in fiscal and some increased volumes from existing customers  but expects to continue to be dependent upon a small number of customers 
the company s goal is to reduce this dependency through growth 
because the company s customers can typically cancel their work on short notice  a certain degree of uncertainty always exists in the company s future revenue levels 
see also the discussion under utilities budgetary considerations  competition  seasonal factors and dow corning corporation included under important risk factors regarding forward looking statements  below 
international operations 
the company intends to emphasize its cablecure service in future international operations 
although it continues to support customers with the sale of spare parts  the company has discontinued the sales of new drilling equipment overseas for fiscal cablecure services in europe have been concentrated in germany and austria 
the company also has current licensees operating in korea and scandinavia 
international cablecure revenue levels  primarily from german operations  were approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal the company is in the process of adding personnel to support expected growth in european cablecure services 
customer acceptance of the cablecure process  however  is proceeding slowly in europe  as it did in past years in the united states 
the company plans to continue expanding its sales efforts throughout europe and asia 
the company operated five drilling crews in the united kingdom in fiscal and revenues from drilling operations in the united kingdom were and of revenue from international operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
on march   the company sold its drilling operation in the uk to a customer for cash totaling approximately  the company recorded a gain on sale of approximately  related to this sale 
the company will maintain spare parts sales to europe  asia and south america 
spare parts sales accounted for and of revenue from international operations in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
operating expenses 
the company anticipates that its current staffing levels can support the planned growth in the company s operations for fiscal  and accordingly expects operating expenses to remain relatively stable in fiscal the company has begun contacting its major vendors and customers to obtain their assurance that systems affecting the company are year compliant 
to date  the company is unaware of any situations of noncompliance that would adversely affect its operations 
the company has also analyzed its equipment and its operations and has not identified any processes that depend upon software that is date sensitive or otherwise subject to risks associated with the year see also discussion of capital expenditures under liquidity and capital resources  above 
the company is required to pay a royalty to dow corning based on the net profits from worldwide cablecure services  as defined in the underlying exclusive license agreement 
the level of such provisions for royalty expenditures will increase from fiscal levels if the projections for increasing levels of cablecure revenues are achieved 
in addition  based on historical results and laboratory tests  a new year warranty to be offered to customers in fiscal is not expected to increase the warranty expense associated with cablecure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item capital expenditures and other matters 
the company expects to continue to require substantial levels of capital spending 
in fiscal  capital spending will emphasize the upgrading of existing field power units to support existing drills units  the purchase of additional conventional equipment  such as backhoes  to support customer requirements for increased turnkey capabilities and the continued upgrade of computer hardware and software 
impact of inflation and changing prices 
inflation has had only a minimal effect on the company s revenues and expenses and is not expected to have a significant impact on revenues or expenses in fiscal important risk factors regarding forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements on which the company relies in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements utilities budgetary considerations 
budgetary considerations  arising from unfavorable regulatory determinations on matters such as rate setting  capitalization of services performed by the company  approval of mergers and acquisitions  siting of power production facilities  reductions in new housing starts or electric utility revenues due to mild weather  and general economic downturns have affected the ability of some of the company s utility customers to sustain their cable replacement or other maintenance programs 
this has had an adverse impact on the company s revenues and profits 
although the company has broadened its customer base  one particular customer generates approximately of the company s consolidated revenues  and seven customers generate over of consolidated cablecure revenues 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item because cable replacement  restoration  and other maintenance programs are  to a substantial extent  deferrable and the company s contracts with its utility customers permit termination of orders on relatively short notice  postponement or cancellation of such programs by customers can subject the company s revenues and profits to substantial volatility 
competition 
the company has experienced a long term trend of declining prices for trenchless drilling services  particularly for smaller diameter utility installations  due to competitive pressures and changes in utility bidding practices 
this trend has also caused the company to lower its prices for cablecure injection services  which are priced at a discount to replacement costs  including replacement via guided boring 
in addition  the company s utility customers are increasing their requests for turnkey installation  replacement  and restoration services  requiring their drilling contractors to take responsibility for switching circuits  terminating circuits  and other non incidental tasks 
these tasks require additional equipment and labor  and the cost increases can offset any price increase the company is able to negotiate for the expansion of its services 
these trends are expected to continue and the company cannot predict the ultimate duration or the magnitude of these decreases 
seasonal factors 
weather and other seasonal factors may cause a decrease in the company s revenues and profits in any given period 
adverse weather may preclude the company from operating its flowmole drilling systems or providing its cablecure services at certain times of the year 
such factors had a severe impact on the company s operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the company believes that the regular budgetary cycles of certain of its north american utility customers tend to concentrate demand for the company s services during the third quarter of its fiscal year the fourth quarter of the calendar year  although other budgetary factors described below may override this trend in any given quarter 
as a result of these factors  results of operations in any given fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results in any other fiscal quarter 
management of growth 
there can be no assurance that the company s systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s operations as they expand 
any future growth will impose significant additional responsibilities on members of senior management  including the need to identify  recruit  and integrate new senior level managers and executives 
to the extent that the company is unable to manage its growth efficiently and effectively  or is unable to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
availability of qualified employees 
the company s ability to provide high quality services on a timely basis requires an adequate supply of skilled laborers  equipment operators  journeymen linemen  and project managers 
accordingly  the company s ability to increase its productivity and profitability will be limited by its ability to employ  train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet the company s requirements 
many companies in the company s industry are currently experiencing shortages of qualified personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently  that the company s labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel  or that the company will not have to curtail its planned internal growth as a result of labor shortages 
dow corning corporation 
the company purchases its cablecure fluid exclusively from dow corning 
in may  dow corning filed for protection under chapter while the company has been informed by dow corning that it intends to continue the cablecure business  there can be no assurance that dow corning or the bankruptcy court will not take action to amend or terminate the cablecure license agreement 
see the discussion under the cablecure service in part i  item foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s financial results are affected by fluctuations in certain foreign currencies  particularly the exchange rate between the british pound sterling  the german deutschmark and the euro 
such fluctuations could result in material adverse adjustments to the carrying values of accounts receivable or other assets measured in foreign currencies  or on the reported results of operations of the company s european operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item year risk factors 
significant uncertainty exists concerning the potential costs and effects associated with year compliance 
any year compliance problem of either the company or its major vendors and customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
year data conversion 
the year issue is the result of computer programs having been written using two digits  rather than four  to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computers  computer programs  manufacturing and administration equipment or construction equipment used by its crews that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if any of the company s systems or equipment that have date sensitive software use only two digits  system failures or miscalculations may result causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions with third parties or engage in similar normal business activities 
during  the company initiated a project to address the year issue that encompasses operating and administrative areas of the company 
in addition  executive management regularly monitors the status of the company s year remediation plans 
the process includes an assessment of issues and development of remediation plans  where necessary  as they relate to internally used software  computer hardware  and use of computer applications in the company s processes and products 
in addition  the company is engaged in assessing the year issue with significant customers and suppliers 
internal infrastructure 
the company has determined that its propriety equipment used by flowmole and cablecure crews does not rely on date sensitive software 
the company believes that it has identified substantially all of the major computers  software applications  and related equipment used in connection with is internal operations that must be modified  upgraded  or replaced to minimize the possibility of a material disruption to its business 
the company has completed the process of replacing systems that have been identified as adversely affected 
on november   the company converted its enterprise wide information systems to newly installed software certified by the vendor to be year compliant 
systems other than information technology systems 
in addition to computers and related systems  the operation of office and facilities equipment  such as fax machines  photocopiers  telephone switches  security systems  elevators  and other common devices may be affected by the year problem 
the company is currently assessing the potential effect of  and costs of remediating  the year problem on its office and facilities equipment 
the company estimates the total cost to the company of completing any required modifications  upgrades  or replacements of these other internal systems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
this estimate is being monitored and will be revised as additional information becomes available 
customers 
the company is preparing to implement a communications plan with its customers to attempt to identify and resolve  if possible  issues associated with the year if the company s customers are unable to resolve year issues  those customers could have difficulty preparing new work packages for issuance to the company or approving and paying invoices for the company s services 
the company s revenues and cash flows from operations could be severely affected as a result 
the company s customers primarily consist of large utility companies who are expending substantial resources to solve year problems 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to determine if its customers have year problems that will affect the company 
also  even if such problems are identified  the company may not be able to influence its customers to prioritize a timely solution to year problems that are identified 
any failure of customers to resolve year issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
suppliers 
the company has initiated communications with third party suppliers of the products and financial services used  operated  or maintained by the company to identify and  to the extent possible  to resolve issues involving the year problem 
the company believes that its major suppliers are adequately addressing their year exposure 
however  the company has limited or no control over the actions of these third party suppliers 
thus  while the company expects that it will be able to resolve any significant year problems with these systems before the occurrence of a material disruption to the business of the company or any of its customers  any failure of these third parties to resolve year problems with their systems in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
most likely consequences of year problems 
the company expects to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially adversely affect its business operations 
however  management believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting the company have been identified or corrected 
the number of devices that could be affected and the interactions among these devices are simply too numerous 
in addition  one cannot accurately predict how many year problem related failures will occur or the severity  duration  or financial consequences of potential failures 
as a result  management expects that the company could likely suffer the following consequences a significant number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for the company and its clients that may divert management s time and attention and financial and human resources from its ordinary business activities  and a lesser number of serious system failures that may require significant efforts by the company s customers to prevent or alleviate material business disruptions 
contingency plans 
the company is currently developing contingency plans to be implemented as part of its efforts to identify and correct year problems affecting its customers or major vendors 
the company expects to complete its contingency plans by september  these plans could include increased work hours for company personnel or use of contract personnel to provide manual workaround solutions for customer work release systems or invoice approval processes  and similar approaches 
if the company is required to implement any of these contingency plans  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations
