item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal and revenues the company s total revenues for fiscal were  compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal product revenues 
sales of lasercard r optical memory cards and related products totaled  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the increases in product revenues over these periods were due primarily to the sale of border crossing cards laser visa cards for a us department of state application and permanent resident cards green cards for the us immigration and naturalization service ins 
the company s card shipments to all customers totaled approximately million optical memory cards in fiscal  million cards in fiscal  and  cards in fiscal applications for the company s lasercard products include medical data applications in the united states  various programs in europe and asia  including a hospital patient record card system and a vehicle warranty and maintenance records card  and us government related programs  including the us department of defense automated manifest card  the ins green card  and the us department of state laser visa card 
in fiscal  the company sold lasercard products or provided services to approximately customers in six states and foreign countries 
in addition to using its own marketing staff  the company utilizes value added reseller var companies and licensees for the development of commercial markets and applications for lasercard products 
product sales to vars and licensees include the company s optical memory cards  the company s system software  and optical card reader writers made by a licensee of the company  and may include add on peripherals made by other companies such as equipment for adding a digitized photo  fingerprint  hand template  or signature to the cards 
the vars licensees may add application software  personal computers pcs  and other peripherals  and then resell these products  integrated into data systems  for end user customers 
there can be no assurances that any new or existing var or licensee company in any country will be successful in its markets or that it will place follow on orders with the company for additional quantities of cards and systems 
in order to upgrade its customer base to increase the probability of success  the company will continue its efforts to recruit new vars licensees and eliminate nonproductive vars 
the company provides customer technical support and system software to assist vars and licensees 
software is an important factor in developing the commercial markets for optical memory cards 
the company s system software consists of optical card interface software device drivers  file systems  software development tools  and demonstration software 
the company s vars and or their customers develop software for specific end user applications 
several vars have written optical card software programs for applications such as automobile warranty and maintenance records  cargo manifesting  digital optical key systems  admissions id  data logging systems  and various medical related applications such as medical image storage and health history cards 
the company recently finished development of a complete card issuing application  done in coordination with an existing commercial software company 
this is now offered for sale to all vars and should greatly reduce the need for vars to develop their own personalization software 
optical memory cards are used in conjunction with a card reader writer device that connects to a personal computer pc 
the reader writer is integrated as a pc logical drive and has drive letter access in the same manner as floppy disk drives 
reader writers are sold to vars licensees and other customers of the company 
the price  performance  and availability of reader writers are factors in the commercialization of optical cards 
the company sells reader writers for a few thousand dollars per unit  and these units generally include the company s interface software device drivers 
prior to and during fiscal  the company purchased reader writers from a japanese licensee  nippon conlux co  ltd  conlux  which was the company s sole supplier of reader writers 
on may   arrangements were completed with conlux for the company to purchase sets of parts to assemble reader writers in the united states  rather than continuing to purchase complete reader writers assembled in japan by conlux 
the launching of this reader writer manufacturing and development operation in a  square foot  leased facility  with added staff  is estimated to reduce net income during fiscal by million  or cents per share  for occupancy related expenses  depreciation  amortization  salaries and fringe benefits  and certain one time expenditures estimated at  for reader writer assembly training 
investment in reader writer related inventory is estimated at million  and capital expenditures for reader writer assembly and design are budgeted for approximately million in fiscal  including an estimated  in capitalized technology transfer costs to be amortized over three years 
the company is also obligated to pay a running patent royalty on its sales of reader writers 
the company assumed world wide responsibility for all repair and maintenance of conlux reader writer units in and has a highly skilled technical staff to support this function 
the company maintains an inventory of reader writers that it believes is adequate to meet customer demand 
if demand increases sharply over a short period of time  an initial shortage of reader writers could result 
also  an interruption or change in the supply of reader writer parts could cause a delay in both reader writer and optical memory card shipments and a possible loss of sales  which would adversely affect operating results 
workstation revenues 
the company recorded revenues of  in fiscal for the delivery of six prototype multi technology card readers multi technology card workstations for an existing customer 
these multi technology card workstations can write and or read cards that have one or more of the following technologies optical memory stripe  ic chip  magnetic stripe  ocr b optical character recognition  and dimensional bar code 
costs for the development and manufacture of these workstations were charged to cost of sales 
there were no revenues of this type in fiscal or fiscal license revenues 
revenues from license fees were  for fiscal and  for fiscal there were no license fee revenues for fiscal fiscal license revenues included  from an agreement to provide technical information and  which together with a prior year payment completed the purchase of a nonexclusive license for optical memory card distribution 
optical memory card distribution licenses grant the right to purchase cards at the company s most favorable pricing 
fiscal license revenue included  from the sale of a patent license 
license fees received by the company are unconditional and nonrefundable  and no significant obligations remain unfulfilled by the company under any of its licenses 
the company does not rely on license fees to finance operations 
royalty revenues 
royalty revenues were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the company cannot predict whether or when equipment or card sales by its licensees will result in material royalties to the company 
therefore  the company is not relying on royalty income and does not expect it to be a significant factor in the near term 
backlog as of march   the backlog for lasercard optical memory cards was approximately million 
a million order for optical memory cards was received by the company about six weeks later  for us department of state laser visa cards and ins green cards 
margins the gross margin on product sales for fiscal was compared with for fiscal and for fiscal  due largely to the increase in card sales volume 
the gross margin can fluctuate with changes in product mix between cards and card reader writer equipment  which has lower gross profit margins than cards 
therefore  the gross margin percentage next year could decrease if a greater proportion of product sales comes from reader writer equipment than at present and due to the startup of reader writer assembly activities 
income and expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses were  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the increases for fiscal and versus prior years are due mainly to higher expenses for payroll  marketing  and customer technical support activities 
sg a expenses will grow in fiscal compared with fiscal  due to increases in direct marketing by the company and expenses related to the start up of reader writer assembly  as discussed above 
research and engineering expenses 
research and engineering expenses were  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the expense reduction for compared with was due primarily to accounting for facility costs rather than a reduction in research and engineering activities 
the optical memory card facility is used for both engineering and manufacturing 
therefore  the facility costs depreciation expense  building lease payments  and other costs are allocated between manufacturing and engineering based upon the level of activity in the respective areas 
substantially all of these expenses were allocated to card production during fiscal and because of the substantial increase in card production for customer orders 
during fiscal  approximately of these expenses were allocated to card production 
the company continues to undertake ongoing research and engineering project activities related to optical memory cards and associated equipment 
future projects will require increased spending as the optical card industry grows 
the company anticipates increased research and engineering spending in fiscal for optical memory card reader writer development  as discussed above 
other income and expense 
total net other income for fiscal was  compared with  for fiscal and  for fiscal the company purchases japanese yen for payment of reader writers purchased from a japanese supplier 
equipment delivery dates and payment dates do not coincide 
thus  the company s normal operations are subject to gains or losses on fluctuations in the yen dollar exchange rate 
net other income included a loss of  on foreign currency exchange for fiscal versus a  gain for fiscal and a  gain for fiscal interest income was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal the changes in interest income for each year were due generally to changes in average invested funds 
the company s interest expense on short term loans was  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  a current ratio of to  and no long term debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal compared with  used for operating activities for fiscal and  used for operating activities for fiscal the fiscal change in comparison with fiscal and was due mainly to the increase in card sales 
the current level of revenues is sufficient to generate cash from operations after expenses 
fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities will use cash in some quarters and provide cash in other quarters 
losses would recur if both of the company s largest us government programs were to be canceled or not renewed and not be replaced by other card orders 
the company has not established a line of credit and has no current plans to do so 
the company may negotiate a line of credit if and when it becomes appropriate  although no assurance can be made that such financing would be available  if needed 
as a result of the  profit recorded for fiscal  the company s accumulated deficit was reduced to  at march  during fiscal  stockholders equity increased to  because of the  profit and  received by the company for stock issued during fiscal under the employee stock purchase plan and the stock option plan 
the company s total deferred income tax asset was  at march  if utilized  the total deferred income tax asset would reduce future tax expense on the profit and loss statement by  and would reduce future tax payments by  included are amounts derived from federal income tax net operating losses that will expire at various dates from through  amounts from state income tax net operating losses that will expire in  and amounts from tax credit carryforwards that will expire at various dates from through  except for alternative minimum tax credits which have no expiration 
the ability of the company to utilize this deferred tax asset is contingent upon generating sufficient income within the stated time periods 
because it is uncertain that the total deferred tax asset will be realized  the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against it  therefore  no part of the total deferred tax asset of  has been added to stockholders equity on the company s balance sheet 
for the production of state of the art optical memory cards  the company s card production capacity exceeds million cards per year 
this capacity can be expanded to a production capacity exceeding million cards per year over a six month period with an expenditure of approximately million  previously budgeted for this purpose 
the company plans to purchase additional production equipment in a series of steps as optical memory card orders expand to justify production capacity increases  to a rate of up to million cards per year 
in addition to the investment used for expansion  the company also will make additional capital expenditures for cost savings  quality improvements  and other purposes 
the company believes that during the next few years  capital expenditures would be a minimum of million per year for card production equipment and automatic inspection equipment 
in addition  the company s plans for fiscal include approximately million in equipment and other capital expenditures for reader writer assembly and design  as discussed above 
during fiscal  company employees and consultants purchased from the company  shares of registered common stock  at an average price of per share  through the exercise of stock options under the company s stock option plan  which resulted in cash receipts to the company of  optionees are permitted to exercise company stock options using shares they already own 
during fiscal  optionees surrendered  previously owned shares to purchase  new shares through the exercise of stock options 
as of march   company employees and consultants held unexercised  vested  in the money options to purchase  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share  for a weighted average of per share 
these stock options  if exercised with cash  would provide the company with cash in the amount of  forward looking statements certain statements made in this report relating to plans  objectives  and economic performance go beyond historical information and may provide an indication of future results 
to that extent  they are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and each is subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward looking statement 
in particular  the ability of the company to maintain a profitable level of optical memory card sales is subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to to changes in technology  customer diversification  customer expansion  the ability to economically produce optical card reader writers  the implementation of ongoing commercial applications by customers  and the economic configuration and operation of the company s card manufacturing facility for increased output levels 
such factors are described above  in the narrative section of this form k  and in other documents filed by the company from time to time with the securities and exchange commission
