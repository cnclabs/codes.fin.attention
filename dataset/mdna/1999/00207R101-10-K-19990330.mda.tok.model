atmi participates in united states government funded research and development contracts through its ventures division 
the technologies business contributed approximately of consolidated revenues in results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of total revenues percentage of total revenues fiscal year ended december  product revenues contract revenues total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general  and administrative non recurring expenses total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net other income  net income before income taxes and minority interest income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income comparison of fiscal years ended december    and revenues 
revenues decreased to million in from million in  following an increase of in from million in product revenues decreased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in soft market conditions in  evidenced by a decline in semiconductor unit demand in the second and third quarters of and a significant reduction in semiconductor equipment spending during most of  were the primary causes of the revenue decline when comparing with the growth in revenues from to was driven primarily by a substantial increase in sds product sales  increased market penetration within most product lines  and healthy overall growth in the semiconductor industry in contract revenues decreased to million  or of total revenues  in from million  or of total revenues  in  and decreased in from million in  or of total revenues 
the decline in and as compared to the previous years resulted from a general decrease in government funding of the company s contract research activities  reflecting the completion of certain contract research programs and the company s decision to focus on research relating to more specific  commercially relevant efforts 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margin decreased to of revenues in from of revenues in gross margin on product revenues decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of less efficient fixed cost absorption attendant to the decrease in revenues experienced in  particularly within the ecosys  epitronics  and now businesses 
gross margin on contract revenues increased to in from in the increase in contract margins resulted from the completion of various firm fixed price contracts during gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margin decreased to of revenues in from of revenues in gross margin on product revenues decreased to in from in the decrease of product margins was primarily attributable to lower margins in the silicon epi business because of the relocation of manufacturing equipment during the first half of and duplicate facility costs during that period 
additionally  margin decreases were caused by lower selling prices to end user customers of adcs and the fact that the sds revenue stream was a smaller but higher margin royalty stream in margin decreases were partially offset by the improved margin profile of the overall product mix of ecosys in gross margin on contract revenues decreased to in from in contract margins varied slightly when comparing the two periods due to different fee arrangements and indirect cost absorption 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the increase was primarily due to the development efforts to extend the sds technology beyond ion implant applications into cvd  etch  and bulk gas delivery  and product development activities within the company s emosyn division 
the increase was primarily due to increased staffing for several development efforts related to the company s advanced thin film technology and applications 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in  compared with in  which was a decrease from in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction of administrative costs resulting from reductions in personnel  a decrease in executive compensation  and decreased commissions on lower product revenues 
atmi s variable selling costs grew in in line with the company s revenue growth from levels 
atmi also added administrative staff in as compared to  to support revenue growth  and incurred increased costs related to the businesses acquired in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in  compared with in and in non recurring expenses 
the and operating results included a one time  non recurring charge of million and million  respectively  related to the costs incurred in completing the now acquisition in and the adcs group and lsl acquisitions in the operating results included a one time charge of million in connection with patent litigation involving lsl  which resulted in a settlement payment in may additionally  in the third quarter of  the company recorded approximately  of non recurring charges related to workforce reductions in the ecosys business  which was recorded in non recurring charges  and an increase of approximately  in general business reserves  deemed necessary by the weakness in the semiconductor industry in  which was recorded in cost of sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses 
interest income expense  net 
interest income increased to million in from million in  and decreased in from million in the increase in interest income is a direct result of the increased cash and marketable securities that resulted from the company s public offering in the first quarter of the decrease in interest income in was due to lower levels of cash on hand from the acquisition cost of adcs and lsl in the fourth quarter of interest expense decreased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the decrease was due to lower debt balances outstanding during  as capital lease lines were paid down and certain high interest rate debt was retired 
interest expense was higher in than  due primarily to increased borrowings under capital lease lines 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the effective income tax rate decreased to in from in  and increased from in atmi s income tax expense related to united states federal and state taxes in  which was partially offset by various foreign sales corporation benefits  and research and development credits 
the effective tax rate was increased by no tax benefit being taken for the non recurring charge of million related to the now acquisition 
the significant increase in to a level above statutory rates was due in part to the operating results including the million non recurring charge related to the adcs group and lsl acquisitions for which no tax benefit was taken 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the interest held by kc tech co  ltd 
kc tech in the operations of adcs korea a south korean chusik hoesa  which is a joint venture established to manufacture  sell  and distribute chemicals to the semiconductor and related industries in south korea 
earnings per share 
earnings per share  on a diluted basis  remained constant at per share in and  a decline from per share in however  after adjusting earnings to exclude the non recurring and one time charges recognized in   and  and to adjust earnings on a pro forma basis to treat the adcs group as a c corporation for all of  earnings per share  on a diluted basis  decreased to per share in from per share in  and increased in from per share in basic earnings per share decreased to per share in from per share in  and decreased in from per share in segment data during  the company adopted fasb statement no 
disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
atmi has two segments atmi materials and atmi technologies 
atmi materials  which consists of the adcs  novasource  and now divisions  develops and markets ultrahigh purity thin film materials and proprietary delivery systems 
atmi technologies consists of the ecosys  epitronics  emosyn  and venture divisions 
ecosys is a provider of point of use environmental equipment offering all of the key technologies for semiconductor effluent abatement 
epitronics is involved in specialty epitaxial services  providing high quality processing of silicon  and next generation iii v and wide bandgap  wafers 
emosyn is bringing to market a new generation of semiconductor devices  initially targeted at the high growth market for smart card integrated circuits 
atmi participates in united states government funded research and development contracts through its ventures division 
the company has a corporate headquarters  which is not a separate operating unit 
activity of the corporate headquarters has been classified in corporate listed below 
the reportable segments are each managed separately because they manufacture and distribute distinct products with different production processes 
the company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on operating profit or loss  not including interest and other income or expense and income taxes 
the accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in atmi s consolidated financial statements 
intercompany sales are not material among segments or operating divisions 
the general corporate assets include primarily cash and marketable securities  goodwill  and other long lived assets of the company 
the following tables provide reported results for each of these segments revenues atmi materials    atmi technologies    consolidated revenues    operating income loss atmi materials    atmi technologies    non recurring charges    corporate    consolidated operating income    identifiable assets atmi materials    atmi technologies    general corporate assets    total consolidated assets    consolidated net income operating income from reportable segments    other profit or loss    income taxes provision    consolidated net income    business segments results atmi materials overall revenues in the materials segment in declined from levels  which had increased from levels 
a decline in semiconductor unit demand during the second and third quarters of slowed sales of many of atmi materials product offerings 
during the fourth quarter  semiconductor unit demand began to rebound and caused sequential revenue growth in the materials segment 
the materials revenue growth was spurred by strong industry conditions and significant market penetration  particularly related to the sds and now product lines 
operating income in the materials segment declined in from levels  which had increased from levels 
the revenue decline in reduced gross margins within the segment and drove the operating income decline 
alternatively  the revenue growth in when compared to  increased gross margins and generated higher operating profitability 
operating income  as a percentage of revenues  was   and for   and  respectively 
atmi technologies overall net revenues in the technologies segment in declined from levels  which had increased from levels 
semiconductor manufacturing capacity expansion came to a virtual standstill in early which caused a significant decline in revenues within the ecosys and epitronics businesses 
although signs of a slow steady recovery have emerged in early  utilization of existing manufacturing capacity must increase significantly before substantial capacity expansion occurs 
government contract revenues also declined in due to the completion of various programs in the revenue growth of ecosys and epitronics was partially offset by a decline in contract revenues 
operating income within the technologies segment declined to a loss in based on the decline in ecosys operating results to below break even levels  and the significantly increased research and development efforts focused on the company s emosyn business and other new business ventures 
epitronics profitability also declined in by virtue of revenue declines on a relatively fixed cost base 
in  the increased operating income generated through the growth of the ecosys and epitronics businesses were offset by reduced profitability on government contracts and incremental investment in the emosyn venture 
corporate corporate expenses continued to increase in from and  due to the overall increase in general and administrative support in and the growth of the company  driven by three acquisitions in the last five quarters  has required additional corporate infrastructure 
the corporate expenses increased in from  which had increased from levels 
corporate identifiable assets consist primarily of cash and marketable securities 
liquidity and capital resources to date  the company has financed its activities through the sale of equity  its operations  external research and development funding  and various lease and debt instruments 
the company s working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  in  operations provided cash of approximately million 
the million of non recurring transaction costs  expensed in the third quarter of  reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  as approximately million remained unpaid at december  net cash generated from operations in was approximately million 
working capital increases  most notably in accounts receivable  inventory  and other assets  resulted in significant uses of cash in the million of non recurring transaction costs  expensed in the fourth quarter of  reduced the cash generated from operations by approximately million  as approximately million remain unpaid at december  in  atmi generated net cash from operations of million  primarily due to the profitability of operations 
the company s investing activities included capital expenditures of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the expenditures primarily related to installation of additional manufacturing capacity in danbury  connecticut  san jose  california  and in burnet  texas 
the expenditures included both the installation of sds manufacturing capacity in the danbury  connecticut facility and an increase in epitaxial capacity in epitronics arizona facilities 
capital expenditures for included final construction of epitronics manufacturing facility in mesa  arizona  as well as manufacturing expansion for ecosys and adcs korea  and laboratory construction for customer application work for ecosys 
among other investing activities  the company invested approximately million raised primarily from the sale of its common stock into marketable securities for future working capital requirements and potential merger and acquisition activities 
the company sold million in marketable securities  net in  while in  atmi sold million in marketable securities  net and made a million payment in connection with the acquisition of the guardian systems product line 
as of december   atmi has financed a significant portion of its capital equipment purchases  particularly the silicon epitaxial capacity  through capital leases with approximately million of capital lease obligations outstanding 
during  the company made payments on capital leases of approximately million 
financial institutions have also provided collateral based loans for other equipment purchases 
during  the company made payments on notes of approximately million  with the most significant payment being the mortgage on the mesa  arizona epitronics facility 
the company s now business has an industrial revenue bond arrangement outstanding in the amount of million  which was used for equipment and improvements at its manufacturing facility and corporate office 
at december   million of loans  bonds  and financing remained outstanding 
management believes that its debt service obligations can be adequately satisfied by cash flows from operations 
atmi believes its existing cash balances  marketable securities  existing sources of liquidity  and anticipated funds from operations  including those of the newly acquired businesses  will satisfy its projected working capital and other cash requirements through at least the end of however  atmi believes the level of financing resources available to it is an important competitive factor in its industry and may seek additional capital prior to the end of that period 
additionally  atmi considers  on a continuing basis  potential acquisitions of technologies and businesses complementary to its current business 
there are no present agreements with respect to any such acquisitions 
however  any such transactions may affect atmi s future capital needs 
operations outside the united states in the years ended december    and  sales outside the united states  including asia and europe  accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s revenues 
the company anticipates its sales outside the united states will continue to account for significant percentage of its revenues 
in addition  the company has a joint venture agreement with kc tech pursuant to which it has a interest in adcs korea  a south korean chusik hoesa  which manufactures  sells  and distributes thin film materials to the semiconductor and related industries in south korea 
year compliance atmi has formed an internal compliance team to evaluate its internal information technology infrastructure and application systems it systems and other non it infrastructure systems non it systems to determine whether such systems will operate correctly with regard to the import  export  and processing of date information  including correct handling of leap years  in connection with the change in the calendar year from to the year issue  and to evaluate the year issue with respect to the systems of third party partners and suppliers with which the company has a material relationship third party systems 
atmi has completed an it systems inventory analysis and risk assessment 
as previously planned and budgeted  the company is actively upgrading its core it systems to incorporate additional desired features and functionality including year compliant operators 
atmi has completed these upgrades 
in connection with such upgrades  the company expects its core it systems will be year compliant 
the company does not expect that any additional costs of addressing the year issue for its it systems will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations or cash flows 
atmi has also completed a non it system inventory analysis and risk assessment 
as a result of the analysis  no remediation actions were required in order to be year compliant 
because atmi believes the number of non it systems is relatively small and therefore  does not expect that any additional costs of addressing the year issue for non it systems will have a material adverse impact on its operations or its financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
atmi is in the process of completing a third party inventory and risk assessment 
atmi expects to verify year compliance of third party systems no later than june  atmi believes the number of material third party systems is relatively small 
however  until year compliance of all third party systems is ascertained and written assurances are received  the risk to atmi s operations and any additional costs relating to such third party systems is unknown 
atmi believes that its most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios would involve third party systems rather than its internal systems 
the company believes that its greatest risks would be the partial or complete shutdown of a critical supplier or strategic partner and its inability to provide critical supplies and services to the company on a timely basis 
a contingency plan addressing potential issues related to third party systems has been developed 
the contingency plan consists of ensuring adequate levels of critical supplies used in the company s manufacturing processes are on hand at the end of year the company has also compiled a listing of manufacturers of alternative supply sources for its critical products 
in the event a third party supplier is affected by year issues the company is making arrangements with alternative suppliers for its critical raw materials 
atmi has tested its products for year compliance and has determined that all atmi products currently available for sale have either successfully passed year compliance testing or are not subject to year compliance because such products do not import  export  or process date information in any manner 
for the year ending december   the company has incurred approximately  of expense relating to inventory analysis and risk assessment 
the funds to cover the cost incurred to date were derived from general operations 
the costs primarily relate to desktop compliance and standardization to year compliance 
these year expenditures are within the company s planned organizational budgets and include the cost of reviewing of key operating systems 
the remaining planned expenditures for year relate primarily to third party system reviews and internal resources working on the year issue as well as planned upgrades or planned replacement systems which will have a positive impact on resolving the year issue 
atmi expects the cost related to the third party systems compliance to be minimal 
as of december   no it systems projects have been deferred because of problems associated with the year issue
