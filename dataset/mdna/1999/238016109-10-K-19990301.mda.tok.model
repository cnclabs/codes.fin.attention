the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the financial statements of the company  which present the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
for the periods presented prior to the distribution date  the historical financial statements include the assets  liabilities  income and expenses that were directly related to the contributed businesses as they were operated within parent 
in the case of assets and liabilities not specifically allocable to any particular business of parent  only those assets and liabilities owned by the company after the distribution were included in the company s separate balance sheets 
regardless of the allocation of these assets and liabilities  however  the company s statement of operations includes all of the related costs of doing business  including charges for the use of facilities and for employee benefits  and includes an allocation of certain general corporate expenses of parent which were not directly related to the contributed businesses  including costs for corporate logistics  corporate research and development  information technologies  finance  legal and corporate executives 
these allocations were based on a number of factors including  for example  personnel  space  time and effort  and sales volume 
management believes these allocations as well as the assumptions underlying the development of the company s separate financial statements to be reasonable 
the consolidated financial statements for all periods subsequent to the distribution date reflect the results of operations  financial position  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of the independent company 
the financial information included herein for periods prior to the distribution date may not  however  necessarily reflect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company as it would have been had the company been a separate  stand alone entity during these periods 
this is due  in part  to the historical operation of the company as an integral part of the larger parent 
following the distribution  the company became a stand alone entity with objectives and strategies separate from those of parent

sales from these products were adversely impacted by various market conditions including a continued shift in the product markets toward new  lower priced hardware and software solutions particularly in pc prices  competitive pricing pressures and the decline of the worldwide financial markets 
sales from the company s commercial product  broadway  decreased approximately  or from the comparable period in fiscal primarily due to lower international sales 
gross margin for the period ended november  was of net sales compared to of net sales for the same period in the prior year 
the slight increase in gross margin was primarily the result of lower overall manufacturing overhead expenses  offset partially by lower overhead absorption due to decreased production levels as well as lower average selling prices

this decline was partially offset by sales from the company s broadway products which were  in fiscal compared to  in the prior year 
gross margin for the period ended november  was of net sales compared to of net sales for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of lower average selling prices in the data acquisition and imaging product lines  under utilization of the company s manufacturing capacity  as well as an increase in sales from the broadway products which carry a lower margin than the data acquisition and imaging products 
loss from operations for fiscal was  compared to a loss of  for the same period in the prior year

prior to the distribution date  the company filed its tax return as part of a consolidated group with parent 
the offsetting charge for the tax benefit has been included as an element of parent s net investment in the company as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders investment

year compliance disclosure year definition the year problem refers to computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  and the resulting inability of software to process date information later than december  computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
company products the firmware in the company s hardware products does not carry out any date manipulation and thus  by its very nature  is year compliant 
similarly  the company s software products are year compliant because they do not have user interface for the input of date data 
this compliance  however  depends on whether the underlying operating system and other products used with the company s products are year compliant 
the company has solicited the status of year compliance with respect to all of its third party product offerings 
the company s internal systems  state of readiness and costs to remedy the company has conducted an assessment of its computer information systems and has implemented a year plan to modify  upgrade or replace some of its internal financial and operational systems 
the company has estimated the cost of bringing all internal systems  equipment and operations into year compliance to be approximately  currently  the company is approximately complete with the implementation process and has incurred approximately of the total estimated cost 
the company has funded its year plan from operating cash flows 
the company believes  based upon currently available information  that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
third party relationships the company also intends to determine the extent to which it may be vulnerable to any failures by its major suppliers  distributors and service providers  as well as any third parties related to the company s two foreign sales offices  to remedy their own year problems 
the company is in the process of initiating formal communications with these parties 
at this time the company is unable to estimate the nature or extent of any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third party suppliers  distributors and service providers to achieve year compliance  although the company does not currently anticipate that it will experience any material shipment delays from its major product suppliers or any material sales delays from its major distributors due to year problems 
however  there can be no assurance that these third parties will not experience year problems or that any problems would not have a material adverse effect on the company s product supply and distribution channels 
because the cost and timing of year compliance by third parties such as suppliers  distributors and service providers is not within the company s control  no assurance can be given with respect to the cost or timing of such efforts or any potential adverse effects on the company of any failure by these third parties to achieve year compliance 
in addition  the company does not currently have meaningful information concerning the year compliance status of its customers 
as is the case with other companies  if significant numbers of the company s current and future customers fail to achieve year compliance  or if they divert technology expenditures away from those that were reserved for engineering products to address year compliance issues  the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
year risks  contingency plan while the company anticipates that its year risks will be remedied before the year  no assurance can be given that the company s or its material third parties year conversion will be completed by such time 
if these efforts are not completed on time  or if the cost of updating or replacing the company s information systems exceeds the company s current estimates  the year problem could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
management has assessed the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
given its efforts to minimize the risk of year failures  the company believes the worst case scenario would occur if the company were unable to process and fulfill customer orders because of the year problem 
the company has initiated the development of a comprehensive contingency plan in the event that its year conversion is not successfully completed 
the company anticipates the contingency plan to be completed during the third quarter of fiscal potential liability to third parties some commentators have predicted significant litigation regarding year compliance issues and because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether  or to what extent  the company may be affected 
the preceding year compliance disclosure contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and section a of the securities act of these forward looking statements represent the company s beliefs or expectations regarding future events 
when used in the year compliance disclosure  the words believes  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  the company s expectations as to when it will complete the installation and testing of its internal systems  its estimated cost of achieving year readiness  and the company s belief that its internal systems will be year compliant in a timely manner 
all forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the projected results 
factors that may cause these differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of qualified personnel and other information technology resources  the ability to identify and remediate all date sensitive lines of computer code or to replace embedded computer chips in affected systems or equipment  and the actions of third parties with respect to year problems
