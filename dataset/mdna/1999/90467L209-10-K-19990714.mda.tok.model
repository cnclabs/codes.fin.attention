item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on i the level of oil and gas exploration and development activity of oil and gas companies in the gulf of mexico  offshore west africa  south and central america and the middle east  ii the company s ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii the company s ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and gas prices and changes in technology which reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment 
in addition  improvements in three dimensional seismic  directional drilling  production techniques and other advances in technology have increased drilling success rates and reduced costs 
prior to  the average number of active offshore rigs worldwide and in the gulf of mexico had increased annually since december  however  declining commodity prices  reduced drilling budgets and a lack of confidence in the recovery of commodity prices in have caused a reduction in the level of drilling activity and a delay or suspension in projects being planned 
these commodity prices have increased recently  which should increase drilling activity in the future 
during the fiscal years ended march   and   and  respectively  of the company s revenue was derived from projects fabricated for installation in international areas  with the remainder designed for installation in the gulf of mexico 
the company believes that its strong presence in both overseas markets and the gulf of mexico market has enabled it to remain competitive and obtain fabrication work worldwide 
the company expects that an increased activity level in the gulf of mexico will lead to an increasing percentage of the company s revenue coming from projects intended for installation in the gulf of mexico  although no assurance can be given as to continued strong commodity price or any resulting increased drilling activity by the oil and gas companies 
most of the company s revenue and expenses are recognized on a percentage of completion basis determined by the ratio that labor or labor and subcontracting costs incurred bear to the total estimated labor or total estimated labor and subcontracting costs required for completion 
accordingly  expected labor and subcontracting costs are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction of previously reported profits  the company would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized on the basis of direct labor hours worked at fixed hourly rates and the cost of materials or subcontract costs incurred plus mark up 
results of operations comparison of the years ended march  and during the year ended march   the company s revenue was million  a decrease from the million generated in the year ended march  this decrease was primarily caused by the general reduction in demand for the company s structural fabrication services brought on by continued low oil prices and a downturn in natural gas prices 
total direct labor hours worked decreased from the levels experienced in the prior year 
in particular  structural fabrication revenue decreased to million from million 
this decrease was offset in part by international project management revenue of million  and an increase in rig refurbishment and plant maintenance revenue of million over the prior year 
cost of revenue was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in fiscal this relative decrease is mainly due to higher margins on production process system design and fabrication work in fiscal this was offset in part by reduced margins on structural fabrication and rig refurbishment and plant maintenance in fiscal compared to selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company s selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in as compared to in fiscal this increase is mainly due to regulatory  reporting and other costs associated with being a corporation with publicly traded securities for a full year  increased amortization of costs in excess of net assets acquired from the pim and latoka acquisitions  and the additional selling  general and administrative costs associated with the company s operations in lake charles  louisiana and wimbledon  england 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  as the weighted average of invested funds was lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal  mainly from the use of the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering being invested in facilities and equipment in fiscal these funds were available for investment for the last six months of fiscal interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease is the result of capitalized interest of approximately million  offset in part by increased borrowings under the company s line of credit and debt acquired in the acquisition of allen tank and latoka 
other expense in fiscal includes costs of  associated with the pooling of allen tank 
this business combination was accounted for as a pooling of interests  and accordingly  the costs associated with the pooling were expensed as incurred 
comparison of the years ended march  and during the year ended march   the company s revenue was million  a increase from the million generated in the year ended march  this increase was primarily caused by prices realized under fixed price contracts  an increase in direct labor hours worked  an increase in production process equipment design and fabrication revenue  and revenue in the fourth quarter generated from the company s operations in lake charles  louisiana 
these increases were offset in part by a reduction in procurement revenue in fiscal compared to procurement revenue in fiscal cost of revenue was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these costs decreased as a percentage of revenues to in from in fiscal this relative decrease is mainly due to the reduced procurement revenue in compared to  as described above  which carries lower margin and increased production process system design and fabrication activity  which carries higher margin 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company s selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in as compared to in fiscal this increase is mainly due to regulatory  reporting and other costs associated with being publicly held  beginning in september and the additional selling  general and administrative costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal associated with the company s operations in lake charles  louisiana 
interest income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  as the weighted average of invested funds was higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal  mainly from investment of the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal interest expense did not fluctuate over the periods as the company s use of funds remained relatively constant 
liquidity and capital resources historically the company has funded its business activities through funds generated from operations  short term borrowings on its revolving credit facilities for working capital needs and individual financing arrangements for equipment  facilities improvements  insurance premiums  and long term needs 
the company s available funds and million generated from operations and financing activities together funded investing activities of million during the fiscal year ended march  investing activities consisted mainly of capital expenditures of million and million for working capital needs advanced to obi under the terms of a secured credit agreement between the company and obi 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities remained at march  and march  capital expenditures included costs of expansion and improvements to the company s fabrication facility in new iberia  construction of a pipe shop and related administrative facilities at the company s lake charles development  purchases of modern  labor saving equipment and heavy machinery  and funds expended in the acquisition of latoka 
the company s growth has also required capital expenditures for equipment to update telecommunication and data processing capabilities 
the company is developing a deep water fabrication and drilling rig refurbishing facility on property leased from the lake charles harbor and terminal district in lake charles  louisiana 
estimated completion of the facility is the third quarter of the march  fiscal year 
under the terms of the lease  the company is committed to fund capital expenditures totaling million to develop the facility and acquire equipment necessary for operations 
through march  the company has funded million toward this development 
the company expects to fund these capital expenditures through the issuance of debt 
on july   the company amended and restated its unsecured credit facility with a commercial lender the credit facility  which provides for up to million in borrowings for general corporate purposes and for up to million in letters of credit under a revolving credit facility 
at march   the company had million in borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the credit facility also provides for a million term loan facility 
the term loan facility calls for principal payments of  per quarter  beginning september  at march   the company had million outstanding under the term loan facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the prime lending rate established by chase manhattan bank  na at march  or libor plus at march  at the company s option 
the fee for issued letters of credit is per annum on the principal amount of letters of credit issued for performance or payment  or per annum on the principal amount if the letter of credit is a financial letter of credit 
the unused commitment fee is of per annum 
the credit facility matures august on april   the company completed its acquisition of obi and substantially all the assets of southern rentals  llc  an affiliate of obi 
the purchase price was approximately million paid through the issuance of approximately  shares of unifab international  inc common stock 
obi recognized revenue and pretax income of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  obi will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of unifab international  inc the business combination will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
management believes that its available funds  cash generated by operating activities  and funds available under the credit facility and contemplated debt issuance discussed above will be sufficient to fund the obi acquisition  planned capital expenditures  scheduled payments under the term credit facility and its working capital needs for the next months 
in the normal course of business  the company is evaluating its debt structure and is considering alternatives to refinance a portion of its credit facility to extend the payment terms beyond the current expiration 
additionally  any expansion of the company s operations through future acquisitions may require additional equity or debt financing 
year issues year issues result from the past practice in the computer industry of using two digits rather than four when coding the year portion of a date 
this practice can create breakdowns or erroneous results when computers and processors embedded in other equipment perform operations involving dates later than december  l the company makes use of computers in its gathering  manipulating  calculating and reporting of accounting  financial  administrative  and management information 
computers are also utilized in communication within the organization and with customers and vendors as an efficient method of transferring documents and information 
year issues could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
readiness the company has assessed and continues to assess the year compliance of its information technology systems and has purchased and installed software and hardware that it believes will be adequate to upgrade all of these systems to year compliance 
the company has also surveyed its significant non information technology equipment for year issues 
while several of these items of equipment are significant to the company s operations such as automated welding and cutting equipment  none of the automated functions of this equipment are date sensitive 
the company believes the equipment will not require replacement or modification for year compliance 
the company does not have any significant customers  suppliers or vendors whose information technology systems directly interface with the company s information technology systems 
however  it is possible the noncompliance of significant customers or suppliers could adversely affect  to a material extent  the operations of the company 
costs because the company s information technology systems have been regularly upgraded and replaced as part of the company s ongoing efforts to maintain high grade technology and because the company is not heavily dependent on non information technology equipment that is date sensitive  the company s year compliance costs are expected to be relatively low 
to date  the company has spent  for software and hardware  which it considers to be related to the year issue 
additional costs are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition 
however  there can be no guarantee that actual costs incurred will not exceed that anticipated by management 
worst case scenario the securities and exchange commission requires that public companies forecast the most likely worst case year scenario 
in doing so  management is assuming that the procedures and assessment described above will not be effective 
analysis of the most likely worst case year scenario the company may face leads to contemplation of the following possibilities which  though unlikely in some or many cases  must be included in any consideration of worst cases widespread failure of electrical  gas and similar supplies by utilities supplying the company  widespread disruption of communications services of common carriers domestically and internationally  similar disruption to means and modes of transportation of the company and its employees  contractors  suppliers and customers  significant disruption of the company s ability to gain access to  and remain working in  office buildings and fabrication facilities  the failure of a substantial number of the company s critical information computer hardware and software systems  and the failure  domestically and internationally  of systems of outside entities  the cumulative effect of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s critical systems 
among other things  the company could face substantial claims by customers or loss of revenues due to the inability to fulfill contractual obligations or to bill customers accurately and on a timely basis  and increased expenses associated with litigation  stabilization of operations following critical failures  and the development and execution of any contingency plans 
the company could also experience an inability by customers to pay  on a timely basis or at all  obligations owed to the company 
under these circumstances  the adverse effect on the company and the diminution of the company s revenues  would be material  although not quantifiable at this time 
summary the company believes it has taken appropriate measures to assess its internal systems and prepare them for year issues 
however  if those measures prove inadequate  the company s ability to estimate and bid on new jobs and its financial and other daily business procedures may be interrupted or delayed  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s operations 
there is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be converted timely and will not have an adverse effect on the company 
while the company intends to continue to monitor year issues  it does not currently have a contingency plan for dealing with the possibility that its current systems may prove inadequate  nor does the company currently intend to develop such a plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest or currency risks 
interest on approximately million  or of the company s notes payable was variable  based on short term market rates 
a general increase of short term market interest rates would result in additional interest cost of  per year if the company were to maintain the same debt level and structure 
the company has a subsidiary located in the united kingdom for which the functional currency is the british pound 
the company typically does not hedge its foreign currency exposure 
historically  fluctuations in british pound us dollar exchange rates have not had a material effect on the company 
future changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar to the british pound may positively or negatively impact earnings  however  due to the size of its operations in the united kingdom  the company does not anticipate its exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations to be material in fiscal while the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments  it may use them in the future if deemed appropriate
