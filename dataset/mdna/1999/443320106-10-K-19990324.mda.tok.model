furthermore  the company hired only of the more than employees in the apldds organization 
the apldds business was absorbed directly into the operations of hub chicago and hub partnerships and management believes the associated incremental operating costs are significantly less than the historical operating costs experienced by apldds

outlook  risks and uncertainties this outlook  risks and uncertainties section contains statements regarding expectations  hopes  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future which are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve risks and uncertainties described below that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
the company assumes no liability to update any such forward looking statements 
in addition to those mentioned elsewhere in this section  such risks and uncertainties include the impact of competitive pressures in the marketplace  the degree and rate of market growth in the markets served by the company  changes in industry wide capacity  further consolidation of rail carriers  changes in governmental regulation  changes in the cost of services from vendors and fluctuations in interest rates 
year year refers to the issue surrounding the compatibility of computer and other technology based systems with dates beyond december  this section will include an assessment of the company s state of readiness  the costs to address the issues  the risks the issues represent and the company s contingency plan 
state of readiness management has broken down its year program into four phases 
those phases are awareness  assessment  renovation and validation 
the company contracted with an outside consulting firm to perform a readiness review  which was completed in december this review was instrumental in identifying and addressing year issues 
management believes that it is aware of the risk areas facing the company regarding year and has broken those areas into seven categories 
the seven categories are i the company s main operating system that has been created and enhanced in house  ii the company s ancillary operating software applications which were purchased  iii desktop hardware and software applications  iv the company s financial reporting system  v the company s telephone systems  vi embedded technology in the company s office equipment  physical environment and drayage tractors and vii the state of readiness of the company s customers  transportation service providers and other vendors 
the company s main operating system is currently being renovated 
the renovation  which consists of reprogramming the source code  has been completed 
the validation phase will start by april   and management estimates that the validation phase will be completed by september  the company believes all of its ancillary operating software applications have been assessed 
all of the supporting vendors have stated that their products are year compliant 
the validation phase is to begin by april   and should be completed by september  the company s financial reporting system vendor has stated that their application is year compliant 
the company plans to execute the validation phase for the financial reporting system as the company s operating system generates year activity during its validation phase 
the validation phase for the financial reporting system is expected to be completed by september  the company s desktop hardware and software application assessment is ongoing 
the company is in the process of creating an inventory of all desktop hardware and software applications 
once completed  the company anticipates hiring an outside consulting firm to execute the renovation and validation phases 
the renovation phase will consist of updating or replacing the hardware or software application if it is not year compliant 
the renovation phase is expected to begin during the second quarter of  and the validation phase is expected to be completed by september  the company is still assessing its many telephone systems 
the amount of time for renovation and validation has not yet been determined 
the company is aware of the potential issues regarding embedded technology in its office equipment  physical environment and drayage tractors 
while the company has not assessed each piece of office equipment  such as fax machines and copiers  it believes its contingency plan will deal effectively enough with the risks of failure that such assessment is not a high priority 
similarly  the company recognizes the potential issues regarding its physical environment  such as heat  electricity  elevators  security systems  etc  but has not ranked the assessment of each to be a higher priority than the resolution of items i through v above 
the company has assessed its embedded technology in its drayage tractors and received a statement from the engine manufacturers that the tractors embedded technology is year compliant 
the company has identified four categories of key third parties with which the company has a material relationship that should be assessed 
those categories are i significant customers who rely on their computer systems to determine their transportation needs  ii key vendors such as the railroads and significant providers of drayage and over the road services  iii our information network communications provider and iv significant third party freight payment vendors utilized by the company s customers 
the company has received statements from certain major customers and from certain major customers third party freight payment vendors regarding their year readiness 
the company has no plans to obtain such statements from all its customers or all its customers third party freight payment vendors 
the company has received statements from the major railroads and many of the company s drayage and over the road service providers that they are year compliant 
the company believes at this time that its information network communications provider will be year compliant 
costs in  the company expensed approximately  related to year in  through february th  the company has expensed an additional  these costs include not only amounts paid to outside parties but also the payroll costs for those employees spending significant amounts of time on year issues 
the company estimates it will spend approximately to million in total related to year the company expects to continue to fund these costs through cash flow from operations or use of its credit facilities 
risk management believes its most likely worst case scenario is a complete shut down of the company s  the railroads or the company s customers main operating systems 
the company believes any of these risks  as well as other risks or combination of risks addressed herein or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
contingency plan the company has not yet developed a formal written contingency plan 
certain aspects of the year contingency plan  such as dealing with an inoperative system  will be a matter of integrating the company s current contingency plans for dealing with the temporary shut downs that occur from time to time 
other aspects of the contingency plan will be developed as the company works through the phases of readiness 
the creation of the contingency plan will be an ongoing process that should be completed by september  revenue management believes that the performance of the railroads is the most significant factor that could negatively influence the company s revenue growth rate 
first  the service disruption in the intermodal industry that started in the fourth quarter of appears to have been significantly rectified 
should this trend reverse  the company s intermodal growth rate would likely be negatively impacted 
should the split up of conrail  scheduled to begin transition on june   cause a similar service disruption  the company s intermodal growth rate would likely be negatively impacted 
should there be another significant service disruption  there may be some customers who would switch from using the company s intermodal service to other carriers over the road service 
these customers may choose to continue to utilize these carriers even when intermodal service levels are restored 
net revenue management expects fluctuations in the net revenue percentage from quarter to quarter caused by changes in business mix  changes in highway brokerage margins  changes in logistics business margins  changes in trailer and container capacity  changes in vendor pricing  changes in intermodal industry growth  changes in intermodal industry service levels and changes in accounting estimates 
salaries and benefits it is anticipated that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between revenue increases and changes in levels of staffing 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range are revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses  changes in customer requirements or changes in railroad intermodal service levels which could result in a lower or higher cost of labor per move 
selling  general and administrative there are several factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue 
should management decide that customer expectations and the competitive environment require restructuring of its information systems and related platforms  there could be significant expenses incurred  some of which would not be capitalized 
costs incurred to formulate the company s strategy as well as any costs that would be identified as reengineering or training would be expensed 
the company also expects to spend approximately million to million related to year issues in see year depreciation and amortization management estimates that as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization will increase in the future 
factors that will cause an increase in the percentage are increased leasehold improvement amortization as operating companies transition to larger facilities  increased software amortization related to improving the company s information systems capabilities and a full year of goodwill amortization related to the purchase of the minority interest in the texas hubs as well as the acquisition of quality 
factors that could cause an increase in the percentage are additional acquisitions or minority interest purchases as well as increased depreciation expense on any capitalized costs that could be incurred in conjunction with a change in the company s information systems strategy 
other income expense the purchase of additional minority interest or new business acquisitions would likely cause an increase in the company s debt levels and therefore an increase in interest expense 
management estimates that interest income will likely decrease from current levels 
factors that could cause such a decrease are the possible use of cash to i make payments on the balloon notes  ii make payments on the apldds note  iii make payments on the company s line of credit  iv fund the purchase of the remaining minority interest in any of its operating partnerships  v fund working capital needs and vi fund capital expenditures 
minority interest factors that could have a material impact and result in minority interest percentages of income before minority interest to be outside the historical range are i the exercise of any of the company s options to purchase the remaining minority interest in any of its operating companies and ii disproportionate changes in the profitability of businesses between those which are owned by the company and those which are owned less than by the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company has the continuing option  exercisable any time after the local in charge executive currently associated with an operating partnership ceases to be an employee  to purchase the remaining interest in that partnership 
the future exercise of such options could result in the need for significant funds 
those funds may come from existing cash  third party debt  other financing or any combination thereof 
the company believes that cash  cash to be provided by operations  cash available under its lines of credit and the company s ability to obtain additional credit capacity will be sufficient to meet the company s short term working capital and capital expenditure needs 
the company believes that the aforementioned items are sufficient to meet its anticipated long term working capital  capital expenditure and debt repayment needs through at least the year item a
