see note  disposal of operating company of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a portion of these proceeds along with existing cash balances were utilized for general corporate purposes and to pay down debt of approximately million  to purchase and retire common shares of approximately million and for acquisitions of real property held for rental of approximately million 
it is anticipated that the remaining cash balances will be reinvested into the company s businesses during the current liabilities of the company have historically exceeded its current assets principally due to the financing of the purchase of long term assets utilizing short term borrowings and from the classification of current mortgage obligations without the corresponding current asset for such properties 
future financial statements may reflect current liabilities in excess of current assets 
management is confident that through cash flow generated from operations  together with borrowings available under the revolving credit facility discussed below and the sale of select assets  all obligations will be satisfied as they come due 
the company s portfolio of available for sale securities had a fair market value of approximately million at december   reflecting pretax unrealized holding gains of approximately million

under the terms of the credit agreement  the company will be provided with eligibility based upon the sum of i of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date net operating income of eligible properties  as defined  capitalized at and ii the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory  as defined 
eligibility is also limited by amounts outstanding under the term loan 
at december   eligibility under the revolver was million  based upon the above terms 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and restrictive covenants  including minimum consolidated equity  interest coverage  debt service coverage and capital expenditures other than for real estate 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  the credit agreement also contains provisions which allow the lenders to perfect a security interest in certain operating and real estate assets in the event of a default  as defined in the credit agreement 
borrowings under the revolver  at the company s option  bear interest at the bank s prime lending rate or at the london interbank offered rate libor plus while borrowings under the term loan bear interest at day libor plus 
the term loan is payable in quarterly principal installments of  with the final payment due on september  the revolver expires on january  at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolver and million was outstanding on the term loan 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert its floating rate term loan to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future expense 
under the swap agreement  the company agreed to exchange with the counterparty a commercial bank the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest amounts 
the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap is recognized over the term of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
the fair value of the swap agreement is not recognized in the financial statements 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and or remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and has filed an action against certain insurance carriers seeking recovery of costs incurred and to be incurred in these matters 
based upon the advice of counsel  management believes such recovery is probable and therefore should not have a material effect on the liquidity or capital resources of the company 
however  the ultimate outcome of litigation cannot be predicted 
to date settlements have been reached with several carriers in this matter 
at december  and december  a total of million in anticipated insurance recoveries has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is included in other assets 
additionally  in the company received approximately million of insurance proceeds 
the remaining balance of million at december  from a total of million is in dispute with the company s insurance carriers as more fully discussed in item legal proceedings and note  contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that recoveries in excess of the amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are available under the insurance policies but have not been recorded 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will prevail in its efforts to obtain amounts at or in excess of the estimated recoveries 
in october  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of the company s common stock 
purchases will be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices and may be made in privately negotiated transactions  subject to available resources 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated by current operations and additional borrowings 
it is expected that future operational cash needs and the cash required to repurchase the company s common stock will also be satisfied from existing cash balances  ongoing operations and additional borrowings on the revolver 
the primary source of capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and to make additional high yield mortgage loans will come from existing funds  the sale  financing and refinancing of the company s properties and from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection with specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting of cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties in exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company may also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings from institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equity securities 
funds of the company in excess of that needed for working capital  purchasing real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested by the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  other financial instruments  certificates of deposit and government securities 
market risk the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general levels of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
the company s available for sale securities consist of us investments in both common and preferred equity issues and are subject to the fluctuations in us stock markets 
all of the company s mortgages payable are fixed rate and self amortizing from the net cash flow on the underlying properties 
the company s term loan debt is variable rate but is effectively hedged by an interest rate swap agreement  whose notional amount matches the principal balance of the variable rate debt it hedges 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sells its products in those markets as well as the european  south american and asian markets 
substantially all of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and the company s operating results are not materially exposed to changes in exchange rates 
the company s manufacturing operations utilize various metal commodities principally stainless steel in the manufacturing process 
global competition has stabilized or reduced prices in the key metals used in the company s manufacturing processes 
while key metals purchased from foreign entities are generally denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in the suppliers local currencies may have some impact on materials pricing 
the company is unable to quantify the effects of such fluctuations  however  it does enter into purchase commitments for certain key metals that generally do not exceed twelve months and tend to minimize short term currency fluctuations 
the company s financial results  however  could be significantly affected by fluctuations in metals pricing 
the following is a tabular presentation of quantitative market risks at december  principal notional amount by expected maturity fair there value dollars in thousands after total assets available for sale securities  principally equity securities    mortgage notes receivable    average interest rate liabilities long term debt  including current portion fixed rate         average interest rate variable rate       average interest rate libor interest rate derivative financial instruments related to variable rate debt interest rate swaps pay fixed receive variable      average pay rate average receive rate business trends total revenues of the company decreased approximately million or from levels to million 
the reduction in revenues is attributable to revenue reductions in the engineered products segment as real estate operations posted a increase in revenues 
income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in principally due to an increase in operating profit of the company s real estate operations partially offset by reduced operating profit in the engineered products segment resulting from the reduction in revenues and an increase in general corporate expenses 
the results of the company s real estate operations reflect an increase in operating profit of million on a revenue increase of million 
the increase in operating profits is primarily attributable to operating profits associated with properties acquired in and  a nonrecurring adjustment for real estate tax abatements  reduced interest expense from continued amortization of mortgage indebtedness  and lower depreciation expense associated with properties sold in the prior year 
continuing lease renewals and mortgage amortization will continue to have a positive effect upon the revenues and operating profit of this segment 
where appropriate  management may use permanent long term financing rather than its short term revolving credit facility to finance its real estate acquisitions 
in september  the company borrowed million secured by a mortgage on two properties that the company purchased in may these properties are leased for five years with option periods and the mortgage is self amortizing over the primary lease term  bearing interest at 
future acquisitions of real estate may also be financed with self amortizing mortgages 
the company s engineered products segment posted an decrease in revenues during the twelve months ended december   from the comparable period while operating profits decreased approximately 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to continuing price competition and declining worldwide automotive sales 
operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased less than the reduction in revenues principally due to a favorable market for stainless steel purchases  as well as an ongoing emphasis on cost reductions and productivity improvements 
sales in are anticipated to approximate levels  however  management is aggressively pursuing new sales opportunities including new geographical markets for its existing products and new applications for its core technologies 
in addition  the results of this segments transformer operations have continued to reflect significant improvements over the prior year and management is hopeful to continue this trend 
at december   approximately of the company s employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in february while the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good it is currently negotiating a renewal to its labor contract 
there can be no assurance that the labor contract will be renewed or the terms of any such agreement 
failure to renew this contract can result in a strike or other work stoppage that could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
year conversion the company currently believes that its essential processes  systems and business functions will be ready for the millennium transition and is taking the necessary steps to accomplish this objective 
the company has undertaken the implementation in its manufacturing operations of a fully integrated enterprise resource planning erp software package 
although the erp package was implemented for purposes other than remediating the year issue  the erp package is certified as year compliant 
as part of this implementation  which was completed in december  the company also believes that it has identified and addressed all its related year hardware issues 
the company believes that the costs  if any  directly associated with year compliance will not be material to its financial conditions or results of operations 
year issues are not significant to the company s real estate operations 
substantially all third parties banks  suppliers  customers for which the company has a business relationship are among the largest and most sophisticated companies in the country and the company is providing the data necessary for these companies to evaluate their year issues 
the company believes that it has taken reasonable steps in preparing for the year issue  but cannot ensure that all of its year issues or those of its significant third parties will be resolved or addressed satisfactorily before the year commences 
any resulting disruption could have a material adverse impact on its business
