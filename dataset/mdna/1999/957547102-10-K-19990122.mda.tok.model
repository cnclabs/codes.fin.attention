the costs of engine blocks and other components are subject to foreign currency fluctuations primarily the japanese yen 
the value of the us dollar relative to the yen had no material effect on the cost of the company s products in fiscal year compliance the company is aware of the potential for industry wide business disruption which could occur due to problems related to the year issue 
it is the belief of the company s management that it has a prudent plan to address these issues within the company and with its suppliers 
the components of the company s plan include an assessment of internal systems for modification and or replacement  communication with vendors to determine their state of readiness to maintain an uninterrupted supply of goods and services to the company  an evaluation of the company s production equipment as to its ability to function properly after the turn of the century  an evaluation of facility related issues  and the development of a contingency plan 
state of readiness the company has developed a plan to reduce the probability of operational difficulties due to year related failures 
while there is still a significant amount of work to do  the company believes that it is on track towards a timely completion 
internal systems information technology the company is in the process of completing its assessment of all information technology systems that could be significantly affected by the year issue 
the assessment has indicated that certain systems are already year compliant while others are still in the process of being remediated 
the company has received from its software vendor the updated software necessary to make its operating system year compliant  which the company anticipates will be installed by the end of its second quarter 
suppliers the company is in the process of communicating with its external vendors to gain an understanding of their readiness to maintain an uninterrupted supply of goods and services to the company 
the company has identified vendors it views as critical to its business 
the company is defining a critical vendor as one whose inability to continue to provide goods and services would have a serious adverse impact on the company s ability to produce  deliver and collect payment 
to date  the company is not aware of any supplier with a year issue that would materially impact the results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that suppliers will be year ready 
the inability of suppliers to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially impact the company 
production equipment the company has completed an inventory of production equipment currently used at the company 
the company has determined the year readiness of its equipment through communication with the equipment manufacturers and testing where appropriate 
the company is not aware of any production equipment that is effected by the year issue 
facility related issues the company is in the process of evaluating facilities related equipment with the potential for year related failures 
the company will determine the year readiness of its equipment through communication with the equipment manufacturers and testing where appropriate 
it is the company s intention to repair or replace non compliant equipment prior to operating difficulties 
the company  as in most companies  remains aware of the potential for imbedded logic within microchips to cause equipment failure 
the company believes that it has a prudent approach towards evaluating facilities equipment  however  it may be impracticable or impossible to test certain items of equipment for year readiness 
to the extent such untested equipment is not year ready  it may fail to operate on january   resulting in possible interruption of security  heating  telephone and other services 
costs the company is evaluating the total cost of year compliance 
at this time  the company estimates the total cost of year related activities to be approximately  this amount is not incremental spending and has been budgeted within the normal magnitude of information technology spending 
this amount includes the replacement of hardware and applications that are outdated and were due for replacement regardless of year issues 
contingency plan although the company believes that it is taking prudent action related to the identification and resolution of issues related to the year  its assessment is still in progress 
the company may never be able to know with certainty whether certain key vendors are compliant 
failure of key vendors to make their computer systems year compliant could result in delayed deliveries of products to the company 
if such delays are extended they could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company continues to evaluate the risks associated with potential year related failures 
as it better understands the risks within its unique set of business partners  production processes  and internal systems  it will develop a formal contingency plan outlined by april until the contingency plan is completed  the company does not possess the information necessary to estimate the potential impact of year compliance issues relating to its information technology systems  non information technology systems  its vendors  its customers  and other parties
