item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general amplicon generates revenues from its leasing activities  the sale of leased property and from interest income earned on its cash and liquid investments 
direct financing lease revenues include interest income earned on the company s investment in lease receivables and residuals and gains recognized on the sale of leases in which the company retains no significant continuing interest 
revenues from sales type leases consist of the re lease of off lease property lease extensions and new lease transactions that qualify as sales type leases  generally where the fair value of the property subject to the lease differs from the company s carrying cost 
revenues from operating leases generally involves the short term rental of leased property 
the volume of new lease transactions booked during the year ended june  was approximately million  compared to million in fiscal and million during fiscal of the new leases booked during the fiscal year ended june   approximately were structured as true leases where amplicon owns the leased asset at the end of the term  while were structured as conditional sale leases where the lessee generally may purchase the property at a predetermined minimum amount at the end of the term 
for true lease transactions  the company books a residual which is an estimate for accounting purposes of the fair market value of the leased property at lease termination 
the company s estimates are reviewed continuously to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts the company may ultimately realize could differ from such estimated amounts 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors  including the volume of new lease originations  the volume and profitability from re marketing leased property through re lease or sale  variations in the mix of lease originations  the credit quality of our portfolio and economic conditions in general 
the company conducts its leasing business in a manner designed to minimize its credit exposures 
however  the assumption of risk is a key source of earnings in the leasing industry and the company is subject to risks through its investment in lease transactions in process  investment in lease receivables held in its own portfolio and residual investments 
the company establishes reserves to cover such risks and regularly reviews their adequacy considering levels of non performing leases  lessees financial condition  leased property values as well as general economic conditions and credit quality indicators

liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operating activities through nonrecourse debt and internally generated funds 
capital expenditures for leased property purchases are primarily financed by assigning certain base term lease payments to banks or other financial institutions 
the assigned lease payments are discounted at fixed rates such that the lease payments are sufficient to fully amortize the aggregate outstanding debt 
the company does not purchase property until it has received a noncancelable lease from its customer and  generally  has determined that the lease can be discounted on a nonrecourse basis 
at june   the company had outstanding nonrecourse debt aggregating  relating to property under capital leases 
in the past  the company has been able to obtain adequate nonrecourse funding commitments  and the company believes it will be able to do so in the future 
from time to time  the company retains leases in its own portfolio rather than assigning the leases to financial institutions 
during the fiscal year  the company decreased its net investment in leases by  this decrease was primarily due to fewer new lease transactions being held in the company s own lease portfolio 
the company will often make payments to purchase leased property prior to the commencement of the lease and assignment to other financial institutions 
the disbursements for such lease transactions in process are generally made to facilitate the property implementation schedule of the lessees 
the lessee is contractually obligated by the lease to make rental payments directly to the company during the period that the transaction is in process  and the lessee is generally obligated to reimburse the company for all disbursements under certain circumstances 
at june   the company s investment in property acquired for transactions in process decreased by  to  this decrease was primarily due to the lower volume of new lease transactions originated during fiscal the company generally funds its equity investments in leased property and transactions in process with internally generated funds and  if necessary  borrowings under a  general line of credit 
at june   the company did not have any borrowings outstanding on this line of credit 
in november and april  the board of directors authorized management  at its discretion  to repurchase up to  shares each  or a total of  of the company s common stock 
during the year ended june   the company repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of  as of september    shares remain available under these authorizations 
the need for cash used for operating activities will increase as the company expands 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operations  cash flows from its financing and investing activities  available borrowings under its existing credit facility  and assignments on a nonrecourse basis of anticipated lease payments will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable financing needs 
inflation has not had a significant impact upon the operations of the company 
year the year issue yk is a problem that relates to the way that computers store  manipulate  and interpret dates that define the year using only two digits 
these systems may experience problems handling dates beyond and therefore  could cause computer or other systems to fail or provide erroneous results 
date information can exist at any level of hardware or software from micro code to application programs  in files and databases  and might be present on any operating platform 
amplicon  inc 
the company has addressed this issue by implementing a program to assess  remediate and mitigate the potential impact of the yk problem 
the company is in the process of systematically addressing the yk compliance of its computer related hardware  major application software programs  externally supplied software  and major debt sources  vendors and customers 
the company s computer related hardware consists primarily of servers and desktop computers incorporated into a local area network and a telephone switch 
the company has completed its assessment of its internal hardware related to the local area network and the replacement of non compliant hardware has been substantially completed 
the company completed an upgrade of its telephone switch and related software to bring it into compliance during the third quarter of fiscal the company s major application software programs include three operating systems  four database engines  approximately ten vendor supplied software applications and one internally developed software application 
the company has completed its assessment of these major software application programs 
of these applications  all operating systems and database engines are compliant  as are all but one of the software applications 
the company is currently in the process of implementing the replacement for this software application  which should be completed by october  the total costs of the company s yk project are estimated to be approximately  a significant portion of which would have been incurred within normal operating plans for maintaining the company s systems 
these costs have been funded through operating cash flows 
the company has contacted its major debt sources  vendors and customers with regard to their yk compliance and has received responses from most 
all of the company s major debt sources have advised the company that they are or will be yk compliant by december  no vendors or customers have advised the company that they do not expect to be compliant 
however  almost all have cautioned the company that they cannot predict if there might be a negative impact to their operations due to the non compliance of an unrelated third party 
the company is in the process of addressing any material non responsive customers and vendors during the first half of fiscal management believes that the company s internal systems are in substantial compliance with the yk at this time and that the company should not have a material business risk as a result of this issue 
it is difficult  however  to predict the effect of any third party non readiness on our business 
significant yk failures in our systems or in the systems of third parties or third parties upon whom they depend could have an adverse effect on our financial results and operations 
potential problems that might occur could include an increase in credit losses due to yk problems for our lessees and disruption in the business of our debt sources which may result in lease funding delays for the company 
the amount of these potential credit losses or the degree of disruption cannot be determined at this time 
the company is currently finalizing contingency plans in the event that it does experience any such disruption
