tampa electric s operating revenues tampa electric s operating revenues increased almost percent  after the recognition of million of previously deferred revenues 
the company had customer growth of percent and retail energy sales growth of more than percent 
tampa electric s revenues  including recognition of million of previously deferred revenues  increased almost percent  with customer growth increasing more than percent and retail energy sales up percent 
the economy in tampa electric s service area continued to grow in  with increased employment from corporate relocations and e x p ansions 
combined residential and commercial sales volumes increased over percent in  reflecting the addition of almost  customers and increased demand during warmer than normal summer weather 
combined residential and commercial energy sales declined slightly in  as the effects of mild weather more than offset the addition of more than  new customers 
non phosphate industrial sales increased in and  reflecting the shift of some commercial customers to the industrial classification to take advantage of favorable tax law changes on electricity used in manufacturing 
this shift does not affect tampa electric revenues 
sales to the phosphate industry in were slightly below levels  reflecting a gradual migration of phosphate mining activity out of tampa electric s service area 
this decline could accelerate if customers within the phosphate customer group decide to pursue new self generation projects 
revenues from the phosphate customer group represented slightly more than percent of base revenues in based on expected growth reflecting both population and business activity increases  tampa electric projects retail energy sales growth of approximately percent annually over the next five years  with combined energy sales growth in the residential and commercial sectors of almost percent annually 
energy sales to non phosphate industrial customers are expected to grow almost percent annually over the next five years 
all of these growth projections assume continued local area economic growth  normal weather and other factors 
see the investment considerations section 
non fuel revenues from sales to other utilities were million in  million in and million in the non fuel revenue increase in reflected the shift from broker system economy sales to longer term higher margin wholesale power sales 
megawatt hours sold to other utilities decreased in primarily because higher retail energy sales absorbed more generation capacity  and were lower in due to lower tampa electric generating unit availability 
the decrease in non fuel revenue in is the result of lower sales volumes and a shift from longer term sales to shorter term sales  because of an adverse fpsc decision in late  described in the utility regulation wholesale power sales contracts section 
tampa electric will concentrate its prospective wholesale power sales efforts on energy broker or other short term sales  and not on longer term capacity contracts as was the case prior to this ruling 
the fpsc decision  which required tampa electric to change the regulatory treatment of two wholesale power sales contracts  had the effect of reducing tampa electric s earnings by about 
per share 
the company terminated one contract and incurred a charge of 
per share in for actions to mitigate the effect of this treatment on the second contract

 retail customers average tampa electric s operating expenses non fuel operation and maintenance expenses increased almost percent in required expenditures to enhance system reliability and timing of generation station outages contributed to an increase of over million in maintenance expense 
other operation expenses were essentially level with  the result of effective cost management and improved efficiency throughout the company 
based on maintenance activity in  non fuel operations and maintenance expenses in are expected to be lower than  then increase at approximately the rate of inflation over the next several years 
in september  tampa electric completed construction of the megawatt  state of the art  clean coal technology polk unit one 
the fpsc has allowed full recovery of capital costs and operating expenses associated with the plant as described in the utility regulation rate stabilization strategy section 
the addition of this facility was the primary reason for the increased non fuel operating expenses in through  a total of million from the us department of energy doe was received to partially offset a s i gnificant portion of the non fuel operation and maintenance expenses 
for  approximately million in funds are available from the doe 
operating expenses millions change change other operating expenses 

maintenance depreciation taxes  other than income operating expenses fuel purchased power total fuel expense total operating expenses reflecting normal plant additions to serve the growing customer base  depreciation expense increased by million in depreciation expense increased million in due to normal plant additions and a full year of service of polk unit one 
depreciation expense is projected to rise moderately for the next several years due to normal additions to utility plant  as well as the addition of a flue gas desulfurization system in see environmental compliance section 
taxes other than income increased in as a result of higher gross receipts taxes and franchise fees related to higher energy sales 
these taxes are recovered through customer bills 
in  changes in taxes other than income reflected the property taxes associated with polk unit one 
total fuel expense and purchased power increased in and due to higher energy sales 
average coal costs  on a cents per million btu basis  increased percent in after a percent decrease in the overall success in controlling system fuel expense is a result of tampa electric s use of lower priced coals  the mix in operating generating units and favorable prices in spot coal markets 
in  the fpsc disallowed  retroactively to  certain quality adjustments for coal purchased from a tampa electric affiliate  resulting in a one time pretax nonoperating charge of million 
purchased power increased in due to weather related demand and the provision of replacement power for certain wholesale power sales contracts 
in  purchased power increased primarily due to lower generating unit availability 
in each year  substantially all fuel and purchased power expenses were recovered through the fuel adjustment clause 
nearly all of tampa electric s generation in the last three years has been from coal  and the fuel mix is expected to continue to be substantially coal 
external forecasts indicate relatively stable coal prices for the next few years compared to oil or gas prices 
on a total energy supply basis  self generation accounted for percent of the total system energy requirement in peoples gas system peoples gas system results peoples gas system pgs achieved operating income growth in excess of percent over  with the increase due primarily to new customer additions and higher average utilization per customer 
the benefits of customer growth for the year were partially offset by the effects of warmer than normal weather during the winter months and by restructuring costs associated with the decision to exit the appliance sales and service business 
operating income grew percent in over  reflecting increased customers  effective cost control and the acquisition of west florida natural gas company wfng 
these factors were somewhat offset by the mild weather early in the actual cost of gas and upstream transportation purchased and resold to end use customers is recovered through a purchased gas adjustment clause approved by the fpsc

wfng was acquired in in a merger transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
prior year financial results were not restated for the effects of this merger due to its size 
residential gas sales increased in  primarily as a result of overall customer growth and the addition of high end customers throughout the year 
results reflected slightly warmer weather in compared to residential gas sales increased in due to the addition of wfng  partially offset by a mild winter which followed a much colder than normal winter in operating revenues from residential and commercial customers grew almost percent in  while revenues from industrial and power generation customers were approximately percent below last year 
the increase in residential revenues was primarily due to higher average utilization per customer  reflecting the addition of high end  multiple appliance customers 
o p e rating expenses increased during  reflecting restructuring costs totaling million 
these costs were primarily for early retirement and severance costs affecting employees  associated with a decision in april to exit the appliance sales and service business 
the restructuring  which was initiated in july  was completed and began to yield savings in ongoing expenses by the end of pgs is the largest investor owned gas distribution utility in florida  with about percent of the market 
it serves almost  customers in all of the major metropolitan areas of florida 
pgs expects to invest an average of million per year for the next five years to grow the business  roughly doubling the historical level of capital expenditures 
infrastructure is being expanded both in areas currently served and into areas not yet served by natural gas 
in april  pgs announced plans to expand into the southwest florida market providing service to fort myers  naples  cape coral and surrounding areas 
it is anticipated that  new homes and businesses will be added in this market over the next decade  representing a significant opportunity for growth in the high end residential and the commercial customer sectors 
the company also is expanding to the us naval station at mayport near jacksonville and anticipates that the mayport facilities and surrounding communities will use over million therms of natural gas annually 
pgs expects savings from the discontinuance of its appliance sales and service business and will continue making cost control improvements 
pgs began partnering with companies in an established dealer network to provide sales  installation and repair services to customers 
pgs expects increases in sales volumes and corresponding revenues in and  beginning in late  customer additions and related revenues will begin to reflect the southwest florida expansion 
all of these growth projections assume continued local area economic growth  normal weather and other factors 
see the investment considerations section 
teco transport teco transport recorded slightly higher operating income in  primarily from utilizing added equipment on the river system  a full year s operation of the ocean vessel acquired in late  increased northbound shipments on the river  lower fuel costs and continued initiatives to control operating expenses 
depreciation expense decreased  reflecting longer estimated economic lives of certain assets 
improvements were partially offset by a number of factors  including unprecedented extreme weather in the early part of the year and hurricanes later in the year  which created delays and difficult operating conditions in each of the transportation businesses 
the asian economic situation and the strong u 
s 
dollar also affected teco transport  resulting in lower prices and export volumes 
in  teco transport achieved higher operating income due to increased tampa electric volumes at the transfer terminal to replenish coal inventories depleted in and increased operating efficiencies in each of the operating companies 
the ocean going business also benefited from a full year of operations from a vessel added in and increased grain charter business 
the river business was impacted by adverse weather conditions early in this was partially offset by increased northbound business and higher volumes handled for tampa electric 
in  teco transport expanded its river fleet by about percent  adding barges and three towboats 
i n  teco transport expects increased transfers and additional northbound river shipments of steel and steel related products as a result of steel mini mills built along the river system 
also in  revenue improvement is expected from the continued strong domestic demand for coal and phosphate products 
in addition  the company will continue to diversify into new markets and cargoes 
significant factors that will influence results are weather  commodity grain prices and domestic and international economic conditions 
see the investment considerations section 
teco coal teco coal s operating income  excluding the one time adjustment to asset values discussed below  increased percent in due to continued growth in sales to the metallurgical and steam markets  lower unit costs at its gatliff and clintwood elkhorn facilities and improved preparation plant performance at its clintwood elkhorn facility 
in  operating income increased percent due to increased shipments of specialty coals to third parties from the new facilities at clintwood elkhorn 
the growth in third party steam coal sales and a slight improvement in prices for coal from the premier mines more than offset higher production costs at premier and lower shipments to tampa electric 
coal sales increased to million tons in  compared with million tons in and million tons in volumes in are expected to approach million tons 
tampa electric shipments represented slightly more than percent of total volumes in and percent in shipments to tampa electric of  tons declined by about  tons  or about percent  in after a similar decline in tampa electric s volume in is expected to be  tons 
success in burning more conventional and lower cost steam coals has enabled tampa electric to adopt a competitive strategy of phasing down coal shipments from teco coal for the last several years 
the contract with tampa electric expires at the end of and will not be renewed 
in  teco coal recorded a one time pretax charge of million to adjust the value of certain mining facilities 
the majority of this charge reflects a revaluation of assets at teco coal s gatliff mine dedicated to the tampa electric contract 
because of the anticipated loss in value of this facility at the end of the tampa electric contract  an adjustment was required to reduce the carrying value of the assets 
the million charge also reflected adjustments for other assets which have decreased in market value  reflecting limited markets that exist for the coal from these facilities due to the specific characteristics of the product and high mining costs 
in september  teco coal acquired million tons of metallurgical grade coal reserves contiguous to its existing clintwood elkhorn operation and constructed a new preparation plant at this location 
this facility  which supports an additional one million tons of annual production  went in service in mid metallurgical coal has unique characteristics and is sold primarily to the steel industry both domestically and internationally 
sales to this market increased in and are expected to increase in see the investment considerations section 
teco power services teco power services tps recorded slightly lower operating income in and  primarily as a result of a significant increase in business development activity in and increased interest expense associated with the million limited recourse project financing in for the alborada power station in guatemala 
although operating income was below  net income was slightly above last year  reflecting lower taxes in guatemala 
tps accomplished a number of long term initiatives during  including participation in a consortium which purchased percent of eegsa  guatemala s largest electric distribution company and also the largest in central america 
tps owns a percent interest in this consortium and contributed million in equity 
the total purchase price paid by the consortium was million 
tps also entered into a joint venture arrangement with mosbacher power group partners in through this affiliation  it is currently participating in one generation project and is working on the development of others 
tps provides capital  technical experience  support for development costs and other business strengths 
in return  tps gains an expanded domestic and international presence with opportunities for project returns  including preferred returns before benefits are shared 
in february  tps formed a joint venture relationship with energia global international  ltd 
egi  a bermuda based energy development firm 
the transaction provides tps with an immediate stake in four power projects in operation or under construction in costa rica and guatemala  and electric distribution companies in el salvador and panama 
tps has initially committed million in the form of a loan  and may provide an additional million for new projects or acquisitions 
the transaction provides a mechanism for tps to acquire direct ownership in egi without additional funding 
tps has a percent interest in a partnership to build  own and operate a megawatt pulverized coal fired power plant  the san jose power station in guatemala 
the other partners are the coastal corporation and the same local partner it has for the alborada power station 
the partnership has a year power supply agreement with eegsa  the same guatemalan distribution utility in which tps purchased an equity interest in the million san jose power station is under construction and was percent complete as of the end of the partnership closed on financing for the project in september  and commercial operation is expected in early tps expects to double its earnings contribution from identified domestic and international generation projects over the next two to three years 
teco power services domestic project  the hardee power station in west central florida  continues to operate reliably  supplying power to seminole electric cooperative and tampa electric 
the alborada power station in guatemala also continues to operate reliably  achieving its highest annual capacity factor in see the investment considerations section 
other diversified companies teco coalbed methane s operating income declined percent in  because of declines in production and lower gas prices that were only partially offset by reduced operating costs and an effective hedging program 
production declined to billion cubic feet bcf in  from bcf in effective gas prices averaged 
per thousand cubic feet mcf below  including the favorable results of hedging  which resulted in an additional 
per mcf 
proven reserves were estimated at bcf as of year end  compared to bcf in in  operating income increased more than percent as lower per unit operating costs more than offset a production decline to bcf from bcf in production is expected to decline approximately percent in production from teco coalbed methane s reserves are eligible for non conventional fuels tax credits under section of the internal revenue code through the year the credit  which grows with inflation  was per mcf in  compared to per mcf in the credit is estimated to be per mcf in all gas produced is sold under contract at spot market prices for the life of the reserves 
although natural gas prices can be volatile  the section tax credits provide stability to teco coalbed methane s operating results

peoples gas company pgc  the unregulated propane gas business acquired in the peoples gas companies merger  is the largest independent propane distributor in florida 
in january  teco energy acquired griffis gas  inc in a stock for stock merger transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
about  shares of teco energy common stock were issued in the transaction 
this acquisition facilitated growth of the company s existing market in the jacksonville area and expansion into new markets in gainesville and ocala 
prior year financial results were not restated for the effects of this merger due to its size 
p g c s operating income increased significantly in  reflecting higher volumes resulting from the acquisition of griffis gas and two other propane businesses  which increased its customer base by percent 
operating results were also favorably impacted by improved margins throughout the year 
reflecting the impact of the acquisitions  operating expenses were higher in  which partially offset the volume growth and improved margins 
the company ended with approximately  customers and sales of million gallons of propane  compared with  customers and million gallons in pgc expects to continue its growth initiatives throughout  through acquisitions and expansion of existing markets 
see the investment considerations section 
teco gas services formerly gator gas marketing is another unregulated business acquired in the peoples gas companies merger 
the company provides gas management and marketing services for large municipal  industrial and power generation customers 
in  the company focused on increasing its customer base while continuing to p r o vide gas management services for three large cogeneration facilities 
tecom is marketing advanced energy management  automation and control systems for residential and commercial applications  named the interlane home manager and the interlane power manager  respectively 
t e com continued to capitalize development costs in  reflecting continued product development and enhancement activity 
total costs capitalized in were million  compared with million in in accordance with accepted accounting practices  the company began amortizing capitalized costs in in conjunction with commercial product availability 
a total of 
million was amortized in in addition  a one time after tax charge of million was recorded in  reflecting the write off of product development costs associated with interlane residential system features developed early in the product life and no longer incorporated in the current system s design 
total capitalized costs as of dec 
 were million 
the completion of a significant product development phase has enabled the company to reduce expenditures by almost one half as it continues strategic  marketing and distribution activities 
bosek  gibson and associates  inc bga  an energy services company headquartered in tampa with nine offices throughout florida and two in california  was acquired by teco energy in november it provides design  engineering and construction services to more than customers  including public schools  universities  health care facilities and other governmental facilities throughout florida and california 
d u r ing the year  bga expanded its offerings to include performance contracting for a number of county school districts  as well as the florida state department of corrections  and it completed a district cooling project in tampa 
in addition  bga continued work begun in for the jacksonville naval air station and the suncoast district of the united states postal service 
discontinued operations in august  teco energy announced its intent to exit the conventional oil and gas exploration and production business because of its small scale of operations and earnings volatility 
f o r  teco energy reported an after tax loss from discontinued operations of million which included the net operating results for the year and also included the write off of three offshore wells that ceased production 
in january  teco energy announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell the offshore assets of teco oil gas to american resources offshore  inc aro 
in march  teco oil gas closed this sale for million  consisting of million in cash and a subordinated note in the principal amount of million 
based on the likely impact of certain economic factors  including low oil and gas prices and unfavorable business and operational developments at aro  teco energy has written off the recorded value of all assets associated with the discontinued oil and gas operation  including the million note and associated interest income accrued and remaining on shore assets 
the after tax gain net of charges from discontinued operations in was million  or approximately cents per share 
in march  the company completed a transaction in which it sold the note from aro in return for  in cash 
the company also sold an option relating to its aro warrants  in the event such option is exercised  the company will receive the exercise price of  in a separate transaction  aro agreed to be responsible for disputed joint billing payments of approximately  as part of this settlement  aro also conveyed to the company an overriding royalty interest in two offshore gulf of mexico blocks 
the company does not expect any future royalty payments to be significant 
year computer systems readiness background there is a global awareness that many computer programs use only two digits to refer to a year and  therefore  may not correctly recognize and process date information beyond the year this is referred to as the year issue 
the year issue exists in two primary areas of teco energy s operations the critical business systems such as the financial reporting  procurement  payroll and customer information and billing systems and the control systems such as those used in the operation of electric generation  transmission and distribution facilities and coal mining facilities 
teco energy began work on year readiness in august the project is segmented into the following phases awareness  inventory  assessment  renovation  testing and contingency planning 
the project addresses readiness at tampa electric  peoples gas system and the diversified companies 
readiness teco energy has completed its assessment of all hardware  software and embedded systems and is currently engaged in renovation  testing and contingency planning 
set forth below is a description of readiness by functional area 
critical business systems the critical business systems  including mainframe hardware which was replaced in july  have been substantially renovated and functionally tested 
mainframe integrated system testing has begun and is scheduled to be completed in the first half of ninety five percent of the renovations to the critical business systems have been made  which represents percent of the work required to achieve year readiness for this part of the project 
to assist in assuring readiness  the renovation work and the integration testing are being handled by separate outside firms 
control systems tampa electric management believes that its transmission and distribution systems  including energy management and control and related embedded systems  are now ready for the year  ie renovated and tested to the extent necessary 
tampa electric retained industry specialty firms to assist with identifying areas where renovations were needed in the embedded systems associated with generator unit controls and with making these renovations 
ninety percent of these renovations have been made  which represents an estimated percent of the work required to achieve year readiness for this part of the project 
a number of successful unit tests have been conducted for tampa electric s generating units  and all required plant control system renovations are scheduled to be complete and tested by may critical systems those required for uninterrupted operations in the other parts of teco energy have been renovated  with the exception of a portion of the peoples gas system and the hardee power station control systems and a portion of the teco coal plant control systems  which are scheduled to be fully renovated and tested in the first half of sixty percent of these renovations have been made  which represents an estimated percent of the work required to achieve year readiness for this part of the project 
coordination with others teco energy has surveyed its largest suppliers approximately  with respect to their year readiness  including all providers of technology supplies and services  and plans to complete its customer survey process in the first half of as part of its year project  the company will be coordinating with its suppliers and customers based on their responses to these surveys 
a t the request of the doe  the north american electric reliability council nerc prepared a year coordination plan and preliminary status report in september and updated it in january a full status report is expected by july nerc is conducting monthly readiness assessment surveys and coordinating information sharing and contingency planning activities among the member firms 
the nerc activity addresses all aspects of the interconnected electric grid 
the aggregated results are being reported to the doe and other regulatory bodies in the us  canada and mexico 
the natural gas council  through the american gas a s sociation  is coordinating similar processes within the gas industry  reporting to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
tampa electric and peoples gas system are active participants in these industry groups 
costs the total cost of year remediation is expected to be to million  which includes contracted resources  purchases and internal labor 
an estimated breakdown of project costs is as follows tampa electric million  peoples gas system million  and the diversified companies 
million 
approximately percent of the projected costs are attributable to testing expenses  and the remainder consists primarily of renovation or replacement costs 
through dec 
  approximately million had been spent  including approximately million spent prior to the company expects to spend approximately million in for year remediation 
risks teco energy believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be the occurrence of isolated outages of limited duration for utility customers  similar to those occurring during the utilities storm season 
the utilities have assessed the risk of this scenario  and believe that their contingency efforts  primarily the ability to bypass automated controls  would mitigate the effect of such a scenario 
contingency plans teco energy s contingency plan is scheduled to be completed by the middle of the contingency plan will include a team to be e s t ablished in to monitor all critical systems through significant date transitions and to promptly respond to any problems 
forward looking statements the costs of teco energy s year efforts and the dates on which the company believes it will complete such efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous a s s u mptions regarding future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party remediation plans and other factors 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those currently projected 
specific factors that could cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to identify  assess  remediate and test all relevant computer codes and embedded technology and similar uncertainties 
non operating items other income expense other income expense includes a one time pretax charge of million at tampa electric reflecting the fpsc decision denying recovery of certain coal expenses 
see utility regulation cost recovery clauses section 
the dividend requirement for tampa electric preferred stock  included in other income expense  declined in reflecting the redemption of all outstanding preferred stock 
allowance for other funds used during construction afudc was 
million in and million in  no afudc was recorded in afudc is expected to be approximately million per year over the next five years 
interest charges interest charges were million  down slightly from million in lower interest on a declining deferred revenue balance at tampa electric and lower short term rates were partially offset by higher borrowing levels for new teco power services initiatives and for interest on a capital lease of river barges in interest charges were up percent in  reflecting lower afudc on borrowed funds at tampa electric 
income taxes income tax expense decreased in as pretax income was reduced by million of non recurring charges 
in  income taxes were higher than in  reflecting higher pretax income and the effect of lower afudc on equity funds at tampa electric 
income tax expense as a percent of income from continuing operations before taxes was percent in  percent in and percent in total income tax expense was reduced by the federal tax credit related to the production of coalbed methane 
this tax credit totaled million in  million in  and million in the tax credit was per mcf in  up from in this rate escalates with inflation and could be limited by domestic oil prices 
in  domestic oil prices would have had to exceed per barrel for this limitation to have been effective 
the federal tax credit on production of coalbed methane is available through the year the income tax effect of gains and losses from discontinued operations is shown as a component of results from discontinued operations 
accounting standards accounting for derivative instruments and hedging i n  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the new standard requires an entity to recognize d e rivatives as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements  to measure those instruments at fair value and to reflect the changes in fair value of those instruments as either components of comprehensive income or in net income  depending on the types of those instruments 
teco energy does not use derivatives or other financial products for speculative purposes 
the company has not yet determined to what extent the standard will impact its financial statements 
reporting comprehensive income in  the financial accounting standards board issued fas  reporting comprehensive income  effective for fiscal years beginning after dec 
 the new standard requires that comprehensive income  which includes net income as well as certain changes in assets and liabilities recorded in common equity  be reported in the f i n ancial statements 
for  there were no components of comprehensive income other than net income 
capital expenditures teco energy s capital expenditures of million included million for tampa electric  million for peoples gas system and million for the diversified companies 
tampa electric invested million in for equipment and facilities to meet its growing customer base and generating equipment improvements  million to begin construction of a flue gas desulfurization fgd system  or scrubber for big bend units one and two  and million toward construction of polk unit two  a gas and no 
oil fired combustion t u rbine 
capital expenditures for peoples gas system included approximately million for system expansion  including approximately million related to its southwest florida expansion  and approximately million for maintenance of the existing system 
teco transport invested million in for equipment additions and normal equipment replacement 
teco coal spent million for mining equipment replacements 
teco energy estimates total capital expenditures for ongoing operations to be million for and billion during the period 
for  tampa electric expects to spend million  consisting of million for a scrubber at big bend power station  million in construction costs on polk unit two and million for other capital expenditures 
at the end of  tampa electric had outstanding commitments of about million to complete the scrubber and million to complete polk unit two 
tampa electric s total capital expenditures over the period are projected to be million  including million for generation expansion and million to complete the scrubber 
capital requirements for peoples gas system are expected to be about million in and million during the period for infrastructure expansion to grow the customer base 
included in these amounts are million in for the southwest florida expansion  and expenditures of approximately million annually for other revenue producing projects associated with normal system growth and expansion 
the remainder represents expenditures for ongoing system maintenance 
at the end of  million of these amounts had been committed 
the diversified companies expect capital expenditures of about million in and million during the period 
included in these amounts are million at teco power services for construction of the san jose power station and identified investments in additional projects 
these estimates do not take into account any other future projects which are expected to emerge 
also included in t h e se amounts are the acquisition of coal mining equipment  acquisition of ocean transportation equipment and river barges and normal asset replacement 
at the end of  million of these amounts had been committed 
environmental compliance tampa electric is complying with the phase i emission limitations imposed by the clean air act amendments caaa which became effective jan 
 by using blends of lower sulfur coal  integrating the big bend unit four fgd system with unit three  controlling stack emissions and using emission allowances 
in  tampa electric made a decision to add a scrubber in order to comply with phase ii of the caaa 
the million scrubber will reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted by the tampa electric s big bend units one and two and will allow significant fuel savings at other tampa electric units 
as a result of this project  all of the units at big bend station  tampa electric s largest generating station  will be equipped with scrubber technology 
the fpsc approved the fgd system as the most cost effective a l t e rnative for tampa electric to meet its caaa compliance requirements and the recovery of prudently incurred costs through the environmental cost recovery clause 
cost recovery will not begin  however  until the fgd system is in service and tampa electric has applied for such recovery specifying the costs actually incurred 
the us environmental protection agency epa has commenced an investigation under the clean air act of coal fired electric power generators to determine compliance with environmental permitting requirements associated with repairs  maintenance  modifications and operations changes made to the facilities over the years 
the epa s focus is on whether new source performance standards should be applied to the changes and  accordingly  whether the best available control technology was or should have been used 
tampa electric is one of several electric utilities that have been visited by epa personnel and received a comprehensive request for information pursuant to section of epa s clean air act regulations 
tampa electric is furnishing appropriate information 
it believes that it has built  maintained and operated its facilities in compliance with relevant environmental permitting requirements 
the timing of completion and the outcome of the epa s investigation are uncertain 
tampa electric company is a potentially responsible party for certain superfund sites and  through its peoples gas system division  for certain former manufactured gas plant sites 
while the joint and several liability associated with these sites presents the potential for significant response costs  tampa electric company estimates its ultimate financial liability at approximately million over the next years 
the environmental remediation costs associated with these sites are not expected to have a material impact on customer prices 
utility regulation rate stabilization strategy tampa electric s objectives of stabilizing prices through and securing fair earnings opportunities during this period are being accomplished through agreements entered into with the florida office of public counsel opc and the florida industrial power users group fipug which were approved by the fpsc 
prior to these agreements  the fpsc approved a plan submitted by tampa electric to defer certain revenues 
under this plan tampa electric s allowed return on equity increased to an percent midpoint with a range of percent to percent 
for an initial million of revenues were deferred as well as percent of actual revenues in excess of a roe of percent up to a net earned roe of percent 
also as part of this plan  tampa electric s oil backout tariff was eliminated as of january  reducing annual revenues by approximately million 
in  tampa electric deferred million of revenues under this plan 
the deferred revenues accrued interest at the day commercial paper rate as specified in the florida administrative code 
in  the fpsc approved agreements between tampa electric  the opc and the fipug which froze base rates for the electric utility through  returned million to customers between october and december through refunds and a temporary base rate reduction and allowed full recovery for the capital costs incurred in the polk unit one project 
in addition  the agreements set forth multi year plans for allocating revenues based on tampa electric s roe 
for the years through  tampa electric retained all revenues contributing to a roe of percent 
under this plan  any additional revenues were allocated as follows in  percent of any actual revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent were included in revenues 
the remaining percent were deferred for use in and the company deferred million in this amount and the deferred revenues and interest from less million of refunds provided million for use by the company in and in  percent of any revenues that contributed to a roe in excess of percent up to percent were included in revenues 
the remaining percent were deferred for use in as were all revenues in excess of percent 
the company recognized million in of the revenues and interest deferred from and in  percent of any revenues that contributed to a roe in excess of percent up to percent were included in revenues 
the remaining percent  along with all revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent  including deferrals from prior years  will be refunded to customers in in  tampa electric recognized all of the remaining deferred revenues and interest from and  and based on earnings levels  expects to refund million to customers in  following audits for the years and and final review by the fpsc 
for  percent of the revenues contributing to a roe in excess of percent will be refunded to customers in following audit and review by the fpsc along with any revenues that contribute to a roe above percent 
in  tampa electric recorded million in after tax charges relating to its earnings as a result of an fpsc audit of t h a t year which involved several adjustments  including the establishment for regulatory purposes of an equity ratio cap of percent for compared to the actual ratio for the year of percent 
because of the return on equity thresholds in tampa electric s regulatory agreements described above and the potential for customer refunds in and  tampa electric expects continuing audit scrutiny by the fpsc and active involvement of intervenors in the proceedings for determining the appropriate level of earnings for the remaining years of the stipulation and the resulting level of deferrals and or refunds 
the regulatory arrangements described above covered periods that end on dec 
 in the absence of any new arrangement  tampa electric s rates and the midpoint of its allowed rate of return on common equity percent will continue in effect until such time as changes are occasioned by an agreement approved by the fpsc or other fpsc action as a result of rate or other proceedings initiated by tampa electric  fpsc staff or other interested parties 
tampa electric cannot predict whether there will be any such agreement or the potential outcome related to any other proceedings 
the effective implementation of the rate stabilization strategy has resulted in residential retail rates for that are below per  kwh  even as polk unit one was brought on line 
this rate is almost percent lower than rates just prior to the rate stabilization plan and comparable to rates in wholesale power sales contracts in  the fpsc ruled that costs associated with two long term  wholesale power sales contracts should be assigned to the wholesale jurisdiction for through it further required that  for retail rate making purposes through the end of the stipulation period  the costs separated from retail to wholesale should reflect average costs rather than the lower incremental costs on which the two contracts were based 
by  one of these contracts had been terminated 
in order to mitigate the impacts of the fpsc s ruling on the remaining contract  which expires in  tampa electric entered into firm purchased power contracts with third parties in early to provide replacement power through as a result  tampa electric is no longer separating the associated generation assets from the retail jurisdiction 
because the costs under the firm purchased power c o ntracts exceeded the revenues associated with the remaining wholesale power sale agreement  tampa electric recorded a million pretax charge in the first quarter of tampa electric is considering applying to the fpsc for a ruling that would provide for more favorable regulatory accounting treatment after  as well as other mitigation measures 
cost recovery clauses in  the fpsc changed its proceedings for the recovery of fuel  purchase power and environmental costs from semi annual to annual 
in the november proceeding for calendar year  the fpsc disallowed retroactively to certain quality adjustments for coal purchased from a tampa electric affiliate in excess of an established benchmark 
this resulted in a one time pretax charge of million in in this same proceeding  the fpsc allowed the recovery of million in for environmental costs  a portion of which constitutes a return on investment 
these recoveries  subject to annual approval  are expected to continue in future years in declining amounts as assets depreciate 
long range power supply planning tampa electric filed a ten year site plan with the fpsc in april an amended plan was filed in august as the result of greater than expected growth in retail load 
strong demand in  followed by record energy sales throughout the summer of  were evidence of this growth 
this trend resulted in a projection of reserves falling below the planning criteria of a percent reserve margin prior to the originally scheduled in service date of the next proposed generation addition in the revised plan includes a combustion turbine with a winter rating of mw in january plans for the addition of an already scheduled combustion turbine for remain unchanged 
these additions are not subject to the fpsc s competitive bidding requirements for capacity requirements  but they are subject to its standard offer 
a standard offer is a requirement of the fpsc that is made to qualifying facilities and municipal solid waste facilities for purchased power in order to offset the construction of a new unit 
construction of a new unit may be disallowed entirely if enough power is contracted 
the quantity of power placed in the standard offer as well as the terms and conditions of the contract are specified by the utility and require the approval of the fpsc 
utility competition electric tampa electric s retail electric business is substantially free from direct competition with other electric utilities  municipalities and public agencies 
at the present time  the principal form of competition at the retail level consists of self generation available to larger users of electric energy 
such users may seek to expand their options through various initiatives  including legislative and or regulatory changes that would permit competition at the retail level 
one such initiative  which has apparently been terminated  involved the proposed merchant power plant described below with a claimed self generation use 
this is further discussed in the wholesale power market section which follows 
tampa electric intends to take all appropriate actions to retain and expand its retail business  including managing costs and providing high quality service to retail customers 
in  the fpsc approved a tariff for tampa electric that should assist in reducing the loss of existing at risk load and assist in the acquisition of new load 
this commercial industrial service rider is a load retention or economic development contract  that provides for flexible pricing to meet competitive alternatives available to existing or potential new customers 
wholesale power market there is presently active competition in the wholesale power markets in florida  increasing largely as a result of the energy policy act of and related federal initiatives 
this act removed for independent power producers certain regulatory barriers and required utilities to transmit power from such producers  utilities and others to wholesale customers 
a significant question to be addressed in florida is whether merchant power plants should be permitted to serve growing customer demand for electricity 
merchant plants are built on speculation without a portion or all of their capacity committed under firm purchase agreements 
tampa electric believes that only florida utilities or entities with contracts for firm capacity to serve the long term needs of a florida utility can legally be applicants under the florida power plant siting act ppsa 
the ppsa governs the building of new generation involving steam capacity of megawatts or more and requires the applicant to demonstrate that a plant is needed prior to receiving construction and operating permits 
in  imc agrico imca  a retail customer of tampa electric and other utilities  and duke energy announced that they had signed a letter of intent for the construction of a natural gas fired  combined cycle power plant with a minimum capacity of megawatts to serve load currently served by tampa electric and two other utilities  and the merchant wholesale function described above 
tampa electric and others objected to the proposed project on the grounds that it involved retail transactions within defined service areas that are prohibited under existing florida regulation 
in early and prior to an fpsc ordered evidentiary hearing to determine if the proposed project should be considered permitted self generation or a prohibited retail sale  imca withdrew its petition 
duke energy subsequently announced that it did not intend to pursue the project with imca 
in late  new smyrna beach and duke energy new smyrna beach power company ltd 
applied for fpsc determination of need for a proposed megawatt merchant power plant in volusia county  florida  to supply megawatts of capacity and associated energy to the utilities commission of the city of new smyrna beach with the remaining capacity designated for wholesale sales to other utilities 
tampa electric and others intervened to oppose this proposal 
on march   the fpsc determined that the proponents of the merchant plant are proper applicants under the ppsa and voted to approve the need for the proposed merchant plant 
these decisions are expected to be appealed 
the proposed plant is still subject to environmental and other regulatory approvals 
if the fpsc decision is upheld or other regulatory or legislative actions are taken that allow the construction of wholesale merchant power plants  the wholesale operations of tampa electric and other florida utilities could be adversely affected 
utility competition gas although peoples gas system is not in direct competition with any other regulated distributors of natural gas for customers within its service areas  there are other forms of competition 
at the present time  the principal form of competition for residential and small commercial customers is from companies providing other sources of energy and energy services 
competition is most prevalent in the large commercial and industrial markets 
in recent years  these classes of customers have been targeted by companies seeking to sell gas directly  either using peoples gas system facilities or transporting gas through other facilities  thereby bypassing peoples gas system facilities 
in response to this competition  various programs have been developed including the provision of transportation services at discounted rates 
in general  peoples gas system faces competition from other energy source suppliers offering fuel oil  electricity and in some cases propane 
peoples gas system has taken actions to retain and expand its commodity and transportation business  including managing costs and providing high quality service to customers 
investment activity at dec

in and  the drp purchased teco energy shares on the open market for plan participants 
as a part of its risk management program  during teco finance entered into an interest rate exchange agreement to moderate its exposure to short term interest rate changes 
this three year agreement effectively converted the interest rate on million of short term debt from a floating rate to a fixed rate 
teco finance paid a fixed rate of and received a floating rate based on a day commercial paper index 
this agreement  which expired in june  did not have a significant impact on interest expense in  or teco energy is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities 
a hypothetical percent increase in teco energy s weighted average interest rate on its variable rate debt would not have a significant impact on teco energy s pretax earnings over the next fiscal year

teco power services expects to finance the san jose power station with limited recourse project financing upon commercial operation 
investment considerations the following are certain factors that could affect teco energy s f u ture results 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report and otherwise made by or on the behalf of teco energy  since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
g e neral economic conditions 
the company s businesses are dependent on general economic conditions 
in particular  the projected growth in tampa electric s service area and in florida is important to the realization of tampa electric s and the peoples gas companies forecasts for annual energy sales growth 
an unanticipated downturn in the local area s or florida s economy could adversely affect tampa electric s or the peoples gas companies performance 
the activities of the diversified businesses  particularly teco transport and teco coal  are also affected by general economic conditions in the respective industries and geographic areas they serve  both nationally and internationally 
weather variations 
most of teco energy s businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather 
tampa electric s and the peoples gas companies energy sales are particularly sensitive to variations in weather conditions 
the teco energy companies forecast energy sales on the basis of normal weather  which represents a long term historical average 
significant variations from normal weather could have a material impact on energy sales 
unusual weather  such as hurricanes  could also have an effect on operating costs as well as sales 
peoples gas system and peoples gas company are more weather sensitive  with a single winter peak period  than tampa electric  with both summer and winter peak periods 
mild winter weather in florida can be expected to negatively impact results at the peoples gas companies 
variations in weather conditions also affect the demand and prices for the commodities sold by teco coalbed methane and teco coal 
teco transport also is impacted by weather because of its effects on the supply of and demand for the products transported 
severe weather conditions that could interrupt or slow service and increase operating costs also affects these businesses 
potential competitive changes 
the electric industry has been undergoing certain restructuring 
competition in wholesale power sales has been introduced on a national level 
some states have mandated or encouraged competition at the retail level  and in some situations required divestiture of generating assets 
while there is active wholesale competition in florida  the retail electric business has remained substantially free from direct competition 
changes in the competitive environment occasioned by legislation  regulation  market conditions or initiatives of other electric power providers  however  particularly with respect to retail competition  could adversely affect tampa electric s business and its performance 
the company s long range projections are based on its expectation that there will not be any significant change in tampa electric s competitive environment 
the gas distribution industry has been subject to competitive forces for several years 
further unbundling of gas service could adversely affect peoples gas system 
regulatory actions 
tampa electric and peoples gas system operate in highly regulated industries 
their retail operations  including the prices charged  are regulated by the fpsc  and tampa electric s wholesale power sales and transmission services are subject to regulation by ferc 
changes in regulatory requirements or adverse regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on tampa electric s or peoples gas system s performance 
commodity price changes 
most of teco energy s businesses are sensitive to changes in certain commodity prices 
such changes could affect the prices they charge  their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services 
in the case of tampa electric  fuel costs used for generation are mostly affected by the cost of coal 
tampa electric is able to recover the cost of fuel through retail customers bills  but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and therefore the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources 
on the wholesale side  the ability to make sales and the margins on power sales are affected by the cost of coal to tampa electric  particularly as it relates to the cost of gas and oil to other power producers 
in the case of peoples gas system  costs for purchased gas and pipeline capacity are recovered through retail customers bills  but increases in gas costs affect total retail prices and therefore the competitive position of peoples gas relative to electricity  other forms of energy and other gas suppliers 
at the diversified companies  changes in gas and coal prices directly affect the margins at teco coalbed methane  teco coal and teco transport 
teco coalbed methane is exposed to commodity price risk through the sale of natural gas 
a percent change in the market price of natural gas would not have a significant impact on teco energy s earnings 
teco coal is exposed to commodity price risk through coal sales 
a percent change in the market price of coal in any one year would not have a significant impact on teco energy s earnings for that year 
gas production levels 
results at teco coalbed methane are affected by its level of production which is declining 
the company s long range forecast assumes that production will decline approximately percent annually 
actual production levels may be greater or less than those assumed 
business growth opportunities 
part of the company s previously announced long term strategy is to grow its diversified business 
much of its targeted growth is dependent on the ability to find attractive acquisition and development opportunities and independent power p r o jects 
the company s long range forecast is based on its expectation that it will be successful in finding and capitalizing on these acquisition and development opportunities and independent power projects  but there can be no assurance that its efforts will be successful 
international risks 
teco power services is involved in several i n t e rnational projects and expects to enter into additional international projects during the next few years 
these projects involve numerous risks that are not present in domestic projects  including expropriation  political instability  currency exchange rate fluctuations  repatriation restrictions  and regulatory and legal uncertainties 
the company s long range forecast assumes that teco power services will mitigate losses associated with these risks through a variety of risk mitigation measures  including specific contractual provisions  teaming with strong international and local partners  obtaining limited recourse financing and  where appropriate  obtaining political risk insurance 
environmental matters 
teco energy s businesses are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities dealing with air  water and other environmental matters 
changes in compliance requirements or the interpretation by governmental authorities of existing requirements may impose additional costs on the company or result in the curtailment of some activities 
item a
