estimated cost to complete the development communities represents substantially all of the company s material commitments for capital expenditures at december  certain factors affecting the performance of development communities the company is optimistic about the operating prospects of the communities under construction even with the increased supply of newly constructed apartment homes of comparable quality in many of its markets 
as with any development community  there are uncertainties and risks associated with the development of the communities described above 
while the company has prepared development budgets and has estimated completion and stabilization target dates based on what it believes are reasonable assumptions in light of current conditions  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not exceed current budgets or that the company will not experience construction delays due to the unavailability of materials  weather conditions or other events 
other development risks include the possibility of incurring additional cost or liability resulting from defects in construction material and the possibility that financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all  to pursue or complete development activities 
similarly  market conditions at the time these communities become available for leasing will affect the rental rates that may be charged and the period of time necessary to achieve stabilization  which could make one or more of the development communities unprofitable or result in achieving stabilization later than currently anticipated 
in addition  the company is conducting feasibility and other pre development work for twelve potential communities 
the company could abandon the development of any one or more of these potential communities in the event that it determines that market conditions do not support development  financing is not available on favorable terms or other circumstances prevent development 
similarly  there can be no assurance that if the company does pursue one or more of these potential communities that it will be able to complete construction within the currently estimated development budgets or that construction can be started at the time currently anticipated 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the communities are for a term of one year or less  which coupled with the relatively high occupancy rates  may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation 
year year information and readiness disclosure act the company supports the exchange of information relating to the year issue and designates the following information as the year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
information set forth herein regarding the year compliance of non company products and services are republications under the year information and readiness disclosure act and are based on information supplied by other companies about the products and services they offer 
the company has not independently verified the contents of these republications and takes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of information contained in such republications 
introduction the securities and exchange commission has asked all public companies to provide disclosure regarding their year readiness 
the term year issue is a general term used to describe various problems that may result from the improper processing by computer systems of dates after these problems arise from the inability of some hardware and software to distinguish dates before the year from dates in and after the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and all organizations 
the company s efforts to address its year issues are focused in the following three areas i reviewing and taking any necessary steps to attempt to correct the company s computer information systems ie  software applications and hardware platforms  ii evaluating and making any necessary modifications to other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology  such as telecommunications  security  hvac  elevator  fire and safety systems  and iii communicating with certain significant third party service providers to determine whether there will be any interruption in their systems that could affect the company 
the company s state of readiness the company has developed a four phase plan to address its year issues its year plan 
the four phases are i awareness  ii assessment  iii remediation and implementation and iv testing 
awareness the company has made the relevant employees  including its property managers  aware of the year issue and collected information from such employees regarding systems that the company anticipates may be affected 
management will oversee the company s progress with respect to the implementation of its year plan 
in addition  the year plan will be subject to review of the audit committee of the board of directors 
assessment the company has substantially completed an assessment of its standard computer information systems and is now taking the further necessary steps to make its core computer information systems  in those situations in which the company is required to do so  year compliant 
see remediation and implementation below 
the company is in the process of attempting to obtain written verification from vendors to the effect that the company s other ie  non core standard computer information systems acquired from such vendors correctly distinguish dates before the year from dates in and after the year the company expects that it will receive such verifications  or a commitment from the relevant vendors to provide a solution  by no later than april  in addition  the company is currently evaluating and assessing its other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology  such as telecommunications  security  hvac  elevator  fire and safety systems  and expects that its assessment will be completed by the second quarter of the company is aware that such systems contain embedded chips that are difficult to identify and test and may require complete replacement because they cannot be repaired 
failure of the company to identify or remediate any embedded chips either on an individual or aggregate basis on which significant business operations depend  such as phone systems  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company rents apartments in its communities to individuals and does not have a single customer or group of customers who rents a significant number of apartments 
the company s primary purchases are building related products eg  carpets  paint and blinds and services eg  lawn care services  all of which are available from numerous suppliers 
the company s primary financial service providers are its primary bank and payroll processor 
the primary bank has provided written verification to the company that it will be year compliant 
the company implemented the payroll processor year upgrade in the fourth quarter of for the foregoing reasons  the company does not believe that there is a significant risk related to the failure of residents  vendors or third party goods or service providers to prepare for the year  however  the costs and timing of third party year compliance is not within the company s control and no assurances can be given with respect to the cost or timing of such efforts or the potential effects of any failure to comply 
remediation and implementation the company s primary uses of software systems are its corporate accounting and property management software 
the company s corporate accounting system is widely used in the real estate industry 
a version upgrade  installed in the second quarter of  is designed to be year compliant 
the company completed the replacement of its current property management software in october with a new software system that is also designed to be year compliant 
this new software is also widely used in the real estate industry 
the company has received written verification from the vendors of each of the corporate accounting and management systems that the relevant software is year compliant 
the company had previously planned both the upgrade of the corporate accounting system and implementation of the new property management system  and such changes would have been undertaken without regard to year remediation issues 
accordingly  the company has not deferred any planned information or software projects due to such year projects  and the company is not treating the costs of the above referenced changes as year related expenses 
testing to attempt to confirm that its computer systems are year compliant  the company expects to perform limited testing of its computer information systems and its other computer systems that do not relate to information technology but include embedded technology  however  unless year issues arise in the course of its limited testing  the company will rely on the written verification received from each vendor of its computer systems that the relevant system is year compliant 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the computer systems on which the company s business relies will correctly distinguish dates before the year from dates in and after the year any such failures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company began testing in the fourth quarter of and expects that its testing will be complete by march  costs to address the company s year issues based on current information from its review to date  the company budgeted  for the cost of repairing  updating and replacing its standard computer information systems 
because the company s year assessment is ongoing and additional funds may be required as a result of future findings  the company s current budget amounts may increase as a result of unanticipated delays or preparedness issues 
while the company s efforts to address its year issues will involve additional costs  the company believes  based on available information  that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company expects to fund the costs of addressing the year issue from cash flows resulting from operations 
while the company believes that it will be year compliant by december   if these efforts are not completed on time  or if the costs associated with updating or replacing the company s computer systems exceeds the company s estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks presented by year issues the company is still in the process of evaluating potential disruptions or complications that might result from year related problems  however  at this time the company has not identified any specific business functions that are likely to suffer material disruption as a result of year related events 
it is possible  however  that the company may identify business functions in the future that are specifically at risk of year disruption 
the absence of any such determination as of the date of this report represents only the company s current status of evaluating potential year related problems and facts presently known to the company  and should not be construed to mean that there is no risk of year related disruption 
moreover  due to the unique and pervasive nature of the year issue  it is not possible to anticipate each of the wide variety of year events  particularly outside of the company  that might arise in a worst case scenario which might have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s contingency plans the company intends to develop contingency plans for significant business risks identified by the company that might result from year related events 
because the company has not yet identified any specific business function that will be materially at risk of significant year related disruptions  and because a full assessment of the company s risk from potential year failures is still in process  the company has not yet developed detailed contingency plans specific to year problems 
in the event that the company concludes that one or more contingency plans are required  development of such contingency plans is currently scheduled to occur no later than june  or as otherwise appropriate 
funds from operations the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of nareit in march defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes funds from operations in accordance with the standards established by the white paper  which may differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations utilized by other equity reits  and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
funds available for distribution is defined as funds from operations less capital expenditures funded by operations recurring capital expenditures 
the company s methodology for calculating funds available for distribution may differ from the methodology for calculating funds available for distribution utilized by other reits  and accordingly  may not be comparable to other reits 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital expenditures or expansion  debt service obligations  property acquisitions  development  dividends and distributions or other commitments and uncertainties 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make dividends distributions 
the company believes funds from operations and funds available for distribution are helpful to investors as measures of the performance of the company because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  they provide investors with an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
funds from operations and funds available for distribution are calculated as follows dollars in thousands year ending december  net income    extraordinary items  net of minority interest minority interest of unitholders in operating partnership    net gain on sale of assets   adjusted net income    depreciation real estate assets    real estate joint venture funds from operations    recurring capital expenditures    funds available for distribution    non recurring capital expenditures    cash flow provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    weighted average shares and units outstanding basic    weighted average shares and units outstanding diluted    recurring capital expenditures are expected to be funded from operations and consist primarily of exterior painting  new appliances  vinyl  blinds  tile  and wallpaper 
in contrast  non recurring capital expenditures  such as major improvements  water submetering  new garages and access gates  are expected to be funded by financing activities and are therefore not included in the calculation of funds available for distribution 
non recurring capital expenditures include major renovations in the amount of million in and million in  million and  for water meters in and  respectively   and  for new signage in and  respectively   and  for fitness centers  key controls and other revenue enhancement items in and  respectively   and  for access gates and security fences in and  respectively   and  for washer dryer units in and  respectively  and  and  for improvement at properties acquired or disposed of in and  respectively
