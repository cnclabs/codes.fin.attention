results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased or million to million in fiscal from million in management believes the decrease in sales is attributable to increased product and price competition in the nutritional supplement market as well as increased competition for new distributors 
in addition  sales growth was negatively impacted by the reduction in market demand for several herbal products  resulting in depressed market prices 
the company expects competition to remain strong for the foreseeable future 
sales of products by our customers into international markets increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily the result of existing customers continued expansion into asian and european markets through their international distribution channels 
management believes that the expansion into international markets should continue and net sales to these markets should increase as a percentage of total net sales 
for the year ended june   the company experienced an increase in cost of goods sold  as a percentage of sales  to compared to for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to liquidation of excess or slow moving inventories at or below cost and inventory write downs to net realizable values  caused by depressed market prices due to reduced industry demand 
the increase in cost of goods sold resulted in a reduction of gross profit margins to in fiscal compared to in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to in from in  increasing in absolute dollars to million in fiscal from million in the percentage increase was due primarily to the fixed nature of selling  general and administrative expenses and the decrease in net sales as noted above 
the increase in absolute dollars was due to upgrades in systems and computers related to yk compliance  expenses related to management restructuring  and higher rents in connection with entering into additional leases for new blending  warehousing and packaging facilities 
additionally  professional fees increased because of increased activity in seeking additional manufacturing agreements

in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a million charge for impairment of leasehold assets and an accrual of million representing the present value of the excess of future lease payments over estimated sub lease income 
the company is seeking tenants for the facility 
the company s loss from operations was approximately million compared to income from operations of million in this was due to an approximate million decrease in gross profit  approximately million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  and the approximate million provision for loss on lease obligation and other expense 
the company incurred a net loss for fiscal of approximately million compared to net income of million in fiscal this loss was due to the reasons described above 
diluted loss per common share was 
in fiscal compared to diluted earnings per common share of in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased or million to million in fiscal the company added several new customers in the latter part of fiscal and sales to these and other new customers was the primary reason for the increase 
a decrease in sales to certain existing customers was offset by increases in international sales to other existing customers through their international distribution channels 
sales of products into international markets increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of existing customers expanding into asian and european markets 
income from operations increased to million in this was due to a million increase in gross profit offset by a 
million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross profit margins were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the gross profit margin was substantially below historical margins because of the following factors shifts in product sales mix toward lower profit margin products  rising costs of certain raw materials  increased costs for subcontracted packaging  change in ownership of a customer that resulted in a substantial write off of packaging materials  and the write off of raw materials that became obsolete because of customer discontinuance of certain products 
the gross profit margin was slightly higher than historical margins experienced before the increase is principally due to negotiated raw material savings and improved manufacturing cost efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to in from in  while increasing in absolute dollars to approximately million in fiscal from million in the majority of this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due to an increase in employee benefits expense which increased because the defined benefit pension plan adopted as of january  was in effect for a full year in additionally  professional fees increased in part because of increased activity in the registration of foreign products 
these increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a decline in bad debt expense  which was attributable to a related party customer write off in fiscal  and a decline in royalty expense because the company s agreement with the united states olympic committee expired in march net other income expense was approximately  in fiscal compared approximately  in fiscal part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal compared to fiscal continued net earnings increased by or million to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the reasons given above and was partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate 
the higher effective income tax rate  from in to in  was the result of a smaller investment credit applicable to california franchise taxes 
diluted earnings per share increased to per share in from 
per share in year issues the year issue year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to represent the year and affects both information technology it and non it systems 
thus  computer software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including among others  a temporary inability to process certain data or engage in similar normal business activities 
status the company s plan to resolve the year issue involved four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the company completed its assessment of its it systems and implemented its new computer software system during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 
the manufacturer represents this system as year compliant 
the company also completed its assessment of non it systems  most of which are equipment used in production 
systems identified as not being year compliant were brought into compliance by upgrading either the software or hardware 
the company fully implemented these upgrades by the end of its fiscal year 
the company has determined that its production equipment and alarm  heating  and air conditioning systems will not be affected by the year the company s computer staff has queried its significant suppliers  vendors and other outside parties and none of the responses received thus far have indicated any significant deficiencies 
the company will continue to monitor their year compliance status  but has no means of ensuring that suppliers  vendors and other outside parties will be year ready 
the company s most likely worst case scenario is the inability of suppliers  vendors and other outside parties including the government to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion  which could materially impact the company 
the effect of non compliance by suppliers  vendors and outside parties is not determinable 
costs the company incurred approximately million in costs  of which approximately  was charged directly to expense in the fiscal year to replace its financial and manufacturing software systems and to remediate or replace embedded microprocessors in its production equipment 
the company funded its costs from current funds available from operations 
if  however  additional unanticipated costs are incurred  this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks while management of the company believes it effectively implemented its program to resolve the year issue in a timely manner  as noted above  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely effect the company 
the company is unable to estimate if it has any potential liability or potential lost revenue at this time 
there can be no assurance that the company will not discover year compliance issues that will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the company has historically met its working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including funding for expansion of operations  mainly through net cash provided by operating activities 
in addition  the company has utilized revolving lines of credit and equipment financing and leases 
management plans to pursue additional financing during its fiscal year to provide the resources necessary to meet currently anticipated funding requirements 
there can be no assurance such financing will be available or if it is  on what terms  and if obtained  that it will be adequate to provide resources necessary to meet current requirements 
at june   the company had working capital of  and borrowings available under revolving lines of credit of  as of june   there were no borrowings under these lines 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately  compared to approximately  for the net loss was offset by the cumulative effect of a provision for loss on a lease obligation  a decrease in accounts receivable  and a decrease in inventories less the cumulative effect of an increase in deferred income taxes  an increase in tax refund receivable  and a decrease in accounts payable 
current maturities of long term debt amounted to  which the company expects to pay out of working capital 
the company has revolving lines of credit permitting borrowings up to  which are secured by the company s receivables  inventory  equipment  and vehicles and bear interest at the bank s prime rate 
these agreements contain financial covenants concerning limitations on maintenance of debt  certain financial ratios and other matters 
the lines of credit expire on january   management expects such lines to be renewed in the normal course of business 
the company received a waiver for certain debt covenants for which it was not compliant as of june  capital expenditures for amounted to approximately million 
these expenditures relate to building improvements for the company s new warehouse and blending facility  the purchase of production and packaging equipment to expand the company s output capacity  and leasehold improvements in the carlsbad facility  which were written off in the third quarter 
the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal these expenditures are expected to be paid from a combination of cash holdings  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  borrowings under the company s lines of credit with its bank  and anticipated additional financings 
if these financing alternatives become unavailable  the company may be required to defer or restrict certain commercial activities or delay or eliminate expenditures for certain of its potential products and or markets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to risks relating to changes in interest rates and stock market fluctuations 
at june   the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of government backed money market funds  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
the company also maintains a short term investment portfolio containing common stocks that are subject to market risk 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company believes that its investment in market risk sensitive instruments is not material 
market rate risk related to long term debt is diminimus due to the fixed interest rate and fixed payment structure of the debt 
risk factors government regulation the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling and advertising of the company s products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies  including the united states food and drug administration fda  the federal trade commission ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the united states department of agriculture  the united states postal service  the united states environmental protection agency and the occupational safety and health administration 
these activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which the company s products are sold 
in particular  the fda regulates the safety  labeling and distribution of dietary supplements  including vitamins  minerals  herbs food  otc and prescription drugs and cosmetics 
the regulations that are promulgated by the fda relating to the manufacturing process are known as food products 
in addition  the ftc has overlapping jurisdiction with the fda to regulate the labeling  promotion and advertising of vitamins  otc drugs  cosmetics and foods 
the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea was enacted on october  dshea amends the federal food  drug and cosmetic act by defining dietary supplements which include vitamins  minerals  nutritional supplements and herbs  as a new category of food separate from conventional food 
dshea provides a regulatory framework to ensure safe  quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products 
under dshea  the fda is generally prohibited from regulating the active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims  such as claims that a product may heal  mitigate  cure or prevent an illness  disease or malady  trigger drug status 
part ii risk factors continued dshea provides for specific nutritional labeling requirements for dietary supplements and the fda s final regulations require that all dietary supplements must be labeled in compliance with the regulations by no later than march  dshea permits substantiated  truthful and non misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling  such as statements describing general well being resulting from consumption of a dietary ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining a structure or function of the body 
the company anticipates the fda will finalize cgmps that are specific to dietary supplements and require at least some of the quality control provisions contained in the cgmps for drugs 
the company currently manufactures its vitamins and nutritional supplement products in compliance with the applicable food cgmps 
the fda has finalized some of its regulations  including those relating to nutritional labeling requirements 
the fda also has under development additional regulations to implement dshea 
final labeling regulations may require expanded or different labeling for the company s vitamin and nutritional products 
the company cannot determine what effect such regulations  when fully implemented  will have on its business in the future 
such regulations could  among other things  require the recall  reformulation or discontinuance of certain products  additional recordkeeping  warnings  notification procedures and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products or scientific substantiation regarding ingredients  product claims  safety or efficacy 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements can result in sanctions being imposed on the company or the manufacturers of its products  including warning letters  fines  product recalls and seizures 
governmental regulations in foreign countries where the company plans to commence or expand sales may prevent or delay entry into a market or prevent or delay the introduction  or require the reformulation of  certain of the company s products 
in addition  the company cannot predict whether new domestic or foreign legislation regulating its activities will be enacted 
such new legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company 
effect of adverse publicity the company s products consist of vitamins  minerals  herbs and other ingredients that the company regards as safe when taken as suggested by the company 
in addition  various scientific studies have suggested the ingredients in some of the company s products may involve health benefits 
the company believes the growth in the vitamin product business of the last several years may be based on material media attention and various scientific research suggesting potential health benefits for the consumption of certain vitamin products 
the company is highly dependent upon its customers and consumers perception of the overall integrity of its business  as well as the safety and quality of its products and similar products distributed by other companies which may not adhere to the same quality standards as the company 
the company could be adversely affected if any of the company s products or any similar products distributed by other companies should prove or be asserted to be harmful to consumers or should scientific studies provide unfavorable findings regarding the effectiveness of products similar to those produced by the company 
centralized location of manufacturing operations the company currently manufactures the vast majority of its products at its manufacturing facilities in san marcos  california 
accordingly  any event resulting in the slowdown or stoppage of the company s manufacturing operations or distribution facilities in san marcos could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company maintains business interruption insurance 
there can be no assurance  however  that such insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or  if available  will be adequate to cover any losses that may be incurred from an interruption in the company s manufacturing and distribution operations 
part ii risk factors continued reliance on certain customers and certain products in fiscal  nuskin international  nsa international and pharmavite accounted for approximately of the company s sales 
each of the company s other major customers accounted for less than of the company s sales for fiscal if one or more of the company s major customers substantially reduced their volume of purchases from the company  or if consumer s purchases of vitamins were substantially reduced  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
distribution and management of operations in fiscal  the company leased and initiated development of two additional facilities comprising  square feet in vista  california  to be used as warehousing  mixing  blending and packaging facilities 
the company also elected to sublease and not occupy an  square foot building in carlsbad  california  developed specifically for the company 
in addition  the company organized a european subsidiary that leased and developed a  square foot manufacturing facility in lugano  switzerland 
during fiscal  the company also implemented an entirely new software system to manage its materials and manufacturing operations 
while the company believes that these activities will increase the company s manufacturing and distribution capabilities  there can be no assurance the expected operating improvements will be realized or that these efforts will result in improved sales profit margins or earnings 
a significant  unexpected disruption during the implementation of these systems and facilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
potential for increased competition the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company competes with other vitamin product and otc pharmaceuticals manufacturers 
among other factors  competition among these manufacturers is based upon price 
if one or more manufacturers significantly reduce their prices in an effort to gain market share  the company s results of operations or market position could be adversely affected 
certain of the company s competitors  particularly manufacturers of nationally advertised brand name products  are larger and have resources substantially greater than those of the company 
much speculation has also been made about the potential for increased participation in these markets by major international pharmaceutical companies 
in the future  one or more of these companies could seek to compete more directly with the company by manufacturing and distributing their own or others products or by significantly lowering the prices of their national brand products 
the company sells substantially all of its vitamin products to customers who sell and distribute the products 
although the company does not currently participate significantly in other channels such as health food stores  direct mail  internet sales and direct sales  the company may expand its operations and its products may face competition from such alternative channels as more customers utilize these channels of distribution to obtain vitamin products 
reliance on certain suppliers  availability and cost of purchased materials the company purchases from third party suppliers raw materials and certain products that the company does not manufacture 
although the company currently has supply arrangements with several suppliers of these ingredients and products  and the company s purchased materials are generally available from numerous sources  an unexpected interruption of supply could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
part ii risk factors continued exposure to product liability claims the company  like other retailers  distributors and manufacturers of products that are ingested  faces a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of its products results in injury 
the company maintains product liability coverage in the amount of million  including primary product liability and excess liability coverage with deductibles of  per claim 
there can be no assurance product liability insurance will continue to be available at an economically reasonable cost or that the company s insurance will be adequate to cover liability the company incurs in respect to product liability claims 
see also item legal proceedings and product liability 
reliance on key management the operation of the company requires managerial and operational expertise 
the company does not have long term employment contracts with any of its executives 
if  for any reason  key personnel do not continue to be active in the company management  operations could be adversely affected 
risks associated with international markets the company s growth may be dependent in part upon its ability to expand its operations and those of its customers into new markets  including international markets 
the company may experience difficulty entering new international markets due to greater regulatory barriers  the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems and problems related to entering new markets with different cultural bases and political systems 
operating in international markets exposes the company to certain risks  including  among other things  changes in or interpretations of foreign import  currency transfer and other restrictions and regulations that among other things may limit the company s ability to sell certain products or repatriate profits to the united states  exposure to currency fluctuations  the potential imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions or increased tariffs  and economic and political instability 
as the company continues to expand its international operations  these and other risks associated with international operations are likely to increase 
litigation involving products containing certain raw materials there can be no assurance that the company will not be named in actions in the future seeking damages for alleged personal injuries resulting from the ingestion of certain products  and result in the company becoming a defendant in multiple actions and such an event could have a material adverse impact on the company 
concentration of ownership  certain anti takeover considerations the company s directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these shareholders will continue to have the ability to substantially influence the management  policies and business operations of the company 
the company s board of directors has the authority to approve the issuance of  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the company s shareholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
certain provisions of delaware law  as well as the issuance of preferred stock  and other anti takeover provisions in the company s articles and bylaws  could delay or inhibit the removal of incumbent directors and could delay  defer  make more difficult or prevent a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  or any change in control involving the company  as well as the removal of management  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of the company s shareholders  and may limit the price certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock 
part ii risk factors continued volatility of stock price the company s stock price has experienced significant volatility over the past two fiscal years 
moreover  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
market conditions in the vitamin and nutritional supplement industry and factors such as announcements of new products by the company  its competitors or third parties  and changes in earnings estimates by analysts  may have a significant effect on the price of the common stock
