item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in connection with the company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview the company is a regional freight railroad operating in massachusetts  rhode island  connecticut and new york 
the company generates operating revenues primarily from the movement of freight in both conventional freight cars and in intermodal containers on flat cars over its rail lines 
freight revenues are recorded at the time delivery is made to the customer or the connecting carrier 
modest non freight operating revenues are derived from demurrage  switching  weighing  special train and other transportation services as well as from services rendered to freight customers and other outside parties by the company s maintenance of way  communications and signals  and maintenance of equipment departments 
operating revenues also include amortization of deferred grant income 
the company s operating expenses consist of salaries and wages and related payroll taxes and employee benefits  depreciation and amortization  insurance and casualty claim expense  diesel fuel  car hire  property taxes  materials and supplies  purchased services and other expenses 
many of the company s operating expenses are of a relatively fixed nature and do not increase or decrease proportionately with increases or decreases in operating revenues unless the company s management takes specific actions to restructure the company s operations 
when comparing the company s results of operations from one year to another  the following factors should be taken into consideration 
first  the company has historically experienced fluctuations in operating revenues and expenses due to unpredictable events such as one time freight moves and customer plant expansions and shut downs 
second  the company s freight volumes are susceptible to increases and decreases due to changes in international  national and regional economic conditions 
third  the volume of capitalized track or recollectable projects performed by the company s maintenance of way and communications and signals departments can vary significantly from year to year thereby impacting total operating expenses 
the company also generates income through sales of properties  grants of easements and licenses  and leases of land and tracks 
income or loss from sale  condemnation and disposal of property and equipment and grants of easements is recorded at the time the transaction is consummated and collectibility is assured 
this income varies significantly from year to year the company has one customer  tilcon connecticut  inc  which accounted for approximately  and of its operating revenues in  and  respectively 
the company does not believe that this customer will cease to be a rail shipper or will significantly decrease its freight volume in the foreseeable future 
in the event that this customer should cease or significantly reduce its rail freight operations  management believes that the company could restructure its operations to reduce operating costs by an amount sufficient to offset the decrease in operating revenues

total intermodal containers handled increased by  or  to  containers in from  containers in the average rate received per intermodal container increased slightly due to rate increases attributable to increases in certain railroad industry cost indices 
ii conventional freight revenues remained relatively unchanged between years despite the fact that the company s conventional freight carloadings decreased by  or  to  carloadings in from  carloadings in the average revenue received per conventional carloading increased by a comparable percentage  however  due to a shift in the relative volume of commodities handled toward higher revenue commodities 
the company s conventional freight volume was adversely affected during the latter part of by the global recession  which resulted in reduced shipments of scrap metal and us made steel 
in addition  delayed award of highway construction projects caused a decline in shipments of construction aggregate used in the production of asphalt 
scrap metal and construction aggregates command a comparatively lower freight rate than many of the other commodities handled by the company 
decreases in these commodities were partially offset by increases in volumes of inbound raw materials to many of the company s manufacturing customers 
such traffic volumes increased by approximately in and reflect a revitalization of the southern new england manufacturing base as well as the company s successful marketing efforts 
the  increase in non freight operating revenues resulted primarily from increases in maintenance of way department billings 
such revenues can vary from year to year depending upon the needs of rail customers and other outside parties

other income other income increased million to million in from  in this increase is due primarily to an increase in gains from the sales of property and easements  principally million derived from the sale of fiber optics cable licenses 
in addition the company received million in as an interim payment relating to an environmental claim paid by the company in prior years

the average rate received per intermodal container increased slightly due to rate increases attributable to increases in certain railroad industry cost indices 
the company experienced increases in shipments by many of the company s freight customers  attributable primarily to improved national and regional economic conditions as well as the company s marketing efforts 
the increase also reflected the addition of several new customers utilizing the company s rail services 
the  increase in non freight operating revenues resulted primarily from increases in maintenance of way department billings and from special train and other transportation revenues 
such revenues can vary significantly from year to year depending upon customer needs 
operating expenses operating expenses increased  or  to million in from million in operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues operating ratio  however  decreased to in from in the small increase in operating expenses and the decrease in the operating ratio were attributable to the relatively fixed nature of the company s operating expenses and the fact that capitalized costs for track and bridge projects as well as costs recovered from government grants for public improvements  such as surfacing and signals for grade crossings  increased million  or  to million in from million in casualties and insurance expense decreased  or  to  in from  in  principally due to the absence of any expenditures in for casualty losses in excess of amounts previously reserved 
casualty loss expense was  in purchased services and track and signal materials expense increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to the increased capital projects and cost recovery programs carried out in other income other income decreased million  or  to  in from million in  due primarily to a decrease in net gains from the sale  condemnation and disposal of properties and easements 
the amount reflected a million condemnation award 
interest expense interest expense was virtually unchanged between and interest on approximately  of debt incurred to finance the acquisition of three locomotives during the second quarter of was essentially offset by interest reductions resulting from principal payments on existing indebtedness

the company holds various properties which could be made available for sale  lease or grants of easements and licenses 
revenues from sales of properties  easements and licenses can vary significantly from year to year 
the company completed secondary public offerings of  newly issued shares of its common stock in march and  shares in october net proceeds from these offerings totaled million 
these funds  along with proceeds from sales of properties  easements and licenses  were utilized to retire all of the company s long and short term borrowings and for acquisitions of equipment 
the company intends to utilize the remaining proceeds from these offerings of approximately million to expand its worcester ma maintenance facility and for general corporate purposes including the possible acquisition of other connecting railroads  rail lines and trackage rights  equipment additions  and infrastructure improvements 
the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of conn central on april  while the company is not able to predict the total impact of this acquisition upon future operations  carloadings and freight revenues of  were generated from former conn central rail freight customers during the period from april through december  in addition  the company intends to pursue growth opportunities on the acquired lines 
in june  the company s principal bank renewed the company s revolving line of credit and increased the maximum borrowings allowed by  to million 
in addition  borrowings under the line are now unsecured and bear interest at either the prime rate or one and one half per cent over either the one or three month london interbank offered rates 
the company does not pay any commitment fee on this line 
the company had no advances against the line of credit during the second  third or fourth quarters of substantially all of the mainline track owned by the company meets fra class standards permitting freight train speeds of miles per hour  and the company intends to continue to maintain this track at this level 
the company expended million  million and million for track structure and bridge improvements in  and respectively 
deferred grant income of  in   in and  in financed a portion of these improvements 
in addition  the company received  of grant proceeds in to purchase track materials for a three year track improvement project commenced in  which the company expects to complete by the track materials were purchased during and are included in materials and supplies on the accompanying balance sheets 
management estimates that approximately million of improvements to the company s track structure and bridges will be made in  provided that sufficient funds  including grant proceeds  are available 
improvements to the company s track structure are made  for the most part  by the company s maintenance of way department personnel 
in  the company paid dividends in the amount of per share aggregating  on its outstanding preferred stock and per share aggregating  on its outstanding common stock 
continued payment of such dividends is contingent upon the company s continuing to have the necessary financial resources available 
the company believes that expected cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from financing activities will be sufficient to fund the company s capital requirements for at least the next months 
to the extent that the company is successful in consummating acquisitions or implementing its expansion plans  it may be necessary to finance such acquisitions or expansion plans through the issuance of additional equity securities  incurrence of indebtedness or both 
inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
seasonality historically  the company s operating revenues are lowest for the first quarter due to the absence of construction aggregate shipments during this period and to winter weather conditions 
year compliance the company operates a mainframe computer with a pc network and employs three in house programmers who write and maintain a substantial portion of the ii company s software programs 
the company utilizes electronic data interchange and interline settlement systems through railinc in washington  dc for the interchange of rail cars and revenue allocations with other railroads 
the company has compatible back up mainframe systems at both its worcester  ma and plainfield  ct facilities 
the company has completed an analysis of its information technology and other operating systems to determine which may be impacted by year issues 
based on this analysis  preparation for the year have been underway for six years and changes to the company s information technology are substantially complete 
the company s other non information technology systems have also been evaluated and no year issues have been identified 
modifications to the company s information technology programs have been performed by internal staff with the associated costs incorporated into the company s annual operating budgets and  therefore  such costs are not separately identifiable 
no material additional costs are anticipated at this time 
due to the short periodic cycle of rail car movements  the exchange of data covers time periods where year compliance is not a major factor and should not adversely affect the company s ability to operate 
the company relies on waybills and car supply and revenue data generated by other railroads in the interchange of rail cars 
the failure of these railroads to supply accurate data could disrupt the company s operations 
however  railinc with whom the majority of these railroads interface electronically  has informed the company that it is currently addressing the year issue and expects to be year compliant by mid the company believes that any modifications to its programs resulting from railinc changes will be minimal and that such changes can be readily made 
the company s contingency plan in the event other parties should be unable to provide year compliant electronic data is to revert to paper documentation from these parties 
however  to the extent that customers  connecting carriers or other entities with which the company has material relationships do not adequately address year issues  the company could experience payment delays and service disruptions which could materially adversely affect its operations
