operating income for the k publishing segment increased million  or  to million in from million in the resulting operating margin for was compared to in the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to the increase in editorial costs incurred for product revisions and new product development and a change in the mix of products sold  which included a higher percent of revenues from products with lower margins 
increased selling expense also contributed to this decrease 
higher selling expense was related to the cost of preparing for anticipated sales opportunities in the year over year increase in administrative expense as a percent of sales was primarily due to additional costs related to information systems initiatives and the year computer issue and the inclusion of gains recorded on the sales of property in  which  in turn  lowered administrative expense in the k publishing segment s net sales of million in represented a million  or  increase over net sales of million

liquidity and capital resources houghton mifflin s principal businesses are seasonal  with almost of its revenues derived from educational publishing in the k and college publishing segments  markedly seasonal businesses 
houghton mifflin realizes more than of net sales and a substantial portion of net income during the third quarter and characteristically posts a net loss in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this sales seasonality affects houghton mifflin s operating cash flow 
houghton mifflin normally incurs a net cash deficit from all of its activities through the middle of the third quarter of the year 
houghton mifflin funds the deficit through the draw down of cash and marketable securities  supplemented by short term borrowings  principally commercial paper

in august  houghton mifflin redeemed  or million in aggregate principal amount  of its outstanding sails 
the sails were redeemed at an exchange rate equal to i two shares of the common stock of inso  par value per share  for each sails  or approximately million shares  and ii cash of million for the payment of accrued and unpaid interest at the date of the redemption 
the remaining  or million in aggregate principal amount  of the outstanding sails is due on august  and therefore has been classified as current debt outstanding 
the principal amount of each outstanding sails will be mandatorily exchanged for a number of shares of inso common stock or  at houghton mifflin s option  cash with an equal value 
if houghton mifflin chooses to redeem the sails with shares of inso common stock  it would record a gain or loss representing the difference between the redemption amount and the book value of houghton mifflin s investment in inso 
under the terms of the sails agreement  the number of shares that would be exchanged for the sails depends on the fair market value of inso common stock on the redemption date 
if the price of one share of inso common stock is equal to or less than  then approximately million shares would be exchanged 
between and per share  the number of shares that would be exchanged decreases from million to million 
at or more per share for inso common stock  houghton mifflin would exchange million shares 
houghton mifflin would record as non cash interest expense over the remaining term of the sails the excess of the market value of the current inso common stock price over the maximum redemption price of per inso share 
based upon inso s december  stock price  there is no additional non cash interest expense to be recorded through august the inso shares may be sold by houghton mifflin  subject to certain restrictions  as market conditions and events warrant 
at december   houghton mifflin has a million unsecured revolving credit facility  the revolving credit facility  for which houghton mifflin pays annual commitment fees 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are outstanding under a five year revolving commitment which expires on october  this credit facility requires houghton mifflin to comply with certain covenants  the most restrictive of which include maintenance of a specific level of net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio  and debt to equity ratio 
at december   the outstanding balance on this credit facility was million  at a weighted average interest rate of 
no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility at december  management routinely evaluates interest rates available to houghton mifflin under the revolving credit facility as compared to those available through the issuance of commercial paper 
the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility of million has been excluded from current liabilities at december  because houghton mifflin intends that at least that amount would remain outstanding under the revolving credit facility  or would be issued as additional commercial paper  for an uninterrupted period extending beyond one year from the balance sheet date 
houghton mifflin currently expects that cash flow from operations for the full year will be sufficient to cover investment activities and dividend payments as well as to repay by year end a portion of the debt outstanding at the beginning of houghton mifflin intends to continue using the short term debt market  primarily commercial paper  for seasonal liquidity needs 
pending accounting pronouncements in  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which must be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december   and the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities  which must be adopted for fiscal years beginning after june  houghton mifflin is currently evaluating the effects of implementing these statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices although inflation is currently well below levels in prior years and has  therefore  benefited recent houghton mifflin results  particularly in the area of manufacturing costs  there are offsetting costs 
houghton mifflin s ability to adjust selling prices has always been limited by competitive factors and long term contractual arrangements which either prohibit price increases or limit the amount by which prices may be increased 
further  a weak domestic economy at a time of low inflation could cause lower tax receipts at the state and local level  and the funding and buying patterns for textbooks and other educational materials could be adversely affected 
prices for paper have moderated in and houghton mifflin expects this trend to continue in the most significant investments affected by inflation include book plates  other property  plant  and equipment  and inventories 
houghton mifflin uses the last in  first out lifo method to value substantially all inventory and  therefore  the cost of inventory charged against income approximates replacement value 
the incremental replacement cost expense amounted to million in compared with million in houghton mifflin s publishing business requires a high level of investment in book plates for its educational and reference works  which represented approximately of total assets at december   and  increasingly in other property  plant  and equipment  which represented of consolidated assets at december  houghton mifflin continues to commit funds to the publishing areas through both internal growth and acquisitions 
houghton mifflin believes that by valuing its inventory using the lifo method  continuing to emphasize technological improvements  and quality control  it can continue to moderate the impact of inflation on its operating results and financial position 
acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of cat in july  houghton mifflin wrote off in process research and development totaling million in the third quarter of the charge was necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use 
this amount represents an allocation of the purchase price related to an application module called cat software system version this project represents an integrated application suite of products whose functionality includes test development  automated assembly and test production  test administration  scoring  automated test reporting  and test security 
houghton mifflin anticipates that the product using the acquired in process research and development will be released during houghton mifflin expects that the acquired in process research and development will be successfully developed  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of this product will be achieved 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in process research and development into a commercially viable product principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the value of the acquired in process research and development was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to the product and the stage of completion of the product 
these cash flows were discounted to the net present value 
the resulting projected net cash flows from the project were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the product 
the revenue estimates used to value the in process research and development were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in the related technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by houghton mifflin and its competitors 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to the net present value were based on a discount rate of 
this discount rate takes into account the time value of money and investment risks factors described above 
the estimates used by houghton mifflin in valuing the in process research and development were based upon assumptions houghton mifflin believes to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
houghton mifflin s assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
any such variances may adversely affect the sales and profitability of future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets may become impaired 
outlook houghton mifflin s revenue opportunities in the k market in are expected to be greater than in due to an increase in statewide adoption opportunities  as well as additional funding available at the state level for educational and assessment materials 
included in the sales growth will be sales generated from the science discipline in the elementary school market due to the discoveryworks acquisition in december all other divisions are also expected to have growth opportunities  and houghton mifflin expects sales to increase in by approximately 
houghton mifflin anticipates that the sales growth will generate increased gross margin  which will be partially offset by increased investment in products and support systems and higher selling expense in houghton mifflin expects editorial expense and plate amortization to increase by approximately 
these increases are related to investment in product revisions and new products and services to take advantage of statewide adoption opportunities in the k publishing segment in through  including a significant investment to revise the science program 
houghton mifflin also expects selling expense in the second half of to increase due to the increase in statewide adoption opportunities in houghton mifflin will also continue to invest to improve operating and support systems and to comply with year computer requirements 
these investments will help maintain market leading product lines  as well as improve efficiency  profitability  and service to customers 
houghton mifflin expects the cost of investments in new computer systems and year compliance in to be approximately million higher than in effect of the year computer issue the statements in this section are year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the year computer issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of houghton mifflin s computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  ship products  or engage in similar normal business activities 
in addition to hardware and software  the year computer issue may also affect printers  facsimile machines  security systems  elevators  and other systems that are controlled by microprocessors 
the year computer issue will affect houghton mifflin  its vendors and suppliers  customers  and other third parties with whom houghton mifflin does business 
to address this issue  houghton mifflin has created a plan under the direction of a program management office  which consists of a team of houghton mifflin personnel and third party consultants 
the phases of the plan include assessment  remediation or replacement  testing and certification  and implementation 
as part of this effort  the program management office provides regular updates to management and the board of directors  as well as information bulletins to the entire company 
houghton mifflin is focusing on the following four areas of exposure information technology  non information technology  or non it systems for example  climate control systems  copy machines  security systems  etc  technology products sold by houghton mifflin  and third party relationships 
houghton mifflin is using the status of completion method to evaluate its progress on the year computer issue 
this method compares the level of effort necessary to complete the task with the level of effort expended to date 
houghton mifflin has completed its evaluation of the year readiness of cat  which was acquired in july some expected completion dates have been extended to reflect cat s state of readiness  and the following disclosure includes the effect of cat upon houghton mifflin s year readiness 
information technology includes mainframe applications  client server applications  end user applications  infrastructure hardware and software  and networks and voice systems 
houghton mifflin has completed the assessment of all information technology systems that it believes could be significantly affected by the year computer issue  and has determined that it will have to modify or replace significant portions of its software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the assessment also showed that for certain older systems  such as customer order management  accounts receivable  royalty  and human resources  complete replacement of the applications is the best alternative 
complete replacement will not only remediate the year computer issue but will expand the current system capabilities and provide a platform for houghton mifflin s future growth 
the following chart excluding the customer order management system presents the estimated average status of completion for this area  and the expected completion date for each phase 
estimated expected average completion resolution phase completion date assessment completed remediation or replacement july  testing and certification august  implementation august  the expected completion date of the customer order management system has been extended due to an increase in the scope of work to complete the project 
houghton mifflin has completed the assessment phase of this system and is approximately complete with the replacement phase 
the replacement  testing  and implementation phases are expected to be completed by october  houghton mifflin is also developing a contingency plan for this system  which includes remediation of the existing system 
the following chart presents the estimated average status of completion for critical non it systems and the expected completion date of each phase 
estimated expected average completion resolution phase completion date assessment completed remediation or replacement completed testing and certification june  implementation june  houghton mifflin is also in the process of assessing the compliance of its technology product lines by testing the products in a year compliant environment 
the test results will determine any required action  including remediation  replacement  or retirement 
in most cases  houghton mifflin believes there will be no need for remediation or replacement of the product 
houghton mifflin expects to complete this assessment by march  and believes that it will be able to complete any appropriate remedial actions by december  based upon preliminary results  houghton mifflin does not expect that the effect of year issues on houghton mifflin s technology products presents a material exposure 
houghton mifflin has identified its most important customers  suppliers  and business partners for example  printers  paper suppliers  distributors  and financial institutions  and has contacted them to determine the extent to which houghton mifflin may be vulnerable in the event that those parties fail to properly correct their own year computer issues 
houghton mifflin is monitoring the responses and progress of these parties 
in addition  houghton mifflin intends to test critical systems interfaces  such as order and inventory transactions 
houghton mifflin is in the process of working with the parties with whom it has these interfaces to reduce the risk of business interruptions 
to date  houghton mifflin is not aware of any third party whose year issues would have a material effect on houghton mifflin  but has no independent means of ensuring that third parties will be year ready or whether their remediation efforts will be compatible with those of houghton mifflin 
houghton mifflin is using both internal and external resources to reprogram or replace and test software for year modifications 
management currently expects the total cost of the year computer project  including costs to enhance the functionality of certain systems as well as to address the year computer issue  to be approximately million  which is being funded through operating cash flows 
of this total  approximately million is for the purchase of new software and hardware that will be capitalized 
the remaining million will be expensed as incurred 
as of december   houghton mifflin has spent approximately million million expensed and million capitalized for new systems on its year computer project and the development of new systems and systems modifications 
houghton mifflin believes that it has an effective program in place to resolve any year computer issues in a timely manner 
although houghton mifflin has not yet completed all the necessary phases of its year program  it believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year computer issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made or are not completed in time  or if a material third party fails to properly remediate its computer problems  or if the costs are higher than expected  the year computer issue could have a material effect on houghton mifflin s operations 
while houghton mifflin is not currently aware of any significant exposure  it cannot be sure that all year remediation processes will be completed and properly tested before the year  or that contingency plans will be sufficient to mitigate the risk of all forms of year readiness problems for houghton mifflin and its significant customers  suppliers  and business partners 
in the event that houghton mifflin or any of its material suppliers or other third parties do not complete the necessary remediation  houghton mifflin could be subject to interruption of its normal business activities  including its ability to take customer orders  manufacture and ship products  invoice customers  collect payments  or engage in similar routine operations  and there could be a material adverse effect on houghton mifflin s revenues 
houghton mifflin could also be subject to litigation for computer systems failures or problems with its technology products 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from the year computer issue could materially adversely affect houghton mifflin 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenues cannot reasonably be estimated at this time 
to prepare for the possibility that it or a third party may be unable to remediate or replace and properly test critical systems on a timely basis  houghton mifflin will develop appropriate contingency plans after its assessment of risk is complete 
houghton mifflin has prepared preliminary contingency plans for many of its information technology systems and will develop final plans during for those areas houghton mifflin determines are at risk 
the projected costs and the dates on which houghton mifflin believes it will complete the year computer modifications are based on its best estimates which  in turn  were based on numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans  and other factors  many of which are not subject to houghton mifflin s control 
houghton mifflin cannot be sure that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
there are many factors that could affect the accuracy of these estimates  including the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  the ability of third parties to resolve their own year computer issues  and other uncertainties referred to from time to time in houghton mifflin s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk houghton mifflin s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under houghton mifflin s commercial paper program and its unsecured credit facility 
houghton mifflin does not enter into speculative or leveraged derivative transactions 
houghton mifflin enters into transactions involving financial instruments for purposes of managing its exposure to interest rate risks and funding costs 
through the use of interest rate products such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate locks  houghton mifflin can achieve a predetermined mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   houghton mifflin had two interest rate swaps in place  each with a notional amount of million and terminating on december  houghton mifflin pays the fixed rate on both swaps and and receives a variable rate based upon a commercial paper index 
each interest rate swap agreement is designated with all or a portion of the principal balance and term of a specific debt obligation 
these agreements involve the exchange of amounts based on a variable interest rate for amounts based on a fixed interest rate over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based 
the differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the current period 
the fair market value of the swap agreements and changes in the fair market value as a result of changes in market interest rates are not recognized in the financial statements 
gains and losses on terminations of interest rate swap agreements are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the outstanding designated debt and amortized as an adjustment to interest expense related to the debt over the remaining term of the original contract life of the terminated swap agreement 
in the event of the early extinguishment of a designated debt obligation  any realized or unrealized gain or loss from the swap would be recognized in income coincident with the extinguishment gain or loss 
any swap agreements that are not designated with outstanding debt  or notional amounts or durations of interest rate swap agreements in excess of the principal amounts or maturities of the underlying debt obligations  are recorded as an asset or liability at fair market value  with changes in fair market value recorded in other income or expense the fair market value method 
there were no such agreements at december  houghton mifflin currently holds an investment in inso common stock  which is accounted for in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these equity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair market value based on the quoted market price 
as such  houghton mifflin has exposure to market risk related to the fluctuation of inso s stock price 
at february   the value of houghton mifflin s investment in inso has declined to million 
houghton mifflin expects to mitigate its exposure to changes in inso stock price by using the inso common stock to redeem the sails debt 
if houghton mifflin redeems the sails with the shares of inso common stock  it would record a gain representing the excess of the redemption amount over the book value of houghton mifflin s investment in inso see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
