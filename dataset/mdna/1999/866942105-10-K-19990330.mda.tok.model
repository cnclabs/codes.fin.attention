item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview sun hydraulics corporation is a leading designer and manufacturer of high performance  screw in hydraulic cartridge valves and manifolds which control force  speed and motion as integral components in fluid power systems 
the company sells its products globally through independent distributors 
approximately of product sales are used by the mobile equipment market and are used by the industrial equipment market 
in  the company generated approximately of its net sales outside the united states  and the company s single largest end user customer represented less than of net sales 
demand for the company s products is dependent upon demand for the capital goods into which the company s products are incorporated 
the capital goods industry in general  and the fluid power industry in particular  is subject to economic cycles 
according to the national fluid power association  united states mobile hydraulic shipments were up in  from and industrial hydraulic shipments were up  however  industry orders were down in  compared to north american distributor inventories of sun products increased approximately from december to december during the fourth quarter of  the company improved its product delivery times and significantly reduced its past due backlog 
these improvements  coupled with distributor inventory increases during and the slowdown of business  could adversely affect orders  and thus  shipments  in the near term 
net sales increased in compared to orders for were below during  product delivery times improved and past due backlog was significantly reduced 
this was due to the capacity expansion of the united states manufacturing operation completed during the first half of  a company wide initiative to reduce production lead times  and the fact that demand leveled off 
plans for additional capacity are in process  which the company anticipates will be put place during the high volume cartridge production cell will be moved from the sarasota plant to the new manatee county plant that was completed in an automated assembly machine and additional equipment will be added to the cell and a heat treat operation will be installed by the end of the year 
the sarasota plant will be rearranged to take advantage of the additional space created by the movement of the cell and will manufacture new products and products required in lower volumes 
the expansion of the united kingdom production facility has been postponed until a significant increase in customer demand is foreseen 
the plant in germany is proceeding with the start up of prototype manifold production 
assembly of the company s new electrically actuated product line solenoid is also anticipated to be performed in germany for european customers 
operating profits were adversely affected in due to increases in manufacturing prime costs 
this was a result of continued emphasis on improving customer delivery times and product quality 
material costs were particularly affected by outsourcing and increased costs of purchased parts 
the company has developed a procurement strategy and instituted an ongoing program to source quality parts more cost effectively 
management believes that the initiatives to increase capacity and productivity and decrease prime costs will start to have positive effects on operating profit by the second half of the new series product line sales were less than of total net sales in there was little promotion of this product line due to production capacity constraints and long lead times for existing product lines 
marketing efforts will increase in as confidence is gained that customer delivery requirements can be satisfactorily met 
an electrically actuated cartridge valve solenoid has been designed and is undergoing beta testing at several customer sites 
a multi year contract has been entered into with a supplier to provide the electrical assembly 
production is planned for the second quarter of this year 
this is a new addressable market  which the company believes is larger than the market for non solenoid cartridge valves 
most of the company s competitors offer solenoid cartridge valves as well as non solenoid cartridge valves 
historically  new product line volume builds slowly and initially generates low margins 
margins improve as volume increases and the design and manufacturing processes mature 
during  profit should be positively affected by the series and solenoid cartridge valve shipments  however  the percentage of cost of sales to sales will be adversely affected 
on september   the company purchased korea fluid power  ltd 
kfp  which formerly acted as the company s korean distributor  and had net sales in of approximately million 
in january  the new subsidiary s name was changed to sun hydraulics korea corporation sun korea 
sun korea sells primarily to oems in the korean mobile market and also manufactures aluminum manifolds that incorporate the company s and other manufacturers screw in cartridge valves 
on november   the company entered into a joint venture with its distributor for taiwan to establish a distributorship and manifold manufacturing operation in mainland china 
the company has invested million and has ownership 
a building has been leased in shanghai  and start up of operations is underway 
sales of the joint venture are not expected to be significant in most of the company s screw in cartridge valve competitors produce screw in cartridge valves that fit an industry common cavity that allows their products sometimes to be interchangeable 
the industry common cavity is not supported by any national or global standards organizations 
the international standards organization iso recently developed a standard screw in cartridge cavity that is different from the industry common cavity 
the company does not manufacture a product that fits either the industry common or the iso standard cavity 
currently  the company is not aware of any major competitor that produces a full line of standard products conforming to the iso standard 
the company is aware that several competitors are designing  and some are producing  cartridge valves that are interchangeable with the company s cartridge valves 
the company has long encouraged the hydraulics industry to recognize the benefits of the company s cavity structure  which utilizes its unique cartridge valve designs  and is hopeful that the recent action by competition is an endorsement to that end 
the company believes the adoption by others of the cavity structure utilized by the company will increase its total market opportunities 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in the company s statements of income as a percentage of net sales

international net sales increased  or million  to million in  compared to million in european net sales increased million  or in compared to asian net sales decreased million or in compared to gross profit gross profit decreased slightly to in  compared to in gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit as a percent of sales was due primarily to increased manufacturing prime costs in the united states operation 
material costs increased as a percentage of net sales due to a full year effect of increases incurred primarily in the second half of these increases in related to parts cost increases primarily for engineering design changes and the outsourcing of parts 
direct labor and related direct expenses did not decrease appreciably as a percentage of net sales due to inefficiencies incurred to improve product delivery lead times 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses selling engineering and administrative expenses increased or to million in  compared to million in increases in compensation  travel and meetings were offset by decreases in trade show  catalogue and general business expenses 
the acquisition of sun korea contributed approximately million to selling  engineering and administrative expenses 
these expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in interest expense interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
the interest expense related to long term mortgages and related party debt decreased  however  this was offset by increased interest on the unsecured line of credit 
miscellaneous income expense miscellaneous income was million in compared to million of expense in in  the company received a million payment in settlement of a business interruption insurance claim 
this claim was related to a fire in september  at the manatee county facility while it was under construction  and delayed the opening of operations 
income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was of pretax income compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate from to  was due primarily to the mix of pretax income between the company s operating segments and the resolution of tax audits

with the additional space gained through bringing the new plant in the united states on line in march  worldwide shipments in the last six months of increased over the same period in and increased over the first six months of gross profit gross profit increased  or million  to million in  compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit as a percent of sales was due to a higher fixed cost base associated with the new plants in the united states and germany 
in addition  there were production start up costs in the united states and incremental production costs associated with expediting product shipments to meet the significant increase in customer demand 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses selling  engineering and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million in  compared to million in for the year ended december   these expenses included a non cash  non recurring compensation expense of million related to the termination of phantom stock compensation agreements and the issuance of options to directors 
excluding this expense selling  engineering and administrative expenses increased  or to million compared to million in this increase was due to application software expenses in the united states and the united kingdom and increased fixed administrative expenses in the new manifold plant in the united states 
expenses as a percentage of net sales excluding the non recurring charge in decreased to in from in the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted from allocating these higher expenses over greater net sales 
interest expense interest expense increased million or to million in compared to million in this was due to the use of the unsecured credit line in the united states throughout  which required higher working capital related to increased sales volumes 
miscellaneous income expense miscellaneous income expense decreased million to million in due to interest income related to the temporary investment of cash received from the company s initial public offering  offset by currency exchange losses  primarily in the german operation

liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary source of capital has been cash generated from operations  although short term fluctuations in working capital requirements have been met through borrowings under revolving lines of credit as needed 
the company s principal uses of cash have been to pay operating expenses  make capital expenditures  pay dividends to shareholders and service debt 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
cash flow from operations in was million  compared to million in and million in the increase in the company s cash flow from operations in compared to was due primarily to an increase in net income of million and an increase in depreciation of million 
the decrease in the company s cash flow from operations in compared to was due primarily to increased inventory levels in the plants in the united states and increased accounts receivable related to increased sales volume  offset partially by increases in net income and depreciation 
capital expenditures were million in compared to million in  and million in in  million was spent in the united states operations  million was spent in the united kingdom  and was spent in germany 
in  million was spent to complete the new facilities in the united states and germany and the balance of million for machinery and equipment 
capital expenditures in included million for buildings and land improvements for the united states and german facilities and million for machinery and equipment 
in  the company was awarded a grant of million by the german government  which helped to offset the cost of the german facility 
the grant required that the german operation employ people by june  this deadline has now been extended until september   and if the requirement is not met  of the grant plus interest will have to be repaid 
this amount has been recorded as a deferred grant 
the repayment of the million would only affect cash and would have effect on net income 
the company has three revolving lines of credit one in the united states  one in england  and one in germany 
none of these arrangements contains pre payment penalties 
in february  the company negotiated a one year  unsecured revolving credit facility in the united states 
the new credit facility provided for a maximum availability of million  payable on demand at the lender s prime rate of interest  and contained no debt covenants 
at december   million was outstanding under this credit facility 
in february  the company renegotiated this unsecured credit facility for a term of one year and an interest rate equal to the bank lender s prime rate less  or libor plus for predetermined periods of time at the company s option 
in england  the company has a million line of credit  denominated in british pounds  which bears interest at a floating rate equal to over the bank s base rate and is payable on demand 
at december   there was no balance outstanding on this credit facility 
the german line of credit is denominated in german marks and is payable on demand  with interest payable at the lender s prime rate 
a year mortgage note of million was obtained in may  at a fixed interest rate of for construction of the manatee county facility 
terms on the new mortgage note were interest only on the balance drawn down through the completion of construction and then conversion to a year note with a year amortization schedule 
in march  this mortgage note was renegotiated to an interest rate of 
in march  this mortgage note was renegotiated to an interest rate 
new terms are monthly principal and interest payments with remaining principal due july  in may  the company obtained a mortgage loan of approximately million  denominated in german marks  for the new facility in erkelenz  germany 
the loan has a term of years and bears interest at 
in february  the company secured three loans in germany  a ten year fixed interest rate loan for approximately million  a ten year fixed interest rate loan for approximately million  and a ten year fixed interest rate loan for approximately million 
in addition  the company has million in notes payable to former shareholders  which bear interest at a weighted rate of  with terms expiring in one to four years 
these notes were issued by the company in connection with the repurchase of shares of common stock from former shareholders  and do not allow for prepayment by the company 
on september   the company acquired its distributor in korea for million 
the korean company had approximately million of loans outstanding with interest rates from to 
in december  the company paid million to pay off the higher interest rate loans 
at december   the outstanding balance of these loans was million 
in january  the company received million of proceeds from its initial public offering of  shares of common stock 
net proceeds after expenses were approximately million of which million was distributed to shareholders of record as of december   million was used to repay an equipment note  million was used to repay the mortgage on the sarasota facility  million was paid on the mortgage on the manatee facility  million was paid on the united states revolving line of credit  and the remaining million was used for working capital 
the company received payment of million or million  net of expenses related to a business interruption insurance claim in september the claim was related to a fire in the manatee plant in the united states  which occurred while the plant was under construction 
this fire delayed the opening of the new plant which  in turn  delayed the rearrangement of the cartridge operation and the creation of the cellular production for high volume models 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the million bank line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy the company s operating expenses and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
year readiness disclosure management continues to evaluate the issues associated with the year in an effort to minimize the impact of the millennium date change on its business operations  information technology systems  and production infrastructure 
in general  these issues arise from the fact that many existing computer systems  including hardware  software and embedded technology  only use the last two digits to refer to a year 
accordingly  many of these computer systems will not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  these computer systems could fail or create erroneous results 
the company has established the following four phased approach to address the year issue assessment  testing  renovation and validation 
with regard to its internal operations  the assessment phase consist of i the inventory of all systems  including hardware  software and embedded systems such as the company s cnc equipment in all of company s locations  ii the identification of all critical applications  and iii the collection of all internal source codes 
other than with regard to its embedded systems  this phase is now substantially completed 
the company anticipates full completion  including assessment of its embedded systems  by the end of the second quarter of with regard to its external relationships  the assessment phase includes surveying the company s material suppliers  distributors  and customers to determine the potential exposure to the company if such parties fail to correct their year issues in a timely manner 
the company has now received responses to approximately fifty percent of its third party questionnaires 
the company anticipates the completion of this external assessment by the end of the fourth quarter of the company is currently testing all critical applications for year readiness and anticipates completion of this testing by the second quarter of the company defines year ready to mean that neither the performance nor functionality of any of its critical systems  including both information technology and non information technology systems  will be materially affected by dates prior to  during and after the year while testing continues  the company has entered its renovation phase by commencing the replacement of the computer systems in two of its five locations the united states sarasota facility and the united kingdom operation with enterprise manufacturing systems that  according to representations made by the systems manufacturers  are currently year ready 
the final phase of the company s year readiness plan is a validation phase  during which upgraded systems will be re tested 
the company anticipates all phases of its year readiness plan  including the validation phase  to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of there can  however  be no assurance that these deadlines will be met or precisely when the company will be year ready 
the company has not yet obtained information sufficient to quantify the potential effects of possible internal and external year non compliance so as to determine the likely worst case scenarios or to develop contingency plans to deal with such scenarios 
a significant interruption in the company s business due to a year non compliance issue  however  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  operations  and liquidity 
also  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company relies will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
while the company intends to develop appropriate contingency plans prior to the end of the fourth quarter of  there can be no assurances that the company s contingency plans  once developed  will substantially reduce the risk of year non compliance 
the company estimates that the total costs of its year project will be approximately million  including costs totaling million incurred through december  these expenditures are being funded through operating cash flows 
although there can be no assurances thereof  the estimated costs of the year project are not expected to have a material impact on the company s business  operations or financial condition in future periods 
seasonality the company generally has experienced reduced activity during the fourth quarter of the year  largely as a result of fewer working days due to holiday shutdowns 
as a result  the company s fourth quarter net sales  income from operations and net income typically have been the lowest of any quarter during the year 
this was not true in because of the ramp up in production related to the increased capacity in the united states operations 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy 
while inflation has not had  and the company does not expect that it will have  a material impact upon operating results  there is no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
euro on january   eleven member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their national currencies and the euro  which will ultimately result in the replacement of the currencies of these participating countries with the euro the euro conversion 
the company is currently assessing the potential impact of the euro conversion and has initiated an internal analysis to plan for the conversion and implement remediation measures 
the company s analysis will encompass the costs and consequences of incomplete or untimely resolution of any required systems modifications  various technical and operational challenges and other risks including possible effects on the company s financial position and results of operations 
costs associated with the euro conversion are being expensed by the company during the period in which they are incurred and are not currently anticipated to be material 
the company presently believes that  with remediation measures  any material risks associated with the euro conversion can be mitigated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowed funds  which could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
at december   the company had approximately million in variable rate debt outstanding and  as such  the market risk is immaterial based upon a increase or decrease in interest rates 
the company manages this risk by selecting debt financing at the bank s prime rate less  or the libor rate plus  whichever is the most advantageous
