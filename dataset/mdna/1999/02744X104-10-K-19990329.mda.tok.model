year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company has established a team that has completed an awareness program and assessment project to address the year issue including information technology it and non it systems 
the company has determined that it will be required to upgrade or replace portions of its software so that its computer and phone systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  and that certain non it systems  such as alarms  equipment  and heating and cooling systems may need to be upgraded or replaced 
the company expects to be able to complete all of its planned year remediation by the end of the second quarter of and believes that its systems will then be year compliant 
if such planned remediation cannot be completed prior to the end of  the year issue could cause production interruptions that could have a material impact on the operations of the company

the company considers the failure of a supplier or customer to be year compliant to be the most reasonably likely worst case scenario  since it expects to be year compliant prior to the end of the second quarter of and it has determined it has no material exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for the products it has sold 
the company plans to document its preliminary contingency plan by april and to finalize these plans no later than june  after assessing which third parties are most likely to have an adverse effect on the company 
some material adverse effect could result despite such contingency planning 
the costs of the project and the date by which the company plans to complete the year upgrades are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing third party plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the compatibility of the upgrades and conversions  availability of personnel to correct capability issues and similar uncertainties
