item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of first united corporation and subsidiaries collectively  the corporation including first united bank trust the bank  and oakfirst life insurance corporation 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements which appear elsewhere in this report 
earnings analysis overview the corporation s net earnings for increased to million  or over the million re ported for earnings for the year represent a record level of performance for the corporation  exceeding the previous record of million achieved in return on average assets was   and in   and  respectively 
the return on average shareholders equity for increased to from the reported in the return on average equity was in the earnings per share increased to in from in  compared with in during the first and second quarters of the company engaged the services of alex sheshunoff management services  inc  a highly respected financial consulting group  to facilitate a process improvement program 
based on the recommendations of the alex shesunoff management group  inc  and the vision of the executive management  several positions in the organization were changed  new positions were created  and a few positions were eliminated 
all employees were offered a severance package during the restructuring process  and employees chose to accept this package 
throughout this process first united bank  trust maintained its tradition of no lay offs affecting its employees 
for those employees accepting the voluntary severance package  the board of directors authorized a total of  to be charged against earnings during the first six months of forward looking statements the corporation has made certain forward looking statements with respect to this discussion 
such statements should not be construed as guarantees of future performance 
actual results may differ from forward looking information as a result of any number of unforeseeable factors  which include  but are not limited to  the effect of prevailing economic conditions  the overall direction of government policies  unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment  competitive factors in the marketplace  and business risk associated with credit extensions and trust activities  and other risk factors discussed under the heading risk factors  beginning on page above 
these and other factors could lead to actual results which differ materially from management s statements regarding future performance 
net interest income the primary source of earnings continued to be net interest income the difference between interest income and related fees on earning assets  and the interest expense incurred on deposits and other borrowed funds 
this segment of earnings is affected by changes in interest rates  account balances and the mix of earning assets and interest bearing funding sources 
total interest income for increased over  from million to million  primarily due to growth in earning assets 
total interest expense at million represented an increase of from million in this increase was the result of growth in depository accounts as well as the effect of higher rates being paid 
during  the corporation increased its use of borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
interest on this type of borrowing increased by million to a total of million 
the net effect of these changes was a increase in net interest income to million in from million in this compares to million in the improvement in represents an increase of over s net interest income 
table analyzes the changes in net interest income attributable to volume and rate components 
for analytical purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis 
this adjustment facilitates performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the taxable equivalent net interest margin decreased to in from in  compared with in table compares the components of the net interest margin and the changes occurring between  and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience and the amount of non performing loans 
the corporation utilizes the methodology outlined in banking circular allowance for loan and lease losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  commercial and homogeneous or consumer loans 
each loan pool is analyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appropriate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of potential losses in the current portfolio 
these historical loss amounts are modified by the following qualitative factors  levels of and trends in delinquency and non accruals  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by the gathering of information from internal  regulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations are made for those loans in which the collateral value is less than the outstanding loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
allocations are made for loan commitments using the methodology outlined above 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured or for the sba guaranteed portion of loans 
during  management continued to place emphasis on procedures for credit analysis  problem loan detection  and delinquency follow ups 
as a result of these efforts  the provision for credit losses in in creased to million or of gross loans 
the provision for credit losses was 
million and 
million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross charge offs for the years ended december    and totaled   and 
million  respectively 
table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years 
table presents management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category 
specific allocations in any particular category may be reallocated in the future to reflect current conditions 
accordingly  the entire allowance is considered available to absorb losses in any category 
other operating income the corporation and its subsidiaries continue to seek ways of obtaining additional other operating income 
many of the changes the corporation implemented in are fueling the growth in other operating income 
non interest income for  at million  increased over the million earned in in  the corporation experienced an increase in income from security gains  trust and fiduciary activities  and real estate appraisal services 
the growth in our nontraditional services mentioned above accounted for most of the increase of in non interest income over the million earned in other operating expense non interest expense decreased 
million or from million in to million in as previously mentioned  the decrease can be explained by the one time restructuring costs of 
million in  
million of which were related to severance payments to employees incurred during the first six months of excluding the restructuring charges  other expenses contributing to the increase were costs to increase market awareness through various advertising campaigns  developing an office supply inventory  restructuring of a our data processing network  and expenses incurred in the closing of certain loan campaigns 
while some of these expenses will continue  others represent investments in future efficiencies 
including the 
million in severance payments incurred in  the corporation experienced a decrease of 
million in salary and employee benefits in this decrease is a result of the process improvement program completed in the corporation incurred an increase in of 
million in occupancy expense of premises to million 
occupancy expense of premises was comparable at 
million and million in and  respectively 
expenditures to further increase the role of technology in improving the efficiency of customer service delivery and internal processing activities accounted for much of the increase in equipment expenses 
an expansion in the customer service center also contributed to an increase in equipment related expenses 
it is anticipated that the long run efficiencies gained by projects such as these will be a net benefit to the earnings performance of the corporation 
impact of year company state of readiness this is a year readiness disclosure under the year information and readiness disclosure act of the corporation began its year renovation in to prepare its systems for the century date change 
this situation arose when computer systems and programs were originally designed eliminating the first two digits of the century  thereby saving valuable and costly disk and memory space 
however  as we near the st century  the two digits of in the year could be misinterpreted as instead of 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activity 
following the federal financial institution examination council guidelines  the corporation s year project plan contains these phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and implementation 
a more definitive description of these phases is detailed below awareness phase the definition of the problem as well as its scope is conveyed to management  the board of directors and all staff members to facilitate the appropriate resources and cooperation to complete the project 
a year task force was established with a senior member charged with overall project management 
an overall strategy was established which included vendor management including service bureaus  vendors  and service providers and customer issues 
this phase has been completed 
assessment phase this phase was designed to assess the size and complexity of the issue within the corporation s operating and facility environment 
during this phase  we conducted an inventory of all information technology issues including hardware  software  third party service providers  vendors  and with those we share information 
additionally  we inventoried all non information technology items such as facility systems  heating  air conditioning and ventilation systems  security systems  elevators  and utility companies 
these vendors were then contacted for year compliance status  rated as to the mission critical status to the continued operation of your company s functions  and rated as to their project plan for year compliance 
to assure compliance going forward  policies were established requiring all new systems and or relation ships to be evaluated for year compliance prior to implementation 
a budget was established for with the remainder of the project budget allocated for the final phase of this project included the definition of contingency plans 
this phase has been completed 
renovation phase this phase is the redesign of code  upgrade of hardware and or software  vendor certification  and any additional associated changes 
as the corporation utilizes a service bureau for its core processing processing and maintenance of all customer accounts  the renovation phase is mostly one of vendor monitoring for compliance 
several internal programs were identified as requiring upgrades and those have been scheduled through the first quarter of as we utilize a personal computer platform  an intensive review of our computers confirmed the need for the corporation to accelerate our computer replacement and upgrade schedule 
this phase is scheduled to be completed by march of our systems and service providers have informed us that they have completed renovation activities 
validation phase testing is the most time consuming and costly of the phases established 
not only do all systems need to be tested  but all connections to outside sources and vendors must be tested as well 
understanding the consequences of testing in a production environment  your company took the precaution of establishing a test lab  which closely mirrors our operating environment 
we also hired experts in testing to facilitate our test scripts and monitor our process 
the validation of our service bureau for compliance is being completed via proxy testing 
our staff has the responsibility of reviewing all test scripts  providing feedback  and monitoring results 
this process is scheduled to be completed by march with follow up validation through december  we decided not to implement new systems and or upgrades after september  to allow a full quarter for follow up testing of our internal systems 
implementation phase validated systems will be implemented using normal software and hardware implementation procedures 
this requires all systems to be fully backed up prior to loading the validated software onto year compliant computer systems 
any modifications to certified systems must be tested in the test lab prior to implementation in the production environment 
this phase is scheduled to be completed prior to june beginning october   we will no longer implement new systems or apply upgrades to existing systems to ensure the validity of our operating environment 
third party issues as with any business  the corporation is dependent on third parties for many of our mission critical functions 
we interact with many other entities including  but not limited to  federal reserve bank  credit bureaus  governmental agencies  and our service providers 
additionally  we rely on utility companies for our electric  heating  and telecommunications 
the year readiness of the systems used by these third parties is beyond your company s control 
as part of our assessment  we have reviewed the year plans of our third party relationships and expect all to be compliant prior to december  we are monitoring their progress closely  and have developed contingency plans for services provided by third parties deemed to be mission critical to your company 
customer risk issues as required by our regulator  we have reviewed our customers and market partners for any year consequences 
this includes a review of our loan and deposit customer risk by assessing those customers who have either an aggregate loan balance over  or have a deposit relationship within the top ten percent of our entire deposit base 
additionally  we reviewed those we conduct business with in the investment arena 
we have identified no risk of loss as a result of these reviews as of this time 
on going reviews will be completed during the costs to address the company s year issues costs involved in the year issue include modifying software  hiring year solution providers  testing and validation of all systems  and assuring customer awareness 
the budget allotted for is 
million 
of the total 
million budgeted for year expenses  we have incurred a total of 
million as of december  the risks of the company s year issues the failure to correct a mission critical year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  normal business activities and operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
management currently believes that with modification to existing systems and conversions to new systems  the effects of the year issue will be minimized 
despite the corporation s efforts with respect to third parties  because of the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  there can be no assurance that the systems of other organizations upon which your company s operations rely will be converted in a timely fashion  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with your company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on your company 
contingency planning as a regulated financial entity  we are required to maintain a disaster recovery plan also know as business resumption or contingency plans that details specific guidelines on maintaining our business functions during and after various emergency situations 
year contingency planning is more detailed and has two levels of review 
first  we completed remediation contingency planning  which sets trigger dates for all of our mission critical systems that are not compliant 
should a system or vendor fail to provide year certification or miss significant remediation dates by the trigger date  alternative methods and vendors would be implemented 
the second phase of year contingency planning solidifies and expands our existing business recovery plans to include a number of what if scenarios after the century date change 
meetings wore held to review all mission critical systems and alternative methods described to handle any disruption or miscalculation after the year has arrived 
plans are in place to review our business recovery plans again during l and to simulate instances where these plans would be implemented 
information technology  development the corporation recognizes the need to continue information technology development in addition to the year project plan 
we will continue to research and develop other technology  initiatives as they pertain to the company s overall strategic planning process 
we are currently implementing several information technology projects  however  your company decided to suspend projects from september  until after january  one project was postponed due to an implementation date too close to this time period 
independent verification in order to assure the corporation is making the appropriate progress toward achieving year compliance and to assure our year plan is comprehensive  we have retained the services of an independent third party to conduct a second review of our year efforts 
this review was completed in september and the results were favorable with only a few minor adjustments to our plan implemented as a result 
we will be completing a second review during the second quarter of information about the corporation s year project  other than historical information  should be considered forward looking in nature and subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the costs of the project and the dates on which your company s plans to complete project stages are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the inability to control third party modification plans and similar uncertainties 
applicable income taxes applicable income taxes are detailed in note of the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense amounted to million in l as compared with million in l and million in these amounts represented effective tax rates of   and for   and  respectively 
investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions as part of the asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are carried at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity net of income taxes 
thc corporation does not currently follow a strategy of making security purchases with a view to near term resales and therefore  does not own trading securities 
for additional information  see notes i and to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities statement no 
 was issued 
statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for all quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  as permitted  the corporation early adopted this statement on july  with the exception of the reclassification listed below  the adoption of statement no 
did not have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements as the company does not enter into derivative contracts 
in connection with the adoption of this statement  million of the investment securities previously classified as held to maturity were reclassified to available for sale 
as the securities were marked to market coincident with the reclassification  the change resulted in an increase of 
million  net of tax to other comprehensive income 
total investment securities increased million or in i from million in to million in the corporation reported a decrease of million or during in its us treasury securities from million in to million in total obligations of state and political subdivision investments increased million or in to million as a result of efforts by management to extend the maturity of the portfolio and to obtain a higher yield 
the corporation manages its investment portfolios utilizing policies which seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity  manage interest rate sensitivity risk  meet earnings objectives and provide required collateral support for deposit activities 
excluding the us government sponsored agencies  the corporation had no concentrations of investment securities from any single issues that exceeded of shareholders equity 
table exhibits the distribution  by type  of the investment portfolio for the three years ended december   and respectively 
loan portfolio the corporation  through its bank  is actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in garrett  allegany  washington and frederick counties in maryland  mineral  hardy  berkeley and hampshire counties in west virginia and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
the corporation has policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of the corporation s loan portfolio these policies include underwriting standards for new credits and the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the reserve for loan and lease losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided an effective check and balance for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the level of risk  size of the loan and the experience of the lending officer 
table presents the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio 
it has been the historical policy of the corporation to make the majority of its loan commitments in the market area it serves 
however  with the competitive nature of the banking industry  the corporation is forced to look in nontraditional rnarkets to expand its business 
the corporation had no foreign loans in its portfolio as of december  during  gross loans increased million or to a total of million 
in comparison  gross loans at year end increased million or to a total of million as compared to the balances 
the indirect lending portfolio experienced substantial growth in this portfolio grew from million at december  to million as of december  thc corporation has started to expand its presence in the indirect market by forming a leasing company in late although only a small number of leases were booked as of december   the corporation feels that this product will complement its existing indirect network the corporation also experienced growth of or million in its home equity product 
this product continues to grow due to the tax advantages that it presents 
table details the dollar amount and percentage distribution at the various key categories of credit in the loan portfolio 
funding for loan growth during l and was provided by increased levels of deposits from within our market area as well as borrowings from federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and our upstream correspondent banks 
it is the policy of the corporation to place a loan on non accrual status whenever there is substantial doubt about the ability of a borrower to pay principal or interest on the outstanding credit 
management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
non accrual loans are closely monitored by management 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
at december   the corporation had 
million of non accrual loans 
table details the historical activity of non accural loans 
deposit and other funding deposit liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  or an increase of 
although the million in growth does not compare favorably with the million growth experienced in  the corporation was able to meet its liquidity needs through borrowings from federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb and other correspondent banks 
these borrowings increased from million at december  to million at december  this represents an increase of over the previous year 
the corporation has an approved credit line with fhlb in the amount of million 
the increased competition from other banks  brokerage firms  and other financial outlets has caused the corporation to look to non traditional sources to cost effectively meet its liquidity needs 
capital resources the bank and the corporation itself are subject to risk based capital regulations which were adopted by federal banking regulators and became fully phased in on december  these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy  and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit  the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier capital  consisting of common shareholders equity and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for credit losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier ratio of 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking companies must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guide lines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into account current or anticipated risks and future growth opportunities 
on december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  well above the regulatory minimum of 
the risk based capital ratios for year end and were and  respectively 
total shareholders equity remained stable  increasing slightly from million at year end to million at year end the minimal growth in capital can be explained by the corporation s stock buy back program and increased shareholder dividends 
total shareholders equity at december  was million 
the equity to assets ratio at december  was  compared with and at year end and  respectively 
on july   as part of the corporation s capital plan  the board of directors also authorized the corporation s officers to repurchase up to of its outstanding common stock 
purchases of the corporation s stock under the program were completed in brokered transactions or directly from the corporation s market makers 
on april   the board of directors ratified an amendment to the plan which would enable the corporation s management to repurchase an additional or  shares 
as of december  or shares have been repurchased and retired under the plan authorized by the board of directors 
cash dividends of s

this represents a dividend payout rate dividends per share divided by net income per share of   and for   and  respectively 
asset and liability management introductlon the investment and funds management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to assure that the withdrawal demands of depositors and the legitimate credit needs of the corporation s delineated market areas arc accommodated total liquid assets  represented by cash  investment securities and loans maturing within one year  amounted to million  or of total assets at december  this compares with million  or of l year end assets  and million  or of year end assets 
additional liquidity of l million is available from unused lines of credit at various upstream correspondent banks and the fhlb of atlanta 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in thc prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics bet year assets and liabilities 
management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margin  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the corporation uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to assure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit the corporation during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management of the corporation formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the updated impact on net income over specified periods 
management does not use derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that the corporation was liability sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on pre tax income of changes in interest ratios  management has assumed that any changes would immediately effect earnings 
normally when an organization is liability sensitive there is a positive impact to income when interest rates decline 
the simulation analysis shown below shows a negative impact when interest rates decline or basis points 
management explains this effect due to the current position of interest rates  whereby certain liability accounts are currently priced at a level where management feels they cannot be reduced further in rate  therefore  the full impact of repricing liabilities in the declining rate environment is not realized 
based on the simulation analysis performed at year end the corporation estimates the following changes in income before taxes assuming the indicated interest rate changes december  basis point increase 
million basis point increase 
million basis point decline 
million basis point decline 
million december  basis point increase million basis point increase 
million basis point decline 
million basis point decline 
million this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between prime rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
table presents the corporation s interest rate gap position at december  this is a point in time position which is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of the corporation s position at any other time
