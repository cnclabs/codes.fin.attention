operating expenses  excluding a write off of acquired in process research and development from the wells acquisition  were million  or of net sales  for  compared to million  or of net sales  for this dollar increase in operating expenses reflects the costs associated with the start up of the control systems interconnect division in the third quarter of as well as the costs associated with the advertising campaign to promote the production bga z lok tm product family 
write off of acquired in process research and development 
the non recurring write off of approximately million of acquired in process research and development was recorded in connection with the wells acquisition 
the remaining goodwill and purchased intangibles will be amortized over to years  which will increase operating expenses by approximately million per year 
interest and other income expense  net

provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for was approximately  compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate for resulted primarily from the write off of acquired in process research and development relating to the wells acquisition 
before taking into consideration the write off of acquired in process research and development  the company s effective tax rate was 
incomplete technology update the acquired in process research and development ipr d which was expensed in in connection with the wells acquisition related to in process burn in socket designs and manufacturing process for various next generation high density ic package types 
more specifically  there were six projects for dual sided surface mount so packages  six for chip scale packages csp  three for lan grid array lga  two for ball grid array bga  two for test sockets and one for a miscellaneous package 
of the six so projects  four remain active and two were abandoned in of the six csp projects  three remain active  two were postponed and one was abandoned in of the three lga projects  one remains active and two were abandoned in of the two bga projects  both were abandoned in of the two test socket projects and the one miscellaneous package project  one remains active and two were abandoned in regarding the active projects as a whole  an additional million in capital costs were expended in for the active projects as a whole  net sales of  were generated in failure to successfully develop the ipr d projects would negatively impact the company s future performance and its ability to compete in the burn in socket market 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared to million in these funds were sufficient to meet increased working capital as well as capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company currently anticipates that its capital expenditures for will be approximately million  which consists primarily of purchased tooling and equipment required to support the company s business 
the amount of these anticipated capital expenditures will frequently change based on future changes in business plans and conditions of the company and changes in economic conditions 
in december  the company obtained a senior credit facility for million from fleet national bank and other lenders the senior credit facility to finance in part the wells acquisition 
the senior credit facility is secured by all of the assets of the company 
in conjunction with the senior credit facility  pcd and wells cti formerly wells electronics  inc each entered into a stock pledge agreement with fleet and the other lenders pledging all or substantially all of the stock of the subsidiaries of pcd and wells cti 
each of pcd  wells cti and certain of their subsidiaries also entered into a security agreement and certain other collateral or conditional assignments of assets with fleet and other lenders 
in august  the company renegotiated the senior credit facility 
as a result  the interest rate premium of basis points charged on approximately million of the senior credit facility was eliminated 
according to its terms  the re negotiated senior credit facility will terminate on or before december  at december  and  borrowings of million and million were outstanding under the senior credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of and  respectively 
the agreement governing the senior credit facility contains numerous financial and operating covenants 
among these covenants are restrictions that the company i must maintain john l 
dwight  jr 
as chief executive officer of the company or obtain the consent of the lenders under the senior credit facility to any replacement of mr 
dwight  ii may not  without the prior consent of such lender  acquire the assets of or ownership interest in  or merge with other companies  and iii may not  without the prior consent of such lenders  pay cash dividends 
the senior credit facility also requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  minimum quick ratio  as defined  maximum ratio of total senior debt to ebitda  maximum ratio of total indebtedness for borrowed money to ebitda  minimum interest coverage ratio  maximum capital expenditures  as defined  during the terms of the senior credit facility 
in december  the company entered into a subordinated debenture and warrant purchase agreement purchase agreement with emerson electric co 
emerson  the company s largest stockholder 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  the company issued to emerson a subordinated debenture debenture with a principal amount of million at an annual rate of interest of and a common stock purchase warrant the emerson warrant for the purchase of up to  shares of pcd common stock at a purchase price of per share 
in april of  the company paid the principal  interest and prepayment penalty of  or  in full  resulting in an extraordinary charge to income of  net of taxes  in the second quarter of accordingly   shares of the emerson warrant terminated by the terms thereof  leaving the emerson warrant only exercisable for  shares of pcd common stock 
the emerson warrant expires on december  the company believes its existing working capital and borrowing capacity  coupled with the funds generated from the company s operations  will be sufficient to fund its anticipated working capital  capital expenditure and debt payment requirements through because the company s capital requirements cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on terms satisfactory to the company or not disadvantageous to the company s stockholders 
inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold used in plating  copper and brass used for contacts  and plastic material used in molding connector components 
in the past  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to similarly offset such cost increases in the future 
impact of year the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
if the company s computer programs with date sensitive functions are not year compliant  they may interpret a date using in the year field as the year rather than the year this misinterpretation could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  an interruption of design or manufacturing functions or an inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities until the problem is corrected 
the company has identified its year risk in three categories internal information technology it systems  internal non it systems  including embedded technology such as microcontrollers  and external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
internal it systems 
the company utilizes a significant number of information technology systems across its entire organization  including applications used in manufacturing  product development  financial business systems and various administrative functions 
during and  the company reviewed the year issue that encompassed operating and administrative areas of the company 
the company found that  with the exception of the south bend  indiana location of wells cti wells cti south bend  its information technology systems will be able to manage and manipulate all material data involving the transition from the year to the year without functional or data abnormality and without inaccurate results related to such data 
during the past year  wells cti south bend has completed the modifications and testing of its information technology systems  and the company believes that the wells cti south bend location is now year compliant 
the cost of the modifications and testing at wells cti south bend was approximately  the company does not have a contingency plan in place for year failures of its internal it systems 
if the company has not achieved or does not timely achieve year compliance for its major it systems  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations and business of the company 
independent of the year issue and in order to improve access to business information through common  integrated computing systems across the company  pcd began a worldwide information technology systems replacement project with systems that use programs from oracle corporation 
the company is in the implementation phase for this system and is expected to be complete by december  internal non it systems  including embedded technology 
the company is in the data gathering phase with regard to non it systems including embedded technology such as microcontrollers 
pcd is currently gathering data to assess the impact of the year on its non it systems such as design  manufacturing  testing and security  with year compliance targeted for april  the company does not at this time have sufficient data to estimate the cost of achieving year compliance for its non it systems 
the company does not currently have a contingency plan in place for year failures of its internal non it systems and embedded technology 
if the company is unable to achieve year compliance for its major non it systems  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations and business of the company 
external noncompliance by customers and suppliers 
the company is in the process of identifying and contacting its material suppliers  service providers and contractors to determine the extent of the company s vulnerability to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
pcd expects to complete its assessment of that vulnerability by april  to the extent that responses to year readiness inquiries are unsatisfactory  the company intends to change suppliers  service providers or contractors to those who have demonstrated year readiness  but the company cannot assure that it will be successful in finding such alternative suppliers  service providers and contractors 
the company does not currently have any formal information concerning the year compliance status of its customers but has received indications that most of its customers are working on year compliance 
if any of the company s significant customers and suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  and the company is unable to replace them with new customers or alternative suppliers  the company s financial condition  results of operations and business could be materially adversely affected 
the above discussion of the company s efforts  and management s expectations  relating to year compliance contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities exchange act of see forward looking information 
the company s ability to achieve year compliance  the level of incremental costs associated with compliance and the timing of compliance  could be adversely impacted by  among other things  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  vendors ability to modify proprietary software  and unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance review 
item a 
market risk and security analysis interest rate risk pcd is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates in connection with its variable rate term loan 
in order to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on earnings  pcd entered into an interest rate swap that fixed the interest rate on a notional amount of its variable rate term loan 
see management s discussion and analysis of operations liquidity and capital resources 
under the swap agreement  pcd pays a fixed rate of on a notional amount of  and receives libor 
the potential increase in the fair value of its term loan when adjusting for the interest rate swap paying at a fixed rate would result from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates was not material
