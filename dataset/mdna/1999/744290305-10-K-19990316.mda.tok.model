interest  net 
net interest income decreased  or  to  in from  in the decrease in net interest income is due primarily to interest expense of approximately  in on the debt issued for the acquisition of cms  which was not present in in process research and development technology 
as a result of the acquisitions of cms and hcs  we recorded charges totaling  in related to the expensing of in process research and development technology 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of such charges 
other 
in  we earned  from the sale of certain assets of our drug dispensing operations to eckerd corporation in net loss 
as a result of the foregoing  we recorded a net loss of  in  as compared to a net loss of  in liquidity and capital resources in  cash used in operating activities totaled  this was primarily due to our net loss partially offset by depreciation and amortization charges 
these activities were financed through available cash resources  private placement sales of  shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of  and  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
during this period  we acquired ims for  in cash plus common stock  made  in debt and interest payments for notes payable acquired with ims and key  and made several cash payments related to acquisitions completed in including a debt payment under our obligation to the former owner of cms for  a contingent payment to the former owner of hcs in the amount of  for meeting defined operating criteria in the months subsequent to the acquisition  and  to walgreens under our contract for the purchase of prescribe 
additionally  we incurred approximately  in net costs principally leasehold improvements  relocation expenses and rent deposits for the relocation of our corporate offices and our network and development operations in fort lauderdale in september after these receipts and expenditures  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  as of december  these available funds continue to be used for operations  the further development and marketing of our products and services  equipment and other general corporate purposes 
in addition  we are continuously evaluating acquisition opportunities and other strategic alternatives that add synergies to our product offerings and business strategy 
pursuant to this strategy  we purchased the healthcare edi assets of smmi for  in cash in january we have a revolving bank line of credit of up to  subject to availability of suitable collateral  which was renewed in august borrowings  if any  are due on demand  collateralized by certificates of deposit and us treasury notes  and bear interest at the prime rate less 
there were no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit as of december  as a result of the acquisitions of cms  hcs and prescribe in  we are obligated to make certain payments in the next months 
these payments are as follows  for cms   for hcs  and  for prescribe 
the cms and hcs payments may be made at least in cash and the balance  if any  in common stock 
we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was times in compared to times in this increase is attributable to the additional cash and accounts receivable generated from our recent acquisitions 
accounts receivable turnover for us was times in the period which was comparable to times in inventory turnover times in the period compared to times in the period  this decrease is attributable to slower inventory turnover at key 
we expect to continue to incur negative net cash flow from operations until we begin receiving higher levels of revenues from our healthcare edi and communication devices segment and or from cash generated by our network integration services segment 
management is committed to the strategy of investing funds in further marketing and development of our products and services and may pursue additional acquisitions which are deemed to be in accordance with our business strategy  both of which may require additional equity or debt financing 
however  there can be no assurances that such financing will be available under terms and conditions acceptable to us 
future outlook we continue to grow through strategic acquisitions and concentration on our core healthcare edi and communication devices segment  our strategic relationships and other plans to increase the usage of our healthcare information technology products and services to achieve requisite economies of scale 
we have successfully reduced our operating losses before non cash charges 
such non cash charges are significant and result primarily from amortization expenses related to our acquisitions 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses until we generate sufficient recurring revenues from our products and services to cover the total of our cash and non cash expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will realize an adequate level of recurring revenues from the sale of our products and services  or that revenues from its operations or those of our recently acquired businesses and any future acquisitions will ultimately result in achievement of profitability 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted and are reporting in accordance with sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
there were no differences between our net loss and comprehensive loss under sfas no 
and the adoption of sop no 
did not have a material effect on the timing of our revenue recognition 
year compliance general 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit dates 
such systems may not be able to distinguish th century dates from st century dates 
to address these and any other year operational issues which may affect us  in september we appointed a year committee and hired a year project manager to review our internal computer systems and our products and services as well as review the progress of our principal customers  vendors and resellers 
the committee has developed a priority order list of our products and services and has commenced the year project plan in accordance with this list 
our year project plan consists of four phases assessment  remediation  validation and distribution 
the primary purpose of the assessment phase is to list and analyze the inventory of our products sold and supported 
the major issues encountered during this phase are the identification of language the software is written in  the source code and any third party libraries in a product 
the remediation phase is where changes to the programs and codes are actually made 
the validation phase is where the remediated products are tested and then submitted for independent verification and validation 
the distribution phase  specifically for proprietary products  is where the remediated products are provided to our customers 
products and services 
with respect to our products and services  except those recently acquired from our business combinations with key and smmi  the assessment phase is substantially complete 
the assessment and remediation phases for our three top priority products have been fully completed  with two products currently in the distribution phase 
we expect that all of our software products and our clinical and financial transaction processing networks will be year ready by july based on representations made at time of our merger with key  we believe that key s products and services will operate satisfactorily in a year environment 
we have begun the assessment phase to verify those representations 
based on procedures performed to date  we do not expect any additional actions to be required 
concerning our acquisition of smmi  we have identified three potential year issues 
first  all of smmi s customers require a software upgrade 
we are in the process of replacing their software with our year ready products and expect that this will be completed by may  second  smmi s financial transactions network is being combined with our existing financial transactions network  which is year compliant  by july third  certain financial transaction services currently provided to a certain payer will either be remediated or we will purchase a replacement 
concurrently  we have contacted all third party vendors whose proprietary tools and library products are incorporated into our products in order to determine their respective year readiness status 
certain of those third parties have required actions to be taken by us 
such actions have been performed in accordance with instructions provided by the vendor 
finally  we have contacted our customers to inform them of our year readiness status 
updates to that information are posted on our website when necessary 
our website address is www

internal systems  vendors and suppliers 
we have completed the assessment phase with respect to our internal administrative systems  our vendors and suppliers  and we are in various stages of remediation 
we plan to complete the year compliance for these areas by the end of the third quarter of we also plan to have contacted all of our significant clinical and financial transaction processing partners by the end of the first quarter of in order to assess their year readiness status 
costs 
since the formation of the year committee in september  we have spent  through december  primarily for personnel costs 
the total estimated budget for expenditures directly related to our year effort is approximately  the budget includes staffing costs for employees hired specifically to address year issues  however  it does not include the internal staff costs incurred or to be incurred as these costs are considered part of the normal release structure of our products 
the estimated budget also includes hardware upgrade costs much of which would have been incurred in our normal equipment replacement plans 
as such  anticipated total spending for the year effort is not expected to have a significant impact on our ongoing results of operations 
contingency plan 
while some worst case scenarios are associated with risks outside our control including power and communications  we have started assessing those scenarios within our control 
the year committee identified the major areas of concern to be the handling of data formatting and transmitting compliant data and our customers usage of our software products 
to deal with some of these concerns  we have informed our financial network users of the availability of an algorithm to allow those with non compliant formats to continue transmitting to payers in a year compatible format 
during the second quarter of  we will be formulating documented scenarios for our customer service representatives to assist our hardware and software users if they have year related issues 
we expect that by the fourth quarter we will have a documented business continuity plan to cover all aspects of our customer and internal concerns  including our products and services  alternative vendors suppliers  backup power sources and staffing issues to assure coverage immediately before and after the millennium 
however  due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year issue  there can be no assurance that all year problems will be foreseen and corrected on a timely basis
