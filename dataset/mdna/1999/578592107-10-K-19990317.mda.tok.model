the company s policy is to hedge a portion of its anticipated foreign currency denominated export sales transactions  which are primarily denominated in canadian dollars  for periods not exceeding twelve months

year the much publicized year problem  affecting most companies  arises because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
therefore  these computer programs do not properly recognize a year that begins with instead of the familiar if not corrected  these computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
the global extent of the potential impact of the year problem is not yet known  and if not timely corrected  it could affect the economy and the company 
the company uses computer information systems and manufacturing equipment which may be affected 
it also relies on suppliers and customers who are also dependent on systems and equipment which use date dependent software 
in  the company began its effort for the conversion or replacement of north american computer information systems which did not properly address the year this effort involved both plans for creating replacement systems for those computer information systems which were developed internally as well as obtaining versions of software purchased from third parties which are year ready 
the company estimates that this effort is approximately percent complete as of december  the company essentially has converted or replaced its critical computer information systems for its north american business operations 
the remaining effort primarily relates to the conversion or replacement of blodgett s computer information systems and other non critical computer information systems which the company expects to complete by mid in mid  the company began to review the manufacturing equipment used in the company s north american operations as well as the systems related to the infrastructure of the north american manufacturing and office facilities 
the company is continuing to inventory and verify year readiness of computer controlled manufacturing equipment and computer controls for the north american manufacturing and office facilities 
the company estimates that this effort is approximately percent complete as of december  the company expects to complete the remediation efforts of its production equipment and systems related to its infrastructure for its north american business operations by mid in  the company also began to assess the year problem remediation efforts of third parties in north america who have material relationships with the company including  but not limited to providers of services such as utilities  suppliers of raw materials and customers where there is a significant business relationship 
however  there is no assurance that the company will not be affected by the year problems of other organizations 
rongshida maytag  the company s joint venture in china  is currently reviewing the implications of the year problem on computer information systems and equipment used in the manufacture of its products or facilities 
the remediation effort required for the computer information systems and equipment for rongshida maytag has not yet been identified 
the costs associated with the company s year remediation are being expensed as incurred  are not material to the performance of the company for previous periods and are not expected to be material relative to the future performance of the company 
the company estimates it has spent approximately million to date on the year issue and expects to spend not more than million in total on the year issue 
as previously identified  the company utilizes software which was acquired from third parties 
the company has maintenance agreements with certain of its software vendors which  in return for annual contractual payments  enable it to obtain new software releases  including versions which are year ready 
if the company is unsuccessful  or if the remediation efforts of its key suppliers or customers are unsuccessful with regard to year remediation  there may be a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
if the company s year remediation effort is not successful  the most likely worst case scenario is that the company will be unable to manufacture and distribute its products 
the company is unable to estimate the financial impact of year issues because it cannot predict the magnitude or time length of potential year business interruptions 
the company s contingency plan continues to be under development and includes such precautionary measures as an anticipated increased level of inventory to minimize the potential disruption in the company s ability to manufacture and distribute products 
while the company expects its year issues to be remedied successfully  it cannot guarantee that year issues  including those of third parties  will not have an adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
contingencies the company has contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business  including pending litigation  environmental remediation  taxes and other claims
