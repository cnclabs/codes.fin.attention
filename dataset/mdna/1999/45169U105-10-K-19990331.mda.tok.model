other matters year the year yk problem refers to problems which may occur because some computer systems currently record years in a two digit format 
these computer systems may have difficulty recognizing or processing date information after december  the yk problem may also occur with embedded chips 
the company has been working to evaluate the potential effect of the yk problem on the company s operations 
internal systems the company developed a plan to evaluate its key internal computer systems 
the plan consisted of the following four phases inventory  evaluation assessment of yk risk  remediation and testing 
the company has completed all phases of evaluation for the internal financial and operational systems located at the corporate headquarters of the company 
based upon written documentation and information available on vendor websites  certain testing procedures for business critical hardware and software were developed and implemented by the company 
an independent third party reviewed both vendor information and testing results and conducted other tests to validate work performed 
as a result of this  the company does not believe that the internal computer systems at its corporate headquarters will experience significant yk problems 
the company has also completed the evaluation of the internal financial and operational systems of its other us locations and international operations  excluding certain systems involving operations of companies recently acquired by the company 
the company is currently evaluating the internal financial and operational systems of the companies recently acquired and expects to complete this evaluation by june  cost of year compliance efforts the company does not expect to incur substantial costs with respect to its yk compliance efforts and the company has not deferred other information technology projects as a result of the yk problem 
to date  the company has incurred expenses totaling  and anticipates that its total expenses will not exceed  these figures are primarily reflective of the costs associated with the use of third parties to review and validate work performed and the costs assessing yk problems relating to or arising with respect to third parties 
the cost estimates do not include the cost of internal efforts by company personnel 
the company has not separately accounted for these internal costs 
third party relationships the company has contacted its key vendors regarding their yk compliance efforts 
although the company has received some information from its vendors regarding their yk compliance efforts  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience disruptions in its ability to conduct its business because of yk problems experienced by the company s vendors 
in addition  the company has contacted its key customers regarding their yk compliance efforts 
although the company has received some information from its customers regarding their yk compliance efforts  there can be no assurance that such customers will not experience disruptions in their business which would result in material adverse affects to the company 
one example of a worst case scenario would be a failure in the accounting systems of a significant number of the company s key clients due to the yk problem that resulted in a delay in the payment of invoices issued by the company for services and expenses 
potential liability to third parties the company has participated in yk remediation projects for some of its customers 
although the company has no reason to believe that any such work will result in litigation against the company  it is possible that the company could be materially adversely affected by litigation in connection with the yk remediation services provided by the company 
the company s policy has been to attempt to include provisions in client contracts that  among other things  disclaim implied warranties  limit the duration of express warranties  limit the company s liability to predetermined amounts  and disclaim any liability arising from third party software that is implemented  or installed by the company 
the company also maintains insurance to protect against potential liability in connection with yk remediation services provided by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the desired contractual protections in agreements or that any such contractual provisions will prevent clients from asserting claims against the company with respect to the yk issue 
there also can be no assurance that the contractual protections  if any  obtained by the company or the insurance coverage will operate to protect the company from  or adequately limit the amount of  any liability arising from claims asserted against the company 
contingency plan the company is developing a contingency plan to address various situations which may result if the company experiences yk problems 
the plan will include identification of major systems  dependencies on third parties and resources and strategies necessary to restore operations or work around failures 
it is expected that the contingency plan will be completed by april  and approved by the board of directors on june  there can be no assurance that the contingency plan developed by the company will adequately protect the company from internal yk problems or prevent service interruption or failures experienced by customers and suppliers from having a material adverse effect on the company 
demand for year services many of the company s clients have needed to repair or replace their legacy systems because of yk issues 
the company believes this has favorably impacted the demand for its services and products 
mastech expects that the demand for its related yk problem will diminish significantly over time and will eventually disappear 
the company also believes that as companies focus on yk issues  other less critical projects have not been and may not be initiated or may be suspended 
although the company provides a broad range of information technology services  mastech believes that the reduction in demand for its services that may result from these yk related factors could have an adverse impact on its future performance
