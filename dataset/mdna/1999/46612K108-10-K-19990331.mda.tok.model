item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion incorporates the restatement of certain historical financial data presented in the company s quarterly reports on form q for the periods ended june  and september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
jda is a global provider of integrated enterprise wide software products and services that address the mission critical and valued added management information needs of the entire retail supply chain 
the company s software products include enterprise systems  in store systems  and analytic applications 
jda also offers a wide range of professional services through its consulting and customer support organizations  including project management  system planning  design and implementation  custom modifications  training and support services 
jda has historically derived a significant portion of its revenues from software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services relating to its ibm as based merchandise management system mms 
total revenues from the mms product line represented of the company s total revenues during as compared with in and in although the company expects mms revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues for the foreseeable future  mms revenues as a percentage of total revenues may continue to decline as a result of reduced demand for mms and or increased revenues attributable to the company s other product lines 
software license revenues and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues represented and  respectively  of jda s total revenues during  as compared with and  respectively in and and  respectively  in during  jda s overall revenue mix was affected by lower than anticipated software license revenues 
this decline in software license revenues occurred first in the company s international markets during the second and third quarters of  and then in both international and domestic markets in the fourth quarter of the following table sets forth a quarterly comparison of and domestic and international software license revenues change change quarter ended domestic international domestic vs 
international vs 
the company believes it has experienced and is continuing to experience a decline in overall demand for the company s enterprise systems and in store systems 
in particular  sales of the company s odbms product have failed to meet the company s expectations to date 
the company believes that sales of odbms have been affected by external and internal marketing issues  increased competition and a limited number of referenceable implementations 
the precise nature of the decline in demand for the company s other products cannot be determined 
however  the company believes it may result from a combination of deferred purchasing decisions potentially caused by uncertainty related to the millennium change  elongated sales cycles  ongoing weakness in international economies and increased competition 
the company believes that software license results were also adversely impacted in the second and third quarters by vacancies in senior management positions in europe and latin america 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues are derived from a range of services  including system design and implementation and  to a lesser extent  software maintenance and support and training 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues are generally more predictable but generate significantly lower gross margins than software revenues 
the company has increased the size of its services organization over the past two years in anticipation of an increased mix of consulting  maintenance and other services revenues in both domestic and international markets  and continued market acceptance of its newer client server product lines  which require longer implementation cycles 
in the past  the company has experienced some seasonality in the mix of service revenues in relation to total revenues as a result  the company believes  of retailers preferred implementation timing and the company s expansion  particularly in international markets 
in light of the current uncertainty regarding demand for the company s enterprise and in store systems  and recent declines in software license revenues  the company currently anticipates that consulting  maintenance and other services revenues will increase as a percentage of total revenues 
however  the company expects only modest growth  if any  in the size of its services organization during in europe  where the demand for services has been adversely impacted due to the decline in software revenues  the company has substantially eliminated the subcontractors it was using to supplement its implementation staff 
the company has pursued a strategy of addressing international markets by developing localized versions of its products and establishing international subsidiaries with direct sales and consulting capabilities 
international revenues  which include revenues from international offices and export sales  represented of total revenues in  as compared with in and in consulting  maintenance and other services in support of international software licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to higher costs or generally lower prevailing billing rates in certain of the company s international markets 
therefore  significant growth in the company s international operations may result in declines in gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services 
unstable economic conditions have continued in the asia pacific region during and the receivable balances for the region have shown no significant improvement over further  certain of the macro economic factors affecting the asia pacific region  including significant devaluation of currencies  have begun to appear in the latin american region together with slowing payment trends in the european markets during the second half of  and in particular during the fourth quarter of as past due receivables in these regions increased over the september  balances 
as a result  the company provided a million provision for bad debts during the fourth quarter of the asia pacific  latin american and european regions represented  and  respectively  of the company s revenues during and collectively represented of the company s income from operations during excluding the million one time charge for acquired in process research and development 
although the european region reported income from operations of million for  the asia pacific and latin american regions reported losses from operations of  and million  respectively 
the company remains cautious about its expectations regarding international and domestic operations in the near term  and the company expects its operating results to be less predictable in the future as a result of uncertainties in certain geographic regions and weakness in demand for its software products  possibly related to the millennium change 
management believes these economic conditions and uncertainties could adversely impact the company s business  operating results and financial condition for an indefinite period of time 
the company continues to address the organizational issues that have impacted its execution in europe and latin america during the company filled the vice president latin america position in september and the position of vice president emea in november however  the new vice president emea submitted his resignation effective march  the company has promoted from within its emea organization to fill the vacant position 
the company has also recently completed the realignment of its sales  marketing and new product development personnel along product lines to strengthen its ability to compete during more difficult business conditions 
to the extent the company s international operations expand or represent an increasing percentage of the company s overall business  the company expects that an increasing portion of its international software license and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting the company to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  the company s operations have not been materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and the company has not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  if the company expands its international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
the company may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
there can be no assurance that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding or reducing exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues of the company earned in various countries where the company does business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  thereby adversely affecting the company s earnings 
restatement of quarterly financial statements the company purchased arthur retail on june  in connection with this transaction  the company acquired the rights to the arthur suite 
the arthur suite is a specific application that is being designed to provide full lifecycle decision support for retail clients 
the arthur suite offers a retailer modules for strategic planning  product and channel planning  assortment planning and allocation planning 
as a support activity to each of these processes  a performance analysis function enables a retailer to perform a fact based review of all relevant statistical data 
the development of the arthur suite involves a phased re engineering of existing stand alone modular products and the development of additional functionality and interfaces that will enable the modules to function as a fully integrated business solution 
the company initially allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development ipr d which represented the value of products  including the arthur suite  that were in the development stage and for which technological feasibility had not yet been established 
the initial value allocated to ipr d and written off by the company in connection with the acquisition of arthur retail was calculated using estimates of the costs required to complete the arthur suite  the after tax cash flows attributable to the arthur suite including incremental revenues from enhanced sales of the company s existing products  and the selection of an appropriate rate of return based upon the weighted average cost of capital 
in its september  letter to the american institute of certified public accountants the sec letter  the sec issued guidance on the valuation methodology for acquired ipr d 
the application of the prescribed methodology requires that particular consideration be given to i the specific nature and fair value of the arthur suite  ii the completeness  complexity and uniqueness of the arthur suite at the acquisition date  iii the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the arthur suite and the estimated completion date and iv the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development on schedule  and the consequences if not timely completed 
the company modified the ipr d recorded in the arthur retail acquisition in accordance with the guidance set forth in the sec letter and subsequent communications 
the revised valuation of the ipr d was calculated under a discounted cash flow method using an income approach with a forecast of expected net cash inflows from the development effort 
the forecast incorporated projections prepared by both the company and the former owner of arthur retail 
material net cash inflows were expected to commence in additionally  a percentage of completion was estimated that gave consideration to certain key factors such as the costs invested to date relative to the expected total cost of the development effort  and the amount of progress completed as of the acquisition date relative to the overall technological achievements required to achieve full integration of the arthur suite 
at the date of acquisition  although certain versions of the modules of the arthur suite were commercially available for sale  the bulk of the arthur suite was still in the fundamental systems development stage with a substantial amount of coding  interface development and unit testing still to take place 
the ipr d efforts to complete the development and full integration of the arthur suite were estimated at that time to be complete and the estimated costs to complete the project totaled million 
through december   efforts to complete the arthur suite have been in line with original expectations and the arthur suite has reached a significant level of development 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce a fully integrated arthur suite in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
the change in the methodology resulted in i the exclusion of the incremental revenues resulting from sales of the company s existing products expected from integration with the arthur suite and costs associated with incremental sales and ii an increase in expenses to reflect those that the average buyer without the benefit of synergies would experience 
in addition  the discount rate was increased to to reflect the risk that the average buyer would experience 
as a result  the company s financial statements for the quarters ended june  and september  have been restated to reduce the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d from million to million and record million of additional goodwill and other intangibles on the acquisition of arthur retail 
in addition  the financial statements have been adjusted to reflect changes in the deferred tax asset balances resulting from the revised allocation and to record amortization expense on the additional goodwill and other intangibles 
the change had no impact on net cash flows provided by operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected financial information expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated and certain gross margin data expressed as a percentage of software license or consulting  maintenance and other services revenues  as appropriate year ended december  revenues software licenses consulting  maintenance and other services total revenues cost of revenues software licenses consulting  maintenance and other services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses product development sales and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net income loss gross margin on software licenses gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for were million  an increase of over the million reported in revenues consisted of software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services  which represented and  respectively  of total revenues during  and and  respectively in the decrease in software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues resulted primarily from a decrease in international software license revenues between years 
software licenses 
software license revenues for were million  an increase of over the million reported in domestic software license revenues increased between years due to increased sales of the mms  win dss  retailideas and wcc product lines  and incremental sales of the arthur suite 
international software license revenues decreased from the prior year as a result of the elongation of international sales cycles  deferred purchasing decisions for merchandising systems  weakening international economies and increased competition 
the international results for were also impacted by internal execution issues surrounding the company s strategic realignment of its international sales management group 
this realignment began during the second quarter of and involved the movement of certain key employees from the european and latin american regions to other roles within the company  specifically the positions of senior vice president  international and senior vice president and managing director  jda arthur 
the company did not fill the vacated positions of vice president latin america until september and the vice president emea until mid november however  the new vice president emea submitted his resignation effective march  the company has promoted from within its emea organization to fill the vacant position 
consulting  maintenance and other services 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues for were million  an increase of over the reported in this increase resulted from the higher volume of software license sales  including client server products that require longer implementation cycles  improved utilization  higher average billing rates and the incremental consulting and maintenance revenues related to the arthur suite 
domestic and international consulting  maintenance and other services revenues increased and  respectively between years 
cost of revenues cost of software license revenues was million in as compared to million in cost of software licenses represented and of software license revenues in the respective years

in addition  the company utilized a significant number of subcontractors in europe during to provide timely implementation work 
gross profit gross profit for was million  an increase of over the million reported in gross profit  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased from in to in this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting  maintenance and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues during gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services revenues increased between years  however  from in to in this improvement reflects the favorable impact of increases in the company s maintenance base  both from the arthur retail acquisition and core jda products  and improved utilization and higher average billing rates in the company s consulting practice 
operating expenses product development 
product development costs for were million  an increase of over the million reported in product development costs as a percentage of total revenues increased between years from in to in the company increased its product development staff by between years and as of december   there were over employees involved in the product development function

consulting  maintenance and other services 
consulting  maintenance and other services revenues for were million  an increase of over the million reported in this increase results from increased software license sales and the introduction of client server products that require longer installation cycles 
although domestic consulting  maintenance and other services revenues increased between the comparable years  nearly two thirds of this revenue growth occurred in the company s international markets where the comparative increase was

gross profit gross profit for was million  an increase of over the million reported in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in to in this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting  maintenance and other services revenues as a percentage of total revenues in in addition  the company s gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services revenues decreased from in to in as a result of the rapid expansion of the consulting infrastructure  including high front end recruiting  training and downtime costs associated with the hiring of consultants during consulting  maintenance and other services margins were also reduced by the higher costs associated with the company s use of up to outside contractors in the united kingdom during the second half of to service the increased demand for installation work in that market 
the company s objective is to improve its consulting  maintenance and other services margins during by gradually replacing these contractors with full time staff and improving utilization rates and economies of scale  particularly with respect to the installation of the odbms client server product

provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was for both and this rate reflects statutory federal  state and foreign tax rates  partially offset by a reduction for research and development expense tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  the company has financed its operations primarily through cash generated from operations and public sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  borrowings under its bank line of credit 
the company had working capital of million at december  compared with million at december  cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  an increase of million from the million reported at december  the company also had million in marketable securities at december  operating activities provided cash of million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively

the company had net accounts receivable of million at december   which excluding the impact of receivables for which the related revenue has been deferred  represented days of sales outstanding dsos compared to days at december  dsos may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to a number of factors including seasonality  shifts in customer buying patterns  contractual payment terms  the underlying mix of products and services  and the geographic concentration of revenues

the line of credit matures on july  there were no amounts outstanding on the line of credit at december  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  available borrowings under the bank line of credit and funds generated from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet the company s normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance throughout  the company designated a project team to assess the year compliance of its software products 
based on the company s assessment to date  the company believes the current versions of its software products are year compliant  that is  they are capable of adequately distinguishing st century dates from th century dates 
however  the company is aware that some of its customers are running earlier versions of the company s software products that are not year compliant 
the company has contacted and encouraged such customers to migrate to current product versions 
moreover  the company s products are generally integrated into enterprise systems involving complicated software products developed by other vendors 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that the company may in the future be subject to claims based on year problems in others products  custom modifications made by third parties to the company s products  or issues arising from the integration of multiple products within an overall system 
although the company has not been a party to any litigation or arbitration proceeding to date involving its products or services and related to year compliance issues  there can be no assurance that the company will not in the future be required to defend its products or services in such proceedings  or to negotiate resolutions of claims based upon year issues 
the costs of defending and resolving year related disputes  and any liability of the company for year related damages  including consequential damages  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company faces risk to the extent that suppliers of products  services and systems purchased by the company and others with whom the company transacts business on a worldwide basis do not comply with year requirements 
in the event any such third parties cannot provide the company with products  services or systems that meet the year requirements on a timely basis  or in the event year issues prevent such third parties from timely delivery of products or services required by the company  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the company s plan for the year has included compliance verification of financial institutions  investment advisors  independent payroll service providers  external vendors supplying software and information systems to the company and communication with significant suppliers to determine the readiness of third parties remediation of their own year issues 
as part of its year contingency plan  the company maintains its cash and marketable securities with multiple financial institutions and investment advisors 
the company is also subject to risk that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources and reduce available funds to correct or patch their current software systems for year compliance 
as a result  no assurance can be given that year problems within the company s existing or prospective customer base of retail organizations will not result in the deferral or cancellation of such organizations decisions to license and implement information systems such as those offered by the company 
to the extent year issues cause significant delays in  or cancellation of  decisions to purchase the company s products or services  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
the company recognizes the need to ensure its internal operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures  and has established a project team to assess year risks regarding the ability of the company s internal systems to operate after december  the project team has identified and implemented changes to the company s computer hardware and software applications to ensure availability and integrity of the company s financial systems and the reliability of its operational systems 
the company converted its existing legacy accounting software to a year compliant version in december this conversion was performed entirely by the company s internal is staff and the costs of modifying this software have been expensed as incurred 
during september  the company selected a new time and billing system from an independent third party distributor 
this system will replace an existing legacy system  which is not year compliant  and will be used to accumulate and track billable hours incurred by the company s consulting and customer support staff 
the current project plan calls for this system to be fully implemented by september  however  as part of its contingency plan  the company is modifying its existing legacy system to be year compliant in order to provide a safeguard against any potential movement in the implementation time frame of the new system 
the conversion of the existing time and billing system is expected to be completed by april the company has incurred approximately  to date on year compliance activities and expects to incur no more than  to complete its year compliance activities 
these costs and the timing in which the company plans to complete its year modification and testing procedures are based on management s best estimates 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will timely identify and remediate all significant year problems  or that any such remedial efforts will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
euro currency the participating member countries of the european union agreed to adopt the euro as the common legal currency beginning january  on that same date they established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
the euro will be implemented in phases over a transition period that extends through december  although the company s products currently comply with the requirements of the initial phase in of the euro  they are not fully euro compliant 
the company has defined euro compliant to mean that its products are capable of processing and reporting any data denominated in the euro in the same manner as processing and reporting data denominated in the national currency units that comprise the currencies of those member states that adopt the euro the ncus without any loss of functionality or interoperability or degradation in performance of volume capacity and  without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing  has the ability to provide all the following functions conversion of ncus to euro and vice versa at the fixed conversion rates and conversion of ncus to ncus using the fixed conversion rates between the relevant ncus and the euro and  in each case  rounding of such amounts in accordance with applicable laws and regulations from time to time 
rounding of amounts denominated in euro to the nearest euro cent and of amounts denominated in ncus to the nearest sub unit applicable to the relevant ncus and use in data of the euro symbol 
making and receiving payment of amounts denominated in euro and in different denominations of the euro and or in ncus 
all functions and reporting  including regulatory reporting  in both euro and ncus 
the company is incorporating all required euro compliant functionality into the next version of each of its products that are scheduled for commercial release at various times during to the extent the development and release of fully euro compliant versions does not occur in a timely manner  the company could experience significant delays in  or cancellation of  decisions to purchase its products or services  and as a result  the company s business  operating results and financial condition would be materially adversely impacted 
certain risks our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our quarterly operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future 
many factors may cause these fluctuations  including demand for our products and services  the size and timing of individual orders  particularly with respect to our larger customers  the lengthening of our sales cycle  competitive pricing pressures  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  changes in the mix of software license revenues  changes in the mix of software license revenues compared to consulting  maintenance and other services revenues  the timing of introductions and enhancements of our products or those of our competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in platforms supporting our products  changes in our operating expenses  changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues  our ability to complete fixed price consulting contracts within budget  employee hiring and retention  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  expansion of international operations  changes in our strategies  and general industry and economic conditions 
in addition  we believe we have experienced and are continuing to experience a decline in overall demand for our enterprise systems and in store systems 
in particular  sales of our odbms product have failed to meet our expectations to date 
we believe that sales of odbms have been negatively impacted by external and internal marketing issues  increased competition and a limited number of referenceable implementations 
we have not been able to determine the exact cause of the decline in demand for our other products  but we believe that it may result from deferred purchasing decisions 
these deferred purchasing decisions may stem from uncertainty related to the millenium change  longer sales cycles  continued weakness in global economies and increased competition 
we believe that the prevailing business reasons for purchasing merchandising systems and the other software products offered by the company still exist 
however  you should not rely on historic growth rates for our enterprise systems and in store systems as an indication of their future performance 
because the gross margin on software licenses is significantly greater than the gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services  our combined gross margin has fluctuated from quarter to quarter  and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate significantly based on revenue mix and seasonality 
we typically ship our software products when contracts are signed 
consequently  our software license backlog at the beginning of any quarter has represented only a small portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
as a result  software license revenues in any quarter depend in large part upon contracts signed and the related shipment of software in that quarter 
it is therefore difficult for us to predict revenues 
because of the timing of our sales  we typically recognize a substantial amount of our revenues in the last weeks or days of the quarter  and we generally derive a significant portion of our quarterly software license revenues from a small number of relatively large sales 
it is difficult to forecast the timing of large individual sales with certainty 
accordingly  large individual sales have sometimes occurred in quarters subsequent to when we anticipated 
we expect that the foregoing trends will continue 
if we receive any significant cancellation or deferral of customer orders  or we are unable to conclude license negotiations by the end of a fiscal quarter  our operating results may be lower than anticipated 
in addition  weakening international economies may make it more difficult for us to predict quarterly results in the future  and could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition for an indefinite period of time 
our expense levels are based on our expectations of future revenues 
since software license sales are typically accompanied by a significant amount of consulting  implementation and support services  our consulting and support resources must be managed to meet our anticipated software license revenues 
as a result  we hire and train service personnel and incur research and development costs in advance of anticipated software license revenues 
if such revenues fall short of our expectations  or if we are unable to fully utilize our service personnel  our operating results are likely to decline because a significant portion of our expenses cannot be quickly reduced to respond to any unexpected revenue shortfall 
based on all of the foregoing  we believe that future revenues  expenses and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
furthermore  it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if that happens  or if adverse conditions prevail  or are perceived to prevail  with respect to our business or generally  the price of our common stock may decline 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the retail industry 
we have derived substantially all of our revenues to date from the license of software products and the performance of related services to the retail industry 
our future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to the retail industry 
the success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  we believe that the license of our software products generally involves a large capital expenditure  which is often accompanied by large scale hardware purchases or commitments 
as a result  demand for our products and services could decline in the event of instability or downturns in the retail industry 
such downturns may cause customers to exit the industry or delay  cancel or reduce any planned expenditure for information management systems and software products 
we believe that the retail industry is consolidating 
such consolidation has in the past and may in the future reduce the demand for our products 
any resulting decline in demand for our products and services would negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to manage our growth 
our business has grown rapidly in recent years  with revenues increasing from million in  to million in and to million in our recent expansion has resulted in substantial growth in our number of employees  the scope of our operating systems and the geographic distribution of our operations and customers 
this rapid growth has placed  and if it continues  will continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
for example  we believe that management realignments in connection with our international operations and the acquisition of arthur retail in june may have reduced the effectiveness of our sales efforts in europe and latin america during our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis  to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force  in particular our direct sales force and consulting services organization  and to deal effectively with third party systems integrators and consultants 
we filled the vice president latin american position in september and the vice president emea position in mid november however  the new vice president emea submitted his resignation effective march  the company has promoted from within its emea organization to fill the vacant position 
we anticipate making other changes to the sales organizations in these regions 
in addition  we have recently filled other senior management positions including senior vice president  client services  senior vice president  technology  and senior vice president  marketing 
all members of our executive management team have served in their current positions for less than two years 
our future growth and success depends in large part upon the ability of our executive management team to effectively manage expansion of our operations 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to manage our recent or any future growth  and any failure to do so would negatively effect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  if we continue to grow  we will have to recruit and hire a substantial number of other new employees  including consulting and product development personnel  both domestically and abroad 
our ability to undertake new projects and increase revenues is substantially dependent on the availability of consulting personnel to assist in the design  planning and implementation of our products and services 
consequently  we will not be able to continue to grow in our business at historical rates without adding significant numbers of trained consulting personnel 
moreover  if unable to adequately increase our consulting capacity  we may have to forego licensing opportunities or become more dependent on systems integrators and professional consulting firms to provide implementation services for our products 
due to the present uncertainty surrounding demand for our enterprise and in store systems and recent declines in our software license revenues  we expect that consulting  maintenance and other services revenues will increase as a percentage of total revenues 
however  we expect only modest growth  if any  in the size of our services organization during if revenues fail to meet expectations following the hiring and training of new personnel  our operating results will decline 
due to the addition of significant numbers of new personnel  we have from time to time incurred significant start up expenses  including leasing of office space and equipment  initial training costs and low utilization rates of new personnel 
such start up expenses have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to significant reductions in gross margin on consulting  maintenance and other services revenues and on overall gross margin 
we cannot guarantee that start up expenses incurred in connection with the hiring of additional technical personnel will not reduce future operating results 
ability to attract and retain technical personnel is important to our growth 
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate skilled technical and managerial personnel  especially highly skilled engineers involved in ongoing product development  and consulting personnel who assist in the design  planning and implementation of our products and services 
in particular  our ability to install  maintain and enhance our products is substantially dependent upon our ability to locate  hire  train and retain qualified software engineers 
the market for such individuals is intensely competitive  particularly in international markets 
in this regard  we dramatically increased the number of consulting personnel during and in connection with the continuing development and roll out of our client server products  and to support further development and implementation of mms 
given the critical roles of our product development and consulting staffs  our inability to recruit successfully or the loss of our product development or consulting staffs would hurt us 
the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our current personnel  or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
our inability to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would hurt our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have only deployed our new software products on a limited basis 
our newer software products  odbms  win dss  retail ideas  wcc  and the arthur suite  which are designed for open  client server environments  have all been commercially released within the last three years 
to date  only a limited number of customers have licensed or implemented them 
the market for these products is new and evolving  and we believe that retailers may be more cautious than other businesses in adopting client server technologies 
consequently  we cannot predict the growth rate  if any  and size of the market for our client server products or that this market will continue to develop 
potential and existing customers may find it difficult  or be unable  to successfully implement our client server products  or may not purchase our products for a variety of reasons  including their inability to obtain hardware  software  networking infrastructure  or sufficient internal staff required to implement  operate and maintain an open  client server solution  the generally longer time periods and greater cost required to implement such products as compared to ibm as based products  and limited implementation experience with such products or third party implementation providers 
in addition  we must overcome significant obstacles to successfully market our client server products  including limited experience of our sales and consulting personnel in the client server market and a limited market size 
sales of our odbms product have failed to meet our expectations to date 
we believe that sales of odbms have been affected by external and internal marketing issues  increased competition  and a limited number of referenceable implementations 
if the market for our client server products fails to develop  develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  or if our products are not accepted in the marketplace  our business  operating results and financial condition will decline 
our products are concentrated in one area 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenues from software licenses and consulting  maintenance and other services related to mms 
mms revenues are partially dependent on the continued vitality in and support by ibm of its as platform 
although we expect mms revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues for the foreseeable future  mms revenues as a percentage of total revenues may continue to decline as a result of the increased revenues attributable to our newer software products  particularly odbms  win dss  retail ideas  wcc  and the arthur suite 
the lifecycle of the mms product line is difficult to estimate due largely to the potential effect of new products  applications and product enhancements  including our own changes in the retail industry and future competition 
any decline in mms revenues  as a result of competition  technological change  a decline in the market for or support of the ibm as platform  or other factors  which are not offset by increases in revenues from other products  will cause our business  operating results and financial condition to decline 
we cannot guarantee that prospective purchasers of our ibm as based products will respond favorably to our future or enhanced software products or that we will continue to be successful in selling our software products or services in the ibm as market 
there are many risks associated with international operations 
our international revenues  which include revenues from international subsidiaries and export sales  represented of total revenues in as compared with and of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
although  we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future  we remain cautious about our expectations regarding international operations in the near term 
if our international operations grow  we must recruit and hire a number of new consulting  sales and marketing and support personnel in the countries we have or will establish offices 
we have limited experience in developing localized versions of our products and in marketing and distributing our products internationally 
international introductions of the company s products often require a significant investment in advance of anticipated future revenues 
the opening of our new offices typically results in initial recruiting and training expenses and reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new market 
we cannot guarantee that the countries in which we operate will have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel from which to hire  or that we will be successful at hiring  training or retaining such personnel 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our international operations in a timely manner which could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
our international business operations are subject to risks associated with international activities  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  potentially negative tax consequences  difficulties in staffing and managing geographically disparate operations  greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  licensing and other trade restrictions  currency fluctuations  repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and general economic conditions in international markets 
in addition  consulting  maintenance and other services in support of international software licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to generally lower billing rates and or higher costs in certain of our international markets 
accordingly  any significant growth in our international operations may result in further declines in gross margins on consulting  maintenance and other services 
we expect that an increasing portion of our international software license and consulting  maintenance and other services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting us fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as we continue to expand our international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
we cannot guarantee that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues earned in various countries where we do business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which would reduce our earnings 
unstable economic conditions have continued in the asia pacific region during and the receivable balances for the region have shown no significant improvement over further  certain of the macro economic factors affecting the asia pacific region  including significant devaluation of currencies  have begun to appear in the latin american region together with slowing payment trends in the european markets during the second half of  and in particular during the fourth quarter of as past due receivables in these regions increased over the september  balances 
as a result  we provided a million provision for bad debts during the fourth quarter of the asia pacific  latin american and european regions represented  and  respectively  of our revenues during and collectively represented of our income from operations during excluding the million one time charge for acquired in process research and development 
although the european region reported income from operations of million for  the asia pacific and latin american regions reported losses from operations of  and million  respectively 
to the extent any of these regions grows in importance to us  or retailers in other geographic locations are affected  our business  operating results and financial condition would decline 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for retail information systems are highly competitive 
we believe the principal competitive factors in such markets are product quality  reliability  performance and price  vendor and product reputation  retail industry expertise  financial stability  features and functions  ease of use and quality of support 
a number of companies offer competitive products addressing certain of our target markets 
in the enterprise systems market  for example  we compete with internally developed systems and with third party developers such as gers retail systems  island pacific  radius plc  retek a subsidiary of hnc software  inc  richter management services  sap ag  and sts systems 
our wcc product competes with warehouse and logistic systems from catalyst international  inc  exe and mchugh freeman 
in addition  new market entrants may offer fully integrated merchandising level systems targeting the retail industry 
in the in store systems market  which is more fragmented than the enterprise systems market  we compete with major hardware equipment manufacturers such as icl  ncr and ibm  as well as software companies such as crs business computers  datavantage  inc  sts systems  and trimax 
in the analytic application markets  the arthur suite competes with products from sts systems and mitech computer systems  inc  and ibm s makaro product line 
the retail ideas product competes with products from vendors such as microstrategy and intrepid 
in the market for consulting services  we are pursuing a strategy of forming informal working relationships with leading retail systems integrators such as andersen consulting and pricewaterhousecoopers 
these integrators  as well as independent consulting firms such as ibm s global services division  also represent potential competition to our consulting services group 
some of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over us 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there are risks associated with our strategic relationships 
we have from time to time established formal and informal relationships with other companies  including baan  ibm  microsoft and silvon  inc  to collaborate in areas such as product development  marketing and distribution 
the maintenance of these relationships and the development of other similar relationships is a meaningful part of our business strategy 
currently  our relationships with ibm and microsoft are cooperative  and there is no written agreement defining the parties obligations 
we cannot assure you that our current informal relationships with ibm  microsoft or other companies will be beneficial to us  that such relationships can be maintained  or that we will be able to enter into successful new strategic relationships in the future 
implementation of our products is a lengthy process  our fixed price service contracts may result in losses 
our software products are complex and perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the enterprise 
consequently  implementation of our software is a complex  lengthy process and commitment of resources by our customers is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control 
we believe that the complicated nature and increased flexibility of the client server versions of our products may contribute to the length of the implementation process 
delays in the implementations of any of our software products  whether by us or our business partners  may result in customer dissatisfaction or damage to our reputation and a decline in our business  operating results and financial condition 
we offer a combination of software products  implementation and support services to our customers 
typically  we enter into service agreements with our customers that provide for consulting and implementation services on a time and expenses basis 
certain customers have asked for  and we have from time to time entered into  fixed price service contracts 
these contracts specify certain milestones to be met regardless of our actual costs incurred in fulfilling our obligations 
we believe that fixed price service contracts may increasingly be offered by our competitors to differentiate their product and service offerings 
as a result  we may enter into more fixed price contracts in the future 
we cannot guarantee we can successfully complete these contracts on budget  and our inability to do so could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive 
the computer software industry is subject to rapid technological change  changing customer requirements  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  our position in our existing markets  or other markets that we may enter  could be eroded rapidly by technological advancements not adopted by us 
the lifecycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
the products must keep pace with technological developments  conform to evolving industry standards and address increasingly sophisticated customer needs 
we believe that we must continue to respond quickly to users needs for broad functionality and multi platform support and to advances in hardware and operating systems 
introduction of new products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
we may experience future difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products  or that new products and product enhancements will meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  our business  operating results and financial condition will be hurt 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary technology  including our software source code 
to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and copyright laws  which may afford only limited protection 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we have no patents or patent applications pending 
the source code for our proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work 
although we rely on the limited protection afforded by such intellectual property laws  we also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable maintenance are also essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  and generally control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
the terms of our license agreements with our customers often require us to provide the customer with a listing of the product source code 
although the license agreements place restrictions on the use by the customer of our source code and do not permit the re sale  sublicense or other transfer of such source code  we cannot assure you that unauthorized use of our technology will not occur 
despite the measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer or copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could hurt our business  operating results and financial condition 
our products use technology licensed from third parties  generally on a non exclusive basis 
these licenses generally require us to pay royalties and fulfill confidentiality obligations 
we believe that alternative resources exist for each of the material components of technology licensed from third parties 
however  the termination of any such licenses  or the failure of the third party licensors to adequately maintain or update their products  could result in delays in our ability to sell our products while seeking substitute technology 
any required replacement licenses could prove costly 
also  any such delay  which becomes extended or occurs at or near the end of a fiscal quarter  could result in a decline in our operating results 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain other licenses relating to one or more of our products or relating to current or future technologies  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in the future  we may receive notices claiming that we are infringing the proprietary rights of third parties  we cannot guarantee that we will not become the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties with respect to current or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
any such claim could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or force us to enter into royalty or license agreements rather than dispute the merits of such claims 
moreover  an adverse outcome in litigation or similar adversarial proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require the expenditure of significant resources to develop non infringing technology  require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require us to cease the marketing or use of certain products  any of which could hurt our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we desire or are required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others  such licenses may be made available on terms unacceptable to us  if at all 
as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we believe that software developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
any such claims against us  with or without merit as well as claims we initiate against third parties  could be time consuming and expensive to defend  prosecute or resolve 
there are risks related to product defects  product liability  and integration difficulties 
our software products are highly complex and sophisticated 
as a result  they may occasionally contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
in addition  implementation of our products may involve customer specific customization  and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties 
in particular  it is common for complex software programs  such as our newer  client server software products  to contain undetected errors when first released 
they are discovered only after the product has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of applications and environments 
despite extensive testing  we have in the past discovered defects or errors in our products or custom modifications only after our systems have been used by many customers 
in addition  our customers may occasionally experience difficulties integrating our products with other hardware or software in the customer s environment that are unrelated to defects in our products 
such defects  errors or difficulties may cause future delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications or impair customer satisfaction with our products 
our future business growth depends largely on the continued development and market acceptance of our newer  client server products 
if customers experience significant problems with implementation of those products or are otherwise dissatisfied with their functionality or performance or if they fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition would be negatively impacted 
our products may be used by our customers to perform mission critical functions 
consequently  design defects  software errors  misuse of our products  incorrect data from external sources or other potential problems arising from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
prior to  we did not maintain product liability insurance 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims as well as any liabilities arising from such claims 
however  such provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims and the associated liability and costs 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our performance depends in large part on the continued performance of our executive officers and other key employees  particularly the performance and services of james d 
armstrong and frederick m 
pakis  our co chief executive officers 
we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of messrs 
armstrong or pakis or other key executive officers or employees could negatively affect our financial performance 
our stock price has been highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has experienced large fluctuations that may continue 
future announcements concerning us or our competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  accounts receivable balances or aging  announcements of technological innovations  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  proprietary rights or other litigation  changes in earnings or other estimates  or recommendations by analysts or other factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  stock prices for many technology companies have fluctuated widely for reasons unrelated to the operating results of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  market and political conditions such as recessions or military conflicts  depress the market price of our common stock 
there are risks associated with acquisitions 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies  including those which are significant in size and scope 
acquisitions  such as the acquisition of arthur retail during  involve a number of special risks 
those risks include diversion of management s attention to assimilate the operations and personnel of acquired businesses and the integration of the acquired businesses products and technologies into our own 
whether we achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend  in part  upon whether integration of the acquired business  products or technology is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically disparate organizations  the complexity of the technologies being integrated  and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
the inability of management to successfully integrate any acquisition which we may pursue  and any related diversion of management s attention  may negatively affect our financial performance 
moreover  we cannot guarantee that any products acquired will gain acceptance in our markets  or that we will obtain the anticipated or desired benefits of such acquisitions 
any acquisition which we pursue or consummate could result in a potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization of goodwill and other intangibles  purchased research and development expense  other acquisition related expenses and the loss of key employees  any of which could negatively affect our financial performance
