the forward looking statements contained herein are subject to certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to  those discussed below under certain factors that may affect future results and in item of this form k 
overview tcsi corporation tcsi or the company provides integrated software products and services for the global telecommunications telecom industry 
since its inception in  a significant portion of the company s revenues has been earned from telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers 
since its inception in  a significant portion of the company s revenues has been earned from telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers 
prior to  the company also earned revenues from licensing embedded software contained in wireless products and from the development of system solutions for customers in the insurance  health care  and transportation industries 
during the second half of  the company divested its non telecom product lines by licensing its embedded software product lines and terminating its final transportation related development agreement 
as a result  since  the company has focused almost entirely on offering software solutions to the telecom industry 
the company provides services to customers under level of effort and fixed price contracts 
service revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of contract costs incurred in relation to total estimated contract costs 
changes to total estimated contract costs  if any  are recognized in the period such changes are determined 
the scope and size of many of the company s system solutions are large and complex  typically requiring delivery over several quarters 
from time to time  customers have established payment milestones  which can be achieved only after completion of the related services 
additionally  a portion of the company s revenues has been  and is expected to continue to be  derived from software licensing fees from a limited number of customers 
the company recognizes revenues under time and material type contracts as the services are performed 
for fixed price contracts  the company recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion method 
additionally  the company licenses software to customers under contracts which do not require significant production  modification  or customization of software 
the company recognizes revenues under these contracts when a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
the licensing and implementation of the company s software products generally involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
as a result  the company s sales process is subject to delays associated with lengthy customer approval processes typically accompanying such significant capital expenditures 
accordingly  the company is substantially dependent on its customers decisions as to the timing and level of expenditures and resource commitments 
the variability in the timing of such expenditures could cause material fluctuations in the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
in this regard  the consistency of the company s and quarterly results have been adversely affected by delays in the purchase of software licenses and related services 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from the sale of the company s software products and services to major telecom service providers and equipment manufacturers 
due to the complex nature of the advanced operations support systems oss software being developed  deployment of these systems can contain significant technological risks 
the company has in the past relied  and will in the future rely  on its development and implementation expertise 
additionally  development and implementation of these systems often occurs over several quarters 
there exists the risk that a change in a customer s technology or business strategy during such lengthy development and implementation periods may cause early termination of a project or discontinuance of future phases 
in this regard  the company  in limited cases  has experienced  and may continue to experience  fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results due to termination  cancellation  or non renewal of agreements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management believes that continued revenue growth is highly dependent upon the development and enhancement of software products that meet market needs 
prior to  the company s product development was primarily funded by customers as part of the development of software applications for such customers 
the company typically retained certain rights to developed software products 
in certain circumstances  however  the company agreed to restrict its use of such products to certain markets and during certain time periods 
during  the company began funding a larger portion of its product development costs 
although management intends to target product development spending at levels consistent with other software companies  from time to time  spending may be greater or less than these amounts  as circumstances dictate 
furthermore  management expects that it may periodically acquire businesses  products  or technologies to enhance the company s current product offerings 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected income statement data as a percentage of revenues for each of the years ended december percentage of total revenues revenues services software licensing fees equipment  non telecom total revenues costs  expenses  and special items services equipment  non telecom product development selling  general  and administrative write off of in process technology acquired nonrecurring special items  net loss from operations other income and expense income loss before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit net income loss revenues the company generates revenues from the sale of its software products and related services to the telecom industry

additionally  included equipment revenues representing of total revenues 
software licensing fees increased to million in  which reflects the company s progress in transitioning from a custom software services provider to a software product developer 
for the years ended december  the revenue breakdown is as follows management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in thousands total revenues services    software licensing fees    equipment  non telecom  totals    in thousands telecom revenues services    software licensing fees    totals    total revenues increased in to million from million in the increase in revenues for was primarily attributable to a increase in software licensing fees to million 
license revenues primarily improved as a result of completing several major projects in the united states that were delayed in and the company s focus on transitioning from being a custom software services provider to becoming a software product developer 
the decrease in revenues for versus was attributable to the deployment phase of a significant agreement that the company entered into during with a non telecom customer 
in connection with this agreement  the company purchased equipment on behalf of the customer 
excluding the equipment purchase  total telecom revenues decreased to million in from million in the company expects software licensing fees to continue to vary on a quarterly and annual basis 
total revenues from services decreased in to million from million 
total revenues from services decreased in to million from million in total telecom revenues from services decreased in to million from million in the downward trend may continue until the company s existing and future customers ramp up their development efforts 
total software licensing revenues increased in to million from million in the increase was primarily due to the completion of several major projects in the united states that were delayed in and the company s focus on transitioning from being a custom software services provider to becoming a software product developer 
software licensing revenues decreased in to million from million in the decline is primarily the result of the discontinuance of non telecom product lines in late total telecom software licensing revenues decreased in the decline in telecom software licensing fees in is attributed to delays with our system deployments in north america 
prior to  the demand centered more on follow on services than on new licenses 
the company expects software licensing revenues to continue to vary on a quarterly and annual basis 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the years ended december  the percentage of revenues by geographic location are summarized as follows revenues united states asia pacific europe telecom revenues united states asia pacific europe telecom revenues from the united states increased to million in the increase was the result of continued relationships with existing customers  particularly lucent technologies and the result of completing several major projects with our telecom service providers 
the increase was the result of continued relationships with existing customers  particularly nec corporation  resulting in revenues from follow on contracts signed in in and  revenue decreased as a result of merger activity among the regional bell operating companies rboc s that slowed the decision making process 
this also contributed to low bookings and delayed deployments 
in  telecom revenue from the asia pacific region continues to remain strong  roughly the same as  due to continued relationships with existing customers resulting in revenues from follow on contracts signed in telecom revenue from europe fell to of total revenue for from in the decline was attributed largely to slow channel development 
the company generally realizes services revenues involving design  development  testing  and deployment over a twelve to eighteen month period 
the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue in future periods 
to date  a significant portion of revenues has been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
in   and  total revenues from the company s five largest telecom customers represented   and of revenues  respectively 
in  one customer with multiple contracts  nec corporation  represented approximately of total revenues and lucent technologies  represented approximately of total revenues 
the company anticipates that it will continue to experience significant customer concentration 
there can be no assurance that such customers or any other customers will continue to place orders with the company that will equal or exceed the comparable levels for prior periods 
costs of services the company incurs direct costs in the development and deployment of its customers software solutions 
the major components of direct costs are employee compensation  subcontractor fees  training costs  and other billable direct costs  including travel expenses 
direct costs also include an allocation for benefits  facilities  telephone expenses  information systems support  depreciation  and amortization of intangibles 
costs of services declined to million in from million in costs of services decreased in from million in as a percentage of service revenues  cost of services were   and for   and  respectively 
the cost of service percentage for remained relatively consistent with the cost of service percentage for cost of services declined while service revenues declined from levels 
the cost of service percentage may remain at or go below levels until existing and future customers ramp up their development efforts 
in  costs of services included increased investments in the completion of a number of north american telecom software solutions 
such customer related investments were reduced in the first half of thereby contributing to lower direct costs of services in in addition  the decline in cost of services in compared to is also attributable to the divestiture of non telecom business units in late management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued product development product development includes employee compensation  subcontractor fees  training costs  and other product development costs for existing and potential new software products  including an allocation for benefits  facilities  telephone expenses  information systems support  and depreciation 
prior to  customers had primarily funded the company s product development as part of the development of software applications 
as a result  internally funded product development costs had not been material 
during  the company began internally funding its product development costs 
the company invested million  or of revenues  in product development in compared to million  or of revenues  in product development in in  the company invested million  or of revenues  in product development 
during  product development spending increased  reflecting the company s continuing commitment to become a true software product developer 
in december  tcsi acquired gte s network management organization gte nmo which provided the company with an established customer base particularly in the emerging carrier segment and a new product development center in the pacific northwest 
in  product development costs included telecom product development costs from two major upgrades of solutioncore as well as non telecom product development costs from its divested business units 
in  the funds were used primarily for enhancements made to solutioncore 
the company expects to continue to invest in solution core r as well as its new component based applications  solutionsuites 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s product development spending will result in the successful introduction of new products 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling expenses include sales and marketing employee compensation  promotional material  trade shows  travel  and facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses include compensation costs related to executive management  finance  and administrative personnel along with the other administrative costs including recruiting  legal and accounting fees  insurance  and bad debt expense 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in the decline was primarily due to cost reduction efforts and an allocation of telephone and information systems support expenses to the internal users offset by one time payments in connection with the gte nmo acquisition 
in  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased from million in the decline was primarily due to the discontinuance of non telecom business units in late  as well as the company s business realignment decisions made during the past year 
selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were   and in   and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in is primarily attributable to the decline in total revenues for the year compared to total revenues 
write off of in process technology acquired in connection with the acquisition of gte nmo  the company wrote off approximately  of in process technology acquired in the fourth quarter of because the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
nonrecurring special items in  the company recorded a nonrecurring gain of  following the settlement of litigation related to the sale of a non telecom business unit 
in  the company concluded the sale of equipment resulting in a nonrecurring loss of million 
in  the company recorded a nonrecurring gain of million related to the licensing of its embedded wireless technology to atmel corporation atmel 
these gains and losses are described in further detail below 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in  atmel made a claim under the tcsi atmel corporation purchase agreement 
in  management obtained an equitable settlement of this matter with the escrow agent releasing  of a million escrow fund plus interest to tcsi  and the remaining  less fees to atmel 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a nonrecurring gain of  the company incurred a charge to operations of million in the first two quarters of resulting from adjustments to the market value of equipment held for resale related to the termination of a transportation contract in the third quarter of the company concluded the sale of the equipment in the third quarter of related to this same agreement  in the third quarter of  the company recorded a charge of approximately million to cover the costs related to the termination of this agreement 
the customer paid the company approximately million to terminate the agreement 
as part of the company s strategy to focus on its core telecom operations  in november  the company licensed its embedded wireless technology and related product lines to atmel corporation atmel in exchange for atmel common stock valued at million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a gain on this licensing of its technology  net of transaction costs and project commitments  totaling million and a gain of approximately million from the sale of the atmel stock described as gain on sale of investment in common stock in the consolidated statement of operations 
income tax provision benefit tcsi recorded an income tax provision benefit of million  million  and  for   and respectively 
the tax provision for differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded in the current year of million 
the valuation allowance was provided to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount which management believes is recognizable  based on the weight of available evidence  on a more likely than not basis 
at december   the company had approximately million of deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance of million 
realization of tcsi s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
however  the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced which would negatively impact the company s income tax provision in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years   and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities for primarily reflected a net loss of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease in receivables of million  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  and an increase in accounts payable of million 
cash flows from operating activities for primarily reflected a net loss of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of million  decreases in accounts payable of million and in accrued liabilities of million  and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
cash flows from operating activities for primarily reflected net income of approximately  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of million  and decreases in receivables and income taxes payable of million and million  respectively 
in the first quarter of  year end liabilities related to the buildout of the alameda facility in the first quarter of were paid 
in addition  there was a decrease in accrued liabilities resulting from reductions in bonus and commission payments in compared to other significant changes are the decreases in deferred revenue and income taxes payable 
the decrease in deferred revenue from is primarily attributable to the decrease in the volume management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of contracts being entered into that incorporate prepayments and to the completion of several major projects 
the decrease in income taxes payable over is consistent with the refunds received during investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years   and  respectively 
the company purchased million  million  and million of marketable securities in   and  respectively  while million  million  and million of marketable securities matured or were sold in each respective year 
during the year  the company shifted a portion of its investment portfolio into longer term noncurrent marketable securities in anticipation of the predicted decline in interest rates 
in addition  the company acquired gte nmo  this contributed to decreases in cash flows from investing activities of million in the net decrease in cash flows from investing activities also included million of cash used for capital expenditures in compared to million of cash used for capital expenditures and leasehold improvements during the capital expenditures during are primarily related to the consolidation of the company s facilities in northern california and to the establishment of the company s office in the united kingdom 
management expects cash used in investing activities will continue to vary on a quarterly and annual basis and from time to time  it may acquire businesses  products  or technologies to enhance the company s current product offerings 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million for the years   and  respectively 
the decrease from to was primarily the result of a decrease in stock options exercised and stock purchased pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan which is a function of market conditions and investment decisions made by employees 
the decrease from to was due to the fact that the company raised funds through a follow on public offering  realizing net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  in  cash flows from financing activities included million of tax benefits from stock options  there were no cash flows from tax benefits of stock option in and additional information on liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million 
the company believes that existing cash balances including cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with existing sources of liquidity  including cash flows from operating activities  will provide adequate cash to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months 
the company also has noncurrent marketable securities totaling million 
over the past three years  the company has satisfied its liquidity needs principally through cash flows from operating activities 
however  fluctuating receivable balances may affect the company s operating cash flows in the future 
the company s receivables are primarily from large  credit worthy customers in the telecommunications industry 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral 
allowances are maintained for potential credit losses 
to date  such losses have been within management s expectations 
during  working capital decreased from million in to million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the purchase of gte nmo 
during  working capital increased million to million at december  the increase is primarily due to the maturity of approximately million of long term marketable securities that were reinvested in short term instruments and the receipt of approximately million in income tax refunds 
cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million in compared to cash provided by financing activities declined million to million in compared to in and  the cash provided by financing activities was received as a result of the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  the company raised approximately million from the licensing of its embedded wireless software in late at december   the company had no outstanding debt 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued certain factors that may affect future results and market price of stock statements in this report which are prefaced with words such as expects  anticipates  believes and similar words and other statements of similar sense  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on the company s current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances which may or may not be within the company s control and as to which there can be no firm assurances given 
these forward looking statements  like any other forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
the following discussion highlights some of the risks the company faces 
potential fluctuations in future operating results the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results on a quarterly or an annual basis as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the cancellation  modification  or non renewal of service  license  or maintenance agreements  the size and timing of significant customer engagements and license fees  the relative proportion of services and software licensing fees  personnel changes  capital spending patterns of the company s customers  concentration of the company s customers  the lengthy sales cycles of the company s products and services  industry acceptance of the company s products and services  changes in operating expenses  new product introductions and product enhancements by the company or its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  introduce  and market new products and product enhancements on a timely basis  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  regulatory changes  currency fluctuations  and general economic factors 
these factors are difficult to forecast  and these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
historically  a portion of the company s revenue has been derived from software licensing fees from a limited number of customers 
variability in the timing of such license fees has caused  and may continue to cause  material fluctuations in the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company s products and services generally require significant capital expenditures by customers as well as the commitment of resources to implement  monitor  and test the company s enhancements to such systems 
accordingly  the company is substantially dependent on its customers decisions as to the timing and level of such expenditures and resource commitments 
in addition  the company typically realizes a significant portion of license revenues in the last weeks or even days of a quarter 
as a result  the magnitude of quarterly fluctuations may not become evident until late in  or after the close of  a particular quarter 
the company s expenses are based in part on the company s expectations as to future revenue levels and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
if revenues do not meet expectations  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition are likely to be materially adversely affected 
in particular  because only a small portion of the company s expenses varies with revenues  results of operations may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenues 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
lengthy sales and implementation cycles the company s products are typically intended for use in applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
the licensing and implementation of the company s software products generally involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
as a result  the company s sales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany significant capital expenditures 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycles associated with the licensing of the company s products are often lengthy historically averaging approximately nine to twelve months and subject to a number of significant delays over which the company has little or no control 
in addition  the company does not recognize service revenues until the services are rendered 
the time required to implement the company s products can vary significantly with the needs of its customers and is generally a process that extends for several months 
because of their complexity  larger implementations may take multiple quarters to complete 
from time to time  the company has provided services to implement certain large projects  and  although no contractual basis exists for the customer to do so  certain customers have delayed payment of a portion of service fees and in some cases have disputed the fees charged 
there can be no assurance the company will not experience additional management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued delays or disputes regarding payment in the future  particularly if the company receives orders for large  complex installations 
therefore  the company believes that its quarterly and annual operating results and financial condition are likely to vary significantly in the future 
acceptance of the company s products  product development risks a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from the sale of the company s component based software products and services which provide software solutions to major corporations in the worldwide telecom services and equipment industries 
although many telecom companies currently seek to integrate their business operation systems and network operation systems  there can be no assurance that these or other service providers will continue to seek the integration of such systems or that such companies will use the company s products 
due to the complex nature of the advanced operations support systems oss developed by the company  the company has in the past relied  and will in the future continue to rely  on its development and implementation expertise 
the company continues to develop software products that reduce the customization necessary to fully integrate customers systems 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will continue to successfully develop and market such products or  even if successful  that the revenue from such products will compensate for any concurrent loss of development and implementation service revenues 
the failure by the company to successfully develop and market such products and technologies would have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
revenues attributable to the company s products and services have in the past accounted for  and are expected to continue to account for  a substantial majority of the company s revenues 
accordingly  the company s future business  operating results  and financial condition are significantly dependent upon the continued market acceptance of its portfolio of products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company s technology will continue to achieve market acceptance or that the company will be successful in developing  introducing  or marketing improvements to its products 
moreover  the life cycle of component based products is difficult to estimate due in large part to the recent changes in the telecom markets  the effect of future product enhancements  and competition 
a decline in the demand for the company s software as a result of new or existing competing technologies or other factors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
management intends to target product development spending at amounts consistent with other software companies 
there can be no assurance  however  that such funding will result in the successful introduction of new products 
customer concentration to date  a significant portion of the company s revenues has been concentrated among a limited number of customers 
in particular  in  a large portion of revenues was derived from contracts negotiated through a large equipment manufacturer in asia 
while the economic crisis in asia has not materially adversely affected the company  there can be no assurance that it will not do so in the future 
in addition  the company anticipates that it will continue to experience significant customer concentration 
there can be no assurance that such customers or any other customers will in the future continue to place orders with the company which equal or exceed the comparable levels for prior periods 
in addition  the company s customers typically designate one individual to procure network management software 
if any of such individuals were terminated  transferred  or replaced  the company would be vulnerable to cancellation of an order if  for example  the company s competitors had preexisting relationships with such individual s replacement 
as a result of these factors  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
product defects the company provides complex software products for major telecom equipment manufacturers  systems integrators  and service providers 
the development and enhancement of such complex software entails substantial risks of product defects 
the company has in the past identified software defects in certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that errors will not be found in existing or new products or releases after commencement of commercial licensing  which may result in delay or loss of revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  or may otherwise adversely impact the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued implementation risks as is characteristic of companies providing software solutions to the telecom industry  the complexities involved in implementing the company s software solutions entail risks of performance shortfalls 
from time to time  the company has agreed to accept some financial responsibility  in the form of negotiated penalty amounts  when the company s products did not meet specifications or caused customer system downtime 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter similar delays or other difficulties due to such implementation complexities in the future 
because the company s customer base consists of a relatively limited number of customers  the product defects or implementation errors would be potentially damaging to the company s reputation 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
international sales revenues outside of north america accounted for of the company s total revenues for the year ended december  the company expects that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenue in future periods 
the company intends to penetrate additional international markets and to further expand its existing international operations 
the company s international business involves a number of inherent risks  including greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and  therefore  longer accounts receivable collection periods  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  a longer sales cycle than with domestic customers  potentially unstable political and economic conditions  language barriers  cultural differences in the conduct of business  seasonality  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including a slowdown in the rate of privatization of telecom service providers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  while the recent economic crisis in asia has not materially adversely affected the company  there can be no assurance that it will not do so in the future 
also  access to foreign markets is often difficult due to the established relationships between government owned or controlled communications companies and local suppliers of communications products 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to successfully penetrate such foreign markets 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain or increase revenue derived from international licensing and services or that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international business  and consequently  on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
international sales also entail risks associated with currency fluctuations 
the company has attempted to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates associated with international revenue by pricing its products and services in united states dollars whenever possible 
the company  however  generally pays the expenses of its international operations in local currencies and does not engage in hedging transactions with respect to such obligations 
upward fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to foreign customers  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability 
furthermore  future international activity may result in foreign currency denominated sales  and  in such event  gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in the company s operating results 
dependence on telecommunications carriers  government regulation many of the company s principal customers are major telecom carriers 
such companies operate within the telecom industry  which has been characterized by intense competition in the development of new technology  equipment  and customer services 
the company believes that large telecom carriers have become increasingly cautious in making significant capital expenditures  due in part to increased competition from smaller  rapidly developing alternative carriers  decreasing prices for telecom services and equipment  and regulatory rate structures that have become less dependent on the level of carriers capital expenditures 
these and other factors have in the past and may in the future cause such customers to experience significant fluctuations in capital expenditures for oss software 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the telecom industry is subject to extensive regulation in the united states and other countries  and the company s customers generally must receive regulatory approvals in conducting their businesses 
although the telecom industry has been characterized by government deregulation and liberalization  there can be no assurance that such trends will continue or that reregulation will not occur 
government regulatory policies are likely to continue to have a major impact on the company s ability to attract and retain customers 
for example  regulatory authorities may continue to oversee the pricing of new and existing telecom services  and the pricing may  in turn  impact carriers ability to make significant capital expenditures 
the enactment by federal  state  or foreign governments of new laws or regulations or change in the interpretation of existing regulations could adversely affect the company s customers  and thereby affect the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
competition the company offers products and services in the evolving market for telecommunications oss software 
competition in this market is intense and is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  changing regulatory requirements  frequent new product introductions  and rapid changes in customer requirements 
to maintain and improve its competitive position  the company must continue to develop  acquire  license and introduce  in a timely and cost effective manner  new services  products  and product features that keep pace with competitive offerings by telecom companies and independent software vendors 
the principal competitive factors in the company s market are quality  performance  price  customer support  corporate reputation  and product features such as scalability  interoperability  functionality  customizability  and ease of use 
the company faces competition in each of the three functional areas that the company believes are necessary for the delivery of complete network management software solutions development environments  turnkey applications  and custom services 
the company s solutioncore and solutionsuites product lines enable the company to provide its customers with both application development software and telecom applications 
because certain of the company s competitors focus only on one functional area of oss software  such competitors may be in a position to develop competitive products targeted solely at the segment they serve 
these competitors include major communications service providers and equipment and computer manufacturers  each of which may have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than the company  and may also have greater name recognition and longer standing relationships with customers than the company may have 
furthermore  many of the company s current and potential customers continuously evaluate whether to design  develop  and support internally the software solutions provided by the company  thereby obviating the customer s need to rely on an outside vendor such as the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or potential competitors will not develop products comparable or superior to those developed by the company or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies  evolving industry standards  new product introductions  or changing customer requirements 
rapid technological change  need to manage product transitions the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  changing regulatory environments  frequent new product introductions  and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
as a result  the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
this poses substantial risks for the company because the company s products and software solutions typically have lengthy development and sales cycles 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and product features that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the evolving needs of its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product features that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards  that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction  and marketing of these new products and features  or that its new products or product features will adequately meet the requirements of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce enhancements of existing products or new products in a timely manner  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the company s products are designed to operate on a variety of hardware and software platforms and with a variety of databases employed by its customers in their networks 
the company must continually modify and enhance its products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms and database technology 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements and introductions or modifications by systems vendors and by vendors of relational database software could materially adversely impact the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  the failure of the company s products to operate across the various existing and evolving versions of hardware and software platforms and database environments employed by consumers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the introduction or announcement of products by the company or one or more of its competitors embodying new technologies  or changes in industry standards or customer requirements  could render the company s software products and solutions obsolete or unmarketable 
the introduction of new or enhanced versions of its products requires the company to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering 
there can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by the company or one or more of its competitors will not cause customers to defer licensing of existing company products or engaging the company s services 
any deferral of license or service revenues could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
protection of intellectual property the company s success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements  and technical measures to protect its proprietary rights 
to date  the company has patents and patents pending related to its telecom products 
the company expects to continue to file patent applications where it believes it is appropriate to protect its proprietary technologies 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will prevent misappropriation of such technology  and such steps may not preclude competitors from developing products with functionality or features similar to the company s products 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the failure of the company to protect its proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
while the company believes that its products and trademarks and their use by customers does not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that the company will not receive future communications from third parties asserting that the company s products or their use by customers infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of such third parties 
the company expects that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the numbers of products and competitors in the company s industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  including meritless claims  could result in costly  time consuming litigation  and diversion of technical and management personnel 
in the event any third party was to make a valid claim and a license was not made available on commercially reasonable terms  or if the company was unable to develop non infringing alternative technology  the company s business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  certain of the company s customers regard the solutions provided by the company to be proprietary to such customers and may attempt to prohibit the company from using or otherwise benefiting from certain of the advances made in developing such solutions 
although the company intends to increasingly standardize its integration solutions through the use of component based software products  there can be no assurance that the prohibition or restrictions management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued imposed by certain customers on the use of certain intellectual property will not adversely affect the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company relies on certain software that it licenses from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in the company s products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue to be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or that such licenses will not be terminated 
although the company believes that alternative software is available from other third party suppliers  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance their products in a timely and cost effective manner could result in delays or reductions in product shipments by the company until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed  and integrated  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s future growth and success depends to a significant extent on its ability to attract and retain qualified managerial  sales  and software engineering personnel 
the company has at times experienced and continues to experience difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
the company s future success will also depend on the ability of its current and future management personnel to operate effectively  both independently and as a group 
the company has recently experienced changes in its executive management 
for example  in november  the company appointed a new vice president of marketing 
competition for the hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in locating candidates with appropriate qualifications 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
risks associated with acquisitions the company periodically evaluates potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products  and technologies 
to support its growth plans  the company may acquire companies that have a significant installed base of products not yet offered by the company  have strategic distribution channels or customer relationships  or otherwise present opportunities which management believes enhance the company s competitive position 
for example  in december  the company acquired gte nmo 
this provided the company with an established customer base  particularly in the emerging carrier segment and a new product development center in the pacific northwest 
such acquisitions could subject the company to numerous risks  including risks associated with the integration into the company of new employees and technology 
moreover  the negotiation and acquisition of such transactions involve the diversion of substantial management resources and the evaluation of such opportunities requires substantial diversion of engineering and technological resources 
in addition  transactions involving the issuance by the company of common stock or other securities could result in immediate and substantial dilution to the company s existing shareholders  large one time write offs  or the creation of goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in amortization expenses 
the failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate  and effect acquisition transactions  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
volatility of stock price the market price of the shares of the company s common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s business  operating results  and financial condition  announcements of technological innovations  new products  or new contracts by the company or its competitors  developments with respect to proprietary rights  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry  general market conditions  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for technology company stocks 
these types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results  and financial condition 
in this regard  in late  two lawsuits on behalf of certain of the company s shareholders were filed against the company and various of its officers and directors 
in late september  a class action lawsuit was filed in us federal court on behalf of certain shareholders against the company and various of its officers and directors 
the state actions allege violations of state securities laws during and  and the federal action alleges violations of the federal securities laws 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to all of these actions and intends to defend each of them vigorously 
in the opinion of management  resolution of these legal actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 
however  depending on the amount and timing  an unfavorable resolution of any of these matters could materially affect the company s future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than one year  computer systems and software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
in early  the company developed procedures for evaluating and managing the risks and costs associated with year problems 
tcsi believes it is devoting the necessary resources to identify and modify its systems and products impacted by the year problem and to implement new systems and release new product versions to become year compliant in a timely manner 
the company has concluded its assessment of the year issues and has determined that the consequences of its year issues will not have a material effect on its business  results of operations  or financial conditions 
the company believes its products are year compliant 
the company believes that its costs associated with implementing these procedures will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
however  there can be no assurance that unexpected delays or increased costs associated with implementation will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s software contains all date code changes necessary to prevent processing errors potentially arising from calculations using the year date 
any disruptions in product development or other operations of the company as a result of year noncompliance would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
tcsi believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may also be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to upgrade their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products such as those offered by the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company s customers and suppliers are or will be year compliant 
failure of the company s customers and suppliers to address the year issues at all  sufficiently  or in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
as of december   the company s cash and investment portfolio includes fixed income securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of the company s investment portfolio  an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of the company s portfolio 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates in its investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk 
the majority of the company s revenues are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  the company has relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
