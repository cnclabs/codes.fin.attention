these cost savings have resulted primarily from a significant reduction of the company s stock keeping units  the rationalization of manufacturing and warehouse facilities and a major restructuring of its administrative and marketing and selling functions 
although the company expects most of these cost savings to continue in future years  there is no assurance that they will be achieved

during fiscal  the company reduced by 
million 
million after taxes  or 
per share on a basic and diluted basis some of its reserves in connection with its business divestitures

see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company reduced in fiscal by 
million 
million after taxes  or 
per share on a basic and diluted basis some of its reserves established in connection with its disposal of a discontinued business 
this reduction was largely attributable to lower than expected costs associated with accruals  primarily for accounts receivable and fixed assets  established at the time of the divestiture 
this business divestiture is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and notes to consolidated financial statements 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion is on a continuing operations basis 
as a result of the above divestitures  including the discontinued business  an aggregate of approximately million of revenue on an annualized basis and related profit will not be available to the company going forward 
management believes a critical part of the strategic plan is to offset these revenue and earnings losses through increased focus on the company s graphics products in the high growth digital imaging  and sign and display markets  through leveraging of the company s brand strength in consumer products  from internal new product development and through acquisitions 
also  management believes improved manufacturing processes  rationalization of distribution facilities  and savings in administrative  marketing and selling support areas will help offset these losses 
comparison of fiscal vs

export sales of consumer products decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower sales in canada and latin america  resulting principally from the decrease in the value of the canadian dollar and to general softness in demand as a result of current economic conditions in latin america 
graphics products sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this sales increase was attributable to higher sales of supplies products up  partially offset by lower laminating equipment products sales down 
the increase in supplies products was due principally to higher sales of mounting and laminating supplies to the wide format digital imaging market  and to higher sales of board products ie project display board 
the decrease in laminating equipment products sales was due primarily to softness in demand for such products in asia and latin america  and to a lessor extent in the us export sales of graphics products remained essentially unchanged in fiscal from fiscal foreign sales of graphics products also were essentially unchanged in fiscal from a year ago  with higher sales of supplies products offset by lower sales of laminating equipment 
changes in currency exchange rates from year to year had an insignificant impact on foreign sales in fiscal during the latter part of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company experienced some general softness in demand for its products in asia and latin america  primarily as a result of the current economic situations there

these higher costs in were partially offset by the cost saving initiatives undertaken as part of the implementation of the company s strategic plan the gross profit percentages for foreign sales were in fiscal and in fiscal excluding the effect of special items 
although the company has experienced a stabilization of costs for some of its raw materials  management is uncertain if these conditions will continue

should the company require additional funds  management believes that the company could obtain them at competitive costs 
year issues the year yk issue is the result of computer programs being written for  or microprocessors using  two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
company computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in system failures or miscalculations 
the company is currently working to mitigate the yk issue and has established processes for assessing the risks and associated costs 
the company has been formally addressing its yk issues during the past few years 
these efforts involve assessment  identification of non compliant systems  remediation  testing  and verification  including replacing and or updating existing systems 
the company has completed the necessary modifications to most of its critical systems and applications 
to date  the project is proceeding on schedule and is expected to be completed during fiscal the company also has initiated communications with significant suppliers and customers to identify and coordinate the remediation of any yk issues  and is in the process of determining the company s vulnerability if these companies fail to remediate their yk issues 
costs incurred to date in addressing the yk issues have not been significant and are being funded through operating cash flows 
the total implementation costs relating principally to new hardware and software capitalized to date are million  which should represent substantially all of the capitalized costs to be incurred 
these costs not only addressed yk issues but also provided for operational efficiencies and costs reductions which will benefit the company in the future 
the company continues to evaluate possible future costs associated with these efforts based on actual experience but does not currently anticipate that such costs will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company currently believes that its systems will be fully operational and will not cause any material disruptions because of yk issues  but there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
further  because of the uncertainties associated with assessing effect on preparedness of suppliers and customers  there is a risk of a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations if these constituencies do not correct their yk problems  if any  on a timely basis 
the company plans to continue assessing these risks through reviews with its major suppliers and customers 
contingency plans will be developed to deal with any problems which may become known as a result of these reviews 
contingency plans relating to suppliers and customers  if necessary  will be developed by the end of fiscal european monetary union euro on january   several member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies  and adopted the euro as their new common legal currency 
as of that date  the euro trades on currency exchanges and the participating countries own currencies legacy currencies remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period between january  and january  during the transition period parties can elect to pay for goods and services and transact business using either the euro or a legacy currency 
between january  and july   the participating countries will introduce euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies so that these legacy currencies will no longer be available 
the euro conversion may affect cross border competition by creating cross border price transparency 
the company has assessed its pricing marketing strategy in order to ensure that it remains competitive in a broader european market 
the company has also assessed its information technology systems to allow for transactions to take place in both the legacy currencies and the euro and the eventual elimination of the legacy currencies  and has modified certain existing contracts 
the company s currency risk and risk management for operations in participating countries may be reduced as the legacy currencies are converted to the euro 
the company will continue to evaluate issues involving introduction of the euro 
based on current information and the company s current assessment  management does not expect that the euro conversion will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows
