item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations worksafe operated in the manufacturing and distribution industry segments until the end of its second fiscal quarter for the year ending june   when it sold its distribution business 
since such sale  worksafe continues only its manufacturing operation 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced worksafe s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
worksafe s continuing operations now consist of its manufacturing operation which produces limited use and reusable industrial apparel and protective knit gloves 
worksafe maintains facilities for warehousing and production in puerto rico  alabama  mexico a contractor  texas  california  louisiana and minnesota 
the accompanying financial statements have been restated to reflect the former distribution division as a discontinued operation and management s discussion and analysis discusses only the continuing operations 
results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the year ended june   were approximately  as compared to approximately  for the year ended june   a decrease of 
this decrease in sales in fiscal was in large part due to the fact that manufacturing inventory which normally would have been sold directly to customers during the second half of fiscal was instead transferred as part of the second quarter transaction with arbill  who in turn sold the inventory to their customers 
in addition  in prior years  the company realized as part of its manufacturing sales  the sales price to end users 
since the sale to arbill of the discontinued operations  the sales price realized was the price to arbill  a distributor  where the sales price is lower than the price to the end user 
worksafe s gross margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal these reductions are the continuing results of the competitive environment in the marketplace as well as the lower margins on sales to distributors as opposed to end users 
in a continued effort to increase margin levels  worksafe continues to take major steps to reduce overhead expenses  ie by producing more products in mexico  and increasing efficiencies in material utilization 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june   were approximately  of sales  compared to approximately  of sales  for the same period last year 
this decrease as a percentage of sales was mainly due to lower salaries and related benefits 
the company took advantage of more vendor rebates in fiscal  due to improved cash availability 
interest expense was approximately  for fiscal  an increase of approximately  when compared to fiscal income from continuing operations for fiscal decreased to  as compared to  for fiscal this decrease was a direct result of the aforementioned decrease in sales and gross margins 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales during fiscal increased to approximately  from approximately  during fiscal this increase included approximately  of incremental sales attributable to the glove division that was acquired in april worksafe believes that the overall increase in sales was due to increased demand for worksafe s products  the improvement in its inventory position and the continued overall improvement in industry conditions 
the gross profit percentage increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this increase in gross profit was caused in part by i continued increases in production levels by our contractor in mexico at lower costs for products previously produced in puerto rico and alabama and ii continued production efficiencies in puerto rico and alabama 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately  or of sales compared to approximately  or of sales for fiscal this increase was primarily due to i  in incremental expenses attributable to the glove division acquired april and ii an increase in total non glove operations commissions of  attributable to increased sales 
interest expense was approximately  for fiscal as compared to approximately  in the prior year 
this increase was principally due to an increase in average borrowings in fiscal on worksafe s asset based facility with congress as well as a full year s interest on additional borrowings from congress used to purchase the minnesota glove business in april worksafe s income from continuing operations for fiscal was approximately  as compared to a net loss of approximately  in fiscal this increase was caused by increased sales and an increase in gross margins offset in part by a loss of approximately  including  in depreciation and amortization related to the glove division acquired in april  along with a fourth quarter loss in fiscal of approximately  which was primarily the result of selling price reductions on certain worksafe products due to competition  market conditions  and cash flow requirements 
liquidity and capital resources worksafe had working capital as of june   inclusive of net assets of discontinued operations  of approximately  as compared to approximately  as of june  a substantial portion of worksafe s working capital consists of inventory  which was approximately  and  as of june  and  respectively 
this inventory reduction is mainly due to worksafe closing its warehouses in new york  florida and connecticut as part of its arbill transaction at which time arbill bought all manufacturing inventory contained therein 
although the manufacturing division maintains a minimum level of inventory for its basic products  its back order position is expected to keep inventory at lower levels  thereby having a positive effect on liquidity 
worksafe believes that its current working capital position will be sufficient to satisfy its needs for the next twelve months 
worksafe has a line of credit agreement with congress  which expires october  the line provides for borrowings up to  with interest payable monthly at 
in excess of prime unless for the year ending june   worksafe is not profitable  then the interest rate becomes above the prime rate  and an unused line fee of a year 
the maximum amount worksafe can borrow on the inventory portion is  the limits on borrowings remain at of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory 
the amounts outstanding at june   and june   were approximately  and  respectively 
worksafe had  available for borrowing at june   based on its formula with congress 
in addition  worksafe may also borrow up to an additional  until december   at which time such additional loans are payable in full 
the loan is subject to certain working capital and net worth requirements and is collateralized by all of the assets of worksafe not previously pledged under other loan agreements 
the loan agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends by worksafe 
at june   worksafe was not in compliance with the tangible net worth requirement of the line of credit agreement 
congress has since amended such covenant such that worksafe is in compliance 
net cash provided by operating activities was principally a result of a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory  which was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash flows used in investing activities was for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
cash flows used in financing activities were principally a result of net paydowns of worksafe s loan with congress 
on september   the board of directors of worksafe approved a buy back plan of up to  shares of worksafe s common stock to be purchased over the next two years at the discretion of worksafe 
congress has authorized worksafe to expend up to  for such purchase 
no shares have been purchased to date

there can be no assurances that worksafe will be profitable or will not incur losses in the future 
worksafe is dependent upon its revolving line of credit with congress

there can be no assurances that there will be other sources of financing for worksafe  if required 
the registrant is a party to approximately  cases involving approximately  plaintiffs  as of june  with respect to asbestos litigation and additional asbestos actions continue to be brought against it 
during the year ended june   approximately  asbestos actions concerning approximately  plaintiffs have been brought against the registrant 
to date  worksafe believes that its insurance coverage has been adequate for those actions previously terminated  but there can be no assurances that such coverage will continue to be adequate in the future

for a more complete discussion on asbestos litigation and worksafe s insurance coverage  reference is made to item of this form k and future filings under form q 
worksafe has competitors that have greater financial  management  sales and technical resources than worksafe 
worksafe s success also depends to a significant degree on the contributions of its key management 
the loss of services of one or more key members of management could have an adverse affect upon worksafe 
worksafe is also dependent upon dupont which supplies worksafe with tyvek r which is used for various lines of worksafe s limited use products 
management believes that its current relationship with dupont is satisfactory

this agreement  subject to its terms  continues in effect until january  management expects that based upon its past relationship with dupont  although there can be no assurances  that this agreement will be extended 
loss of dupont as a supplier of tyvek r would have material adverse effects on worksafe s operations 
worksafe is also required to maintain substantial inventory for its operations in order to meet the immediate requirements of its customers who require products on short notice 
there can be no assurances that worksafe will be able to maintain sufficient inventory or that worksafe will not return to periods where there is not sufficient working capital to maintain its inventory to meet the needs of its customers 
worksafe also enjoys the benefits of various tax incentives with respect to its operations in puerto rico which are described in item of part i of this form k 
as puerto rico s tax exemptions are reduced or expire  worksafe may be required to pay taxes on income earned in puerto rico 
worksafe is unable to predict the amount of such impact after such exemptions are reduced or expire 
due to the foregoing  the market price of worksafe s common stock may be volatile at times in response to fluctuations of worksafe s operating results  changes in analyst earnings estimates  market conditions as well as general conditions and other factors general to worksafe 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk worksafe s principal financial instrument is its revolving line of credit with congress that provides for interest at the prime rate plus 
worksafe is affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable by the company under the revolving line of credit 
a significant rise in the prime rate could materially adversely affect worksafe s business  financial condition and results of operations 
at june   an aggregate principal amount of approximately million was outstanding under the revolver 
if principal amounts outstanding under worksafe s revolving line of credit remained at this level for an entire year and the prime increased or decreased  respectively  by  worksafe would pay or save  respectively  an additional  in interest in that year 
worksafe does not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose
