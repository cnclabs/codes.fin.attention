item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and selected financial and operating data included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a leading nationwide owner  operator and franchisor of quick service restaurants  operating principally under the carl s jr  taco bueno and hardee s brand names 
based on domestic systemwide sales  our hardee s and carl s jr 
chains are the fourth and seventh largest quick service hamburger restaurant chains in the united states  respectively 
as of january   the carl s jr 
system included restaurants  of which we operated restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated restaurants 
the carl s jr 
restaurants are located in the western united states  predominantly in california with company operated carl s jr 
hardee s dual brand restaurants operating in texas  kansas and oklahoma and nine franchised carl s jr 
hardee s dual brand restaurants operating in oklahoma and colorado 
operating results for these carl s jr 
hardee s dual brand restaurants for fiscal and are included in the hardee s financial information 
beginning in fiscal  the operating results of these restaurants will be included in the carl s jr 
financial information 
as of january   the hardee s system consisted of  restaurants  of which we operated  restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated  restaurants 
hardee s are located throughout the eastern and midwestern united states  predominantly in the southeast 
as of january   we also operated taco bueno quick service mexican restaurants in texas and oklahoma 
carl n 
karcher  our founder  opened the first carl s jr 
restaurant in in anaheim  california 
after an extended period of growth  we made strategic decisions and experienced operational difficulties in the early s  which adversely impacted our sales and profitability 
at that time  in response to the introduction of value pricing by our quick service restaurant competitors  we reduced prices and initiated an extensive value priced menu advertising campaign 
beginning in october  we hired a new management team  which began implementing a variety of strategic and operational programs designed to revitalize the carl s jr 
brand and improve financial results 
we renewed our focus on offering superior products  eliminated most value priced menu items  launched a new advertising campaign  began a dual branding program with the green burrito and started a remodeling program for carl s jr 
restaurants 
we also were successful in reducing expenses at both the corporate and restaurant operating levels 
as a result of these strategies  we experienced significant improvements in sales and operating results in fiscal   and we completed this remodeling program in december and continue to implement our dual branding program and focus on reducing expenses 
we believe we will continue to benefit from such activities in the future 
we believe our acquisitions of hardee s in july and fei in april allowed us to significantly expand the scope of our operations and to become one of the leading nationwide operators of quick service hamburger restaurants 
because of the significant effect of the acquisitions of hardee s and fei on our results of operations  our historical results of operations and year to year comparisons will not be indicative of future results and may not be meaningful 
operating results of hardee s and fei are included in our results of operations from july  and april   respectively 
we acquired taco bueno and certain other restaurant concepts in fiscal  and our results of operations for fiscal  and include million  million and million  respectively  of revenues generated by these restaurants 
we derive our revenues primarily from sales by company operated restaurants and revenues from franchisees  including franchise and royalty fees  sales to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees of food and packaging products  rentals under real property leases and revenues from the sale of equipment to our franchisees 
restaurant operating expenses consist primarily of food and packaging costs  payroll and other employee benefits and occupancy and other operating expenses of company operated restaurants 
operating costs of our franchised and licensed restaurants include the cost of food and packaging products sold to carl s jr 
s franchisees and licensees  lease payments on properties subleased to our franchisees and the costs of equipment purchases 
hardee s had previously established allowances for certain franchisee notes receivable based upon the historical collection rates experienced by them 
since our acquisition  we have worked to restore hardee s relationships with its franchisees 
as a result of the improved relations with our franchisees and their improved operating performance  the collection rate on notes receivable has improved 
as such  in fiscal  we have reversed approximately million of allowances as the previously established amounts proved to be unnecessary 
other operating expenses  including advertising expenses and general and administrative expenses  relate to company operated restaurants as well as franchisee and licensee operations 
our revenues and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volume of company operated restaurants and  to a lesser extent  of franchised and licensed restaurants 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total revenues  unless otherwise indicated  of certain items included in our consolidated statements of income for the years indicated fiscal year ended january  revenues company operated restaurants franchised and licensed restaurants and other total revenues operating costs and expenses restaurant operations food and packaging payroll and other employee benefits occupancy and other operating expenses franchised and licensed restaurants and other advertising expenses general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes and extraordinary item income tax expense income before extraordinary item extraordinary item gain on early retirement of debt net income as a percentage of revenues from company operated restaurants 
as a percentage of revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants and other 
fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal compared with fiscal revenues company operated restaurants 
revenues from company operated restaurants increased million or to billion in fiscal as compared with fiscal carl s jr  hardee s and taco bueno company operated restaurant revenues for the year accounted for sales increases of million  million and million  respectively  offset in part by the decrease in revenues from our hometown buffet and casa bonita concepts  which were disposed of in connection with the initial public offering of star buffet  inc star buffet in september  and our jb s restaurants and galaxy diner restaurants which were sold to sbrg in september on a same store sales basis  our carl s jr 
sales increased  marking the fourth consecutive annual increase in same store sales for the carl s jr 
chain 
same store sales for our company operated taco bueno restaurants increased  while same store sales for our company operated hardee s restaurants decreased 
we believe that the overall increase in revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants can be primarily attributed to our continued focus on promoting great tasting new and existing food products through increased advertising  the continuation of our conversion of existing carl s jr 
locations into carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand restaurants  the image enhancement of our restaurants through a chain wide remodeling program which was completed in december and an increase in the number of company operated restaurants in operation in fiscal as compared with fiscal taco bueno s increase in revenues is due in part to a new advertising campaign  which also focuses on great tasting food products  and the systemwide installation of new menu boards and all you can drink beverage bars 
we also began an image enhancement program for our taco bueno restaurants and are focusing on real estate that is better located and more heavily trafficked than the properties previously targeted for new taco bueno restaurants 
the four taco bueno restaurants that have opened since october have average unit volumes significantly higher than the rest of the system 
the revenue increase from our hardee s restaurants was also driven by including a full year of operations of the restaurants initially acquired in july and by our acquisitions of fei and other franchised restaurants during fiscal we attribute much of the decrease in same store sales at hardee s to menu deletions made  as well as our discontinuation of promotional discounting and monthly new product introductions 
the particularly harsh weather experienced in the southeast and midwest during the fourth quarter of fiscal was also a contributing factor 
average unit volumes at our company operated carl s jr 
and taco bueno restaurants continue to rise and increased to  and to  respectively  as of january  for the trailing week period as compared with the prior year 
average unit volumes at our company operated hardee s restaurants ended the fiscal year at  revenues from company operated restaurants increased million or to billion in fiscal as compared with fiscal carl s jr 
company operated restaurant revenues for the year accounted for sales increases of million 
our hardee s and taco bueno restaurants contributed million and million  respectively  to the increase 
offsetting these increases is the loss of revenues from our hometown buffet and casa bonita restaurants that were disposed of in connection with the initial public offering of star buffet in september on a same store sales basis  our carl s jr 
sales increased  marking the third consecutive annual increase in same store sales for the carl s jr 
chain 
same store sales for taco bueno restaurants increased  while same store sales from company operated hardee s restaurants decreased since the date of acquisition 
the increase in revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants was primarily the result of continued momentum in our various sales enhancement programs  including the continuation of conversion of existing carl s jr 
locations into carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand restaurants  continued focus on promoting great tasting new and existing food products through increased innovative advertising and the image enhancement of our restaurants through a chain wide remodeling program 
also contributing to the increase in sales at our carl s jr 
restaurants was our introduction of the charbroiled sirloin steak sandwich in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which has recorded the highest sales levels for any new product offering in the past years 
the decrease in same store sales for hardee s can be attributed to several factors  including the paring down of hardee s oversized menu and the discontinuation of monthly new product introductions 
franchised and licensed restaurants 
our revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants for fiscal increased million  or  to million over fiscal this increase is mainly due to the addition of a full year of royalties earned by hardee s franchise system and a full year of equipment sales to hardee s franchisees  offset in part by the conversion of certain hardee s franchised restaurants into company operated restaurants  including our purchase of fei in april a large part of the increase can also be attributed to increased royalties from  and food purchases by  carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees as a result of higher sales volume at franchised and licensed carl s jr 
restaurants and the increase in the number of carl s jr 
franchised restaurants operating in fiscal as compared with fiscal our revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants in fiscal increased million  or  to million over fiscal this increase is principally due to royalties earned by hardee s franchise system  equipment sales to hardee s franchisees and to increased royalties from  and food purchases by  carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees as a result of higher sales volume at franchised and licensed carl s jr 
restaurants 
operating costs and expenses restaurant operations 
restaurant level operating margins of our consolidated restaurant operations increased in fiscal by to as compared with fiscal  primarily reflecting the improvement in operating margins at each of the company s three core concepts and the disposal of our remaining higher cost family style restaurant concepts in the third quarter of fiscal consolidated restaurant level operating margins decreased in fiscal by as compared with fiscal  primarily reflecting the impact of typically higher operating costs at our family style restaurant concepts  which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal  and at hardee s  which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal the family style segment of the restaurant industry typically has lower margins than the quick service segment of the industry  mainly due to increased labor and food costs 
although hardee s restaurant level operating margins are substantially lower than our carl s jr 
and taco bueno quick service restaurant concepts  we have increased hardee s company operated restaurant level operating margins to for fiscal  as compared with for the weeks ended january  and for those restaurants open and operating as of december  we have accomplished this reduction of costs through the following cost saving measures  each of which we implemented at our carl s jr 
restaurants over the past four to five years the introduction of the carl s jr 
labor matrix to refine labor usage  a focus on safety and accident prevention as a method of lowering workers compensation costs  the reduction of food waste and theft tolerance levels  and the use of purchasing synergies to lower food and paper costs 
the simplification of the hardee s menu and conforming hardee s depreciation policies also contributed to the increase in restaurant level operating margins since we acquired it 
continued cost saving strategies at our company operated carl s jr 
restaurants have caused restaurant level operating margins for our carl s jr 
chain to continue to increase 
these margins  as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants  were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
these improved results in our carl s jr 
restaurant level operating margins reflect our continued commitment to improve the cost structure of our carl s jr 
restaurants  particularly in the areas of increased purchasing synergies for food and paper  improved labor productivity and reduced workers compensation costs 
our carl s jr 
food and packaging costs continued to decrease during fiscal  down to of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants in fiscal  as compared with in fiscal  and in fiscal during fiscal and  food costs decreased due to the purchasing economies our carl s jr 
chain achieved as a result of the consolidated buying power directly realized from our addition of other restaurant concepts 
partially offsetting these purchasing economies realized in fiscal and fiscal  were increased pressure from commodity prices and a change in the product mix as a result of the promotion of larger  more expensive sandwiches such as the charbroiled sirloin steak sandwich  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal payroll and other employee benefits for our carl s jr 
restaurant chain  as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants  have remained relatively consistent at  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the october and september federal and march and california minimum wage increases contributed to the rise in payroll and employee benefit costs 
offsetting the impact of these partial year increases was the savings resulting from labor productivity programs implemented during fiscal to decrease costs further and improve direct labor efficiencies 
carl s jr 
occupancy and other operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues from company operated carl s jr 
restaurants  were   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
a portion of occupancy and other operating expenses is fixed in nature  and thus falls as a percentage of company operated revenues as revenues rise 
the decrease in occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of company operated restaurants in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  is largely due to our efforts to maintain costs at the prior fiscal year levels in conjunction with the fixed nature of the expenses and the increase in revenues in fiscal these costs increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal  primarily due to increased equipment costs as we implemented updated data technology at our restaurants and increased utility and depreciation expenses in connection with the remodeling of our carl s jr 
restaurants 
taco bueno s restaurant level operating margins increased to of revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal restaurant level operating margins of 
this increase was primarily due to the fixed nature of occupancy and other operating expenses combined with an increase in revenues  as well as the savings achieved from implementing some of the same labor productivity programs successfully implemented at our carl s jr 
restaurants in the past four to five years 
offsetting these benefits was the negative impact of the increased commodity costs for cheese and tomatoes and increased lease expense for the new point of sale equipment installed in all of our taco bueno restaurants 
franchised and licensed restaurants 
franchised and licensed restaurant and other costs increased to million in fiscal over fiscal and to million in fiscal over fiscal these increases are primarily due to increased food and other products purchased from us by carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees as well as the costs associated with administering the hardee s franchise system 
as a percentage of revenues from franchised and licensed restaurants  these costs decreased in fiscal and in fiscal  as compared with fiscal and  respectively 
the cost structure associated with the hardee s franchise operations is substantially lower than that associated with the carl s jr 
franchise operations 
while carl s jr 
earns its income from both royalties paid and food purchases by franchisees  hardee s earns substantially all of its franchised restaurant revenue from royalties paid because its franchisees purchase food  supplies and other products from independent vendors and distributors 
advertising expenses 
advertising expenses increased million in fiscal over fiscal  and million in fiscal over fiscal  principally due to increased advertising support for hardee s 
advertising has become increasingly important in the current competitive environment  and  as a result  advertising expenses have increased in terms of dollars spent in fiscal and as compared with the prior fiscal years 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal over fiscal and million to million in fiscal over fiscal general and administrative expenses were  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in fiscal and in terms of dollars spent are primarily the result of the added expense of supporting hardee s restaurant operations 
hardee s general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were approximately for fiscal as compared with for the period of fiscal under our ownership and of hardee s total revenues at the end of calendar year under previous ownership 
general and administrative expenses have also increased in both fiscal and fiscal due to recording incentive compensation accruals for regional restaurant management and selected corporate employees for improved operating performance 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal over fiscal also reflects the economies of scale we are realizing by absorbing certain costs associated with fei into our existing infrastructure 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased million to million as compared with fiscal due to higher levels of borrowings outstanding and the assumption of capital lease obligations as a result of the acquisitions of hardee s in july and fei in april interest expense for fiscal increased million to million as compared with fiscal  primarily as a result of additional borrowings required to complete the hardee s acquisition and the write off of certain loan fees associated with the termination or repayment of our previous credit agreements  partially offset by a reduction in interest rates 
as a result of the refinancing of the term loan under our senior credit facility in march with the proceeds of senior subordinated notes bearing interest at  as well as other changes to our senior credit facility  we expect our overall average interest rate to increase in fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net  mainly consists of interest income  lease income  dividend income  gains and losses on sales of restaurants  income and loss on long term investments  property management expenses and other non recurring income and expenses 
other income expense  net  decreased million in fiscal and increased million in fiscal  as compared with the respective prior fiscal years 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a million charge to our investment in boston west  offset in part by a non recurring gain of million resulting from the disposition of our investment in star buffet 
decreases in lease  dividend and interest income  as well as larger losses recorded from our investment in rally s have also contributed to the overall decrease 
the increase in fiscal generally resulted from interest income earned on our note receivable from checkers and amortization of the related discount along with lease and dividend income recorded from our long term investment in boston west 
extraordinary item during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved the buyback of up to million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
in fiscal  we repurchased million of convertible subordinated notes for million in cash  including accrued interest thereon 
in connection with this repurchase  we recognized an extraordinary gain on the early retirement of debt of million  net of applicable taxes of million 
impact of inflation inflation has an impact on food  construction  occupancy  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect our operations 
historically  we have been able to pass any higher costs due to these inflationary factors along to our customers because those factors have affected nearly all restaurant companies 
during fiscal  and  however  we have emphasized cost controls rather than price increases  given the price competitiveness of the quick service restaurant industry 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonality 
average restaurant sales are normally higher in the summer months than during the winter months for each of our restaurant concepts 
in comparison with our other restaurant concepts  the weather has a greater impact on average restaurant sales at our hardee s restaurants  because a significant number of them are located in rural areas that experience severe winter conditions without the benefit of municipal storm services typical of more urban areas 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased million to million in fiscal in fiscal  we generated cash flows from operating activities of million  compared with million in fiscal this increase was mainly due to the added operations of our hardee s restaurants and increased revenues and improved operating margins at our carl s jr 
and taco bueno restaurants 
investing activities absorbed million of our cash to fund capital additions of million and to complete the acquisition of fei and other hardee s franchised restaurants for million  net of cash acquired 
partially generating some of the funds necessary for these investments were the proceeds of million from the sale of our investment in star buffet  million from the sale of property and equipment to our franchisees  and million from collections on and sale of notes receivable  related party receivables and leases receivable 
financing activities provided us with million in cash  primarily from the net proceeds of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes and additional borrowings under our senior credit facility 
cash flows from operating and financing activities were mainly used to acquire fei and certain other hardee s franchised restaurants  to repay existing indebtedness of million  to fund the remodeling of our hardee s restaurants to the new star hardee s format and convert certain carl s jr 
restaurants to the carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand concepts  to pay million of deferred financing costs associated with our acquisition of fei  to repay million in capital lease obligations and to pay dividends of million 
exercises of stock options and the related tax benefit provided us with an additional million 
on march   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of million  of which million was used to repay outstanding term loan balances under our senior credit facility 
the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes imposes certain restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness  pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  make investments  incur liens on our assets  sell assets other than in the ordinary course of business  and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates 
the senior subordinated notes represent unsecured general obligations subordinate in right of payment to our senior indebtedness  including our senior credit facility 
in connection with our private placement of senior subordinated notes  we also amended and restated our senior credit facility to increase the lenders commitments under our revolving credit facility to million from million 
commitments under the amended senior credit facility will be reduced after two years by at least million each year 
we also increased our letter of credit sub facility to million from million  and changed the maturity date of the senior credit facility to february the term loan component of the senior credit facility was eliminated as a result of these transactions 
additional borrowings under the senior credit facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including permitted investments and acquisitions 
we will be required to repay borrowings under the senior credit facility with the proceeds from certain asset sales unless the net proceeds of such sales are reinvested in our business  the issuance of certain equity securities or the issuance of additional indebtedness 
of the various options we have regarding interest rates  we have selected libor plus a margin  with future margin adjustments dependent on certain financial ratios from time to time 
our senior credit facility contains the following significant covenants restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and incur liens on our assets  subject to specified exceptions  requirements that we satisfy specified financial tests as a precondition to our acquisition of other businesses  and limitations on making capital expenditures and certain restricted payments including dividends and repurchases of stock subject in certain circumstances to specified financial tests 
in addition  we are required to comply with minimum ebitda requirements  minimum interest coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  minimum consolidated tangible net worth requirements and maximum leverage ratios 
as of january   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
on march   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
net proceeds from this offering were million  of which we used million to repay indebtedness under the senior credit facility 
the convertible subordinated notes  which represent unsecured general obligations subordinate in right of payment to our other obligations  including our senior credit facility and our senior subordinated notes  are due in  are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of adjusted for the stock dividend paid on january  and carry a coupon 
the remaining net proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes  together with borrowings under our senior credit facility  were used to fund the acquisition of fei on april  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of january   we have repurchased million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes for million in cash  including accrued interest thereon 
subsequent to fiscal  we repurchased an additional million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes for million in cash  including accrued interest thereon 
the repurchase of the convertible subordinated notes was funded by a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our primary source of liquidity is our revenues from company operated restaurants  which are generated in cash 
future capital needs will arise primarily for the construction of new restaurants  the remodeling of our hardee s restaurants to the star hardee s format  the remodeling of existing taco bueno restaurants  purchases of hardee s franchised restaurants  the conversion of restaurants to the carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand concepts and capital expenditures to be incurred in connection with our integration of hardee s 
in addition  we continue to discuss certain post closing purchase price adjustments arising from the hardee s acquisition with imasco holdings  inc we believe that any payments required or to be received as a result of such purchase price adjustments would not materially affect our financial condition 
in light of the success of the carl s jr 
and taco bueno chains and the progress of the turnaround at hardee s  we have established new goals for our future development 
we intend to open to company operated carl s jr 
restaurants in fiscal  to restaurants in fiscal and restaurants in fiscal taco bueno anticipates opening up to  and new company operated restaurants in fiscal  and  respectively 
we intend to open  and new company operated star hardee s restaurants over the next three fiscal years  respectively 
the quick service restaurant business generally receives simultaneous cash payment for sales 
we presently reinvest the majority of the net cash flow from operations in long term assets  primarily for the remodeling and construction of restaurants 
normal operating expenses for inventories and current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms usually to days 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets 
we believe that cash generated from our various restaurant concept operations  along with cash and cash equivalents on hand as of january  and amounts available under our senior credit facility  will provide the funds necessary to meet all of our capital spending and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
including the effect of the issuance of the senior subordinated notes and related transactions  we had million of borrowings available to us under our senior credit facility at january  if those sources of capital are insufficient to satisfy our capital spending and working capital requirements  or if we determine to make any significant acquisitions of or investments in other businesses  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
in addition  substantially all of the real properties we own and use for our restaurant operations are unencumbered and could be used by us as collateral for additional debt financing or could be sold and subsequently leased back to us 
we have had discussions with respect to such transactions with prospective financing sources from time to time 
we cannot assure you  however  that real estate financing or other financing could be obtained on acceptable terms 
any sales of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
year we are currently working to resolve the potential impact of the yk on the processing of data sensitive information by our computerized information systems 
yk problems are the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  which could result in miscalculations or system failures 
we have investigated the impact of a yk problem on our business  including our operational  information and financial systems 
based on this investigation  we do not expect a yk problem  including the cost of making our computerized information systems yk compliant  to have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in future periods 
however  our inability to resolve all potential yk problems in a timely manner could have a material adverse impact on us 
we have also initiated communications with significant suppliers and vendors on which we rely in an effort to determine the extent to which our business is vulnerable to the failure by these third parties to remediate their yk problems 
while we have not been informed of any material risks associated with a yk problem for these entities  we cannot assure you that the computerized information systems of these third parties will be yk compliant on a timely basis 
the inability of these third parties to remediate their yk problems could have a material adverse impact on us 
we have completed a review of our information systems and are involved in a comprehensive program to upgrade computer systems and applications in connection with our effort to fully integrate our recent restaurant acquisitions 
in conjunction with this computer upgrade process  we believe we will have addressed any potential yk issues 
total expenditures related to the upgrade of the information systems are expected to range from million to million and will be capitalized or expensed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
through january   we have incurred approximately million of expenditures consisting of hardware and software purchases  internal staff costs and outside consulting and other expenditures related to this upgrade process 
these costs are being funded through operating cash flows 
we have developed or are in the process of developing contingency plans to handle our most reasonably likely worst case yk scenarios  which we have not yet identified fully 
we intend to complete our determination of worst case scenarios after we have received and analyzed responses to substantially all of the inquiries we have made of third parties 
following this analysis  which we expect to have completed by july  we intend to develop a timetable for completing our contingency plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our principal exposure to financial market risks is the impact that interest rate changes could have on our million senior credit facility  of which million remained outstanding as of january  borrowings under our senior credit facility bear interest at the prime rate or at libor plus an applicable margin based on certain financial ratios averaging in fiscal 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of approximately million in annual pre tax earnings 
the estimated reduction is based upon the outstanding balance of our senior credit facility  and  except for the repayment of million in march with the proceeds of our fixed rate senior subordinated notes  assumes no change in the volume  index or composition of debt at january  substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have never had a significant impact on us and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
typically we use these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices could result in lower restaurant level operating margins for our restaurant concepts
