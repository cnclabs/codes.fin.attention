historically  a majority of the company s revenues have been recognized using the percentage of completion method  which requires revenues to be recorded over the term of a client contract based on the percentage of work performed 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of the percentage of work completed is reflected in the fiscal quarter in which the revision becomes known 
the company s operating results may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates of contract completion costs 
although the company from time to time is required to make revisions to its work completion estimates  to date  none of these revisions has had a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
inaccuracies in future work completion estimates could result in a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
losses expected to be incurred on projects in progress are recognized when known 
revenues related to time and materials engagements are recognized when services are performed 
a major portion of the company s services are provided on a fixed price basis and  therefore  the company bears the risk of cost overruns 
client project margins and personnel utilization are critical components of the company s financial performance 
the company regularly reviews staff compensation and overhead costs to ensure that its services are properly priced 
in addition  management monitors the progress of client projects on a monthly basis 
the company attempts to manage its personnel utilization rates by closely monitoring project timetables and staffing requirements for new projects 
because the company s client engagements are generally terminable without substantial client penalty  an unanticipated termination of a client project could require the company to maintain or terminate under utilized employees  resulting in a higher than expected number of unassigned persons or higher severance expenses 
while the level of professional staff may be adjusted to reflect active projects  the company must maintain a sufficient number of senior professionals to oversee existing client projects and participate with the company s sales force in securing new client assignments

despite the increased days sales outstanding in  the company s cash equivalent and short term investment balances increased to million at december   from million at december  net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million in from million for the comparable period in this increase is primarily the result of increases in net income  depreciation and amortization  and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options plus decreases in the growth of accounts receivable  which were partially offset by an increase in other assets  a decrease in accounts payable  and decreases in the growth of accrued expenses and prepaid expenses and other current assets

this approximately  square foot building  which is located in cambridge  massachusetts  will house the company s northeast operations  new employee training facility  and corporate departments 
the lease agreement is for a ten year period  which is expected to commence in june the company s current facility in cambridge  massachusetts  which houses part of the company s northeast operations and corporate functions  is expected to be subleased to a third party through its remaining lease term 
the company s lease at its allston  massachusetts facility  which houses the remainder of the company s northeast operations will be terminated effective june  the company expects that cash flows from operations will provide the principal source of future liquidity for the company

the company currently anticipates that existing cash and investment balances combined with cash generated from operations and amounts available under the facility will be sufficient  at least through  to meet the company s working capital requirements and to fund the expansion of the company s business 
in order to meet client demand for the company s services in  the company expects to continue to increase its professional staff and to open additional sales and operations offices in north america and internationally 
the company plans to open offices and hire personnel in anticipation of increased demand for the company s services 
operating results and liquidity may be adversely affected if market demand and revenues do not increase as anticipated 
as the company expands its international operations  a number of factors  including market acceptance of the company s services  significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and changes in general economic  political  or regulatory conditions could also adversely affect future results and liquidity 
year readiness disclosure the year issue results from computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s internal computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has conducted an assessment of its information technology it systems and non it systems such as building security  voice mail  telephone and other systems containing embedded microprocessors and is in the process of upgrading and enhancing material internal systems to bring them into material year compliance 
these activities are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company s material internal it systems consist principally of accounting  human resources and sales force automation application software created by third parties  plus internally developed time and expense reporting and project accounting software applications 
for the third party software applications  the company has obtained written confirmation that the software applications are year compliant 
the company also expects that each of these third party applications will be upgraded  as well as tested by the company for year compliance by the end of the second quarter of the company believes that its internally developed applications are now materially year compliant 
the company s computer hardware platforms  principally servers  have been confirmed as year compliant by the server manufacturers  and this has been supported by the company s internal testing 
based on currently available information  the company believes the expense associated with these efforts will be immaterial and has provided for the enhancement of these systems in its operating and capital budgets for the current fiscal year 
however  if compliance efforts of which the company is not currently aware are required and are not completed on time  or if the cost of any required updating  modification or replacement of the company s it systems exceeds the company s estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition to the company s internal systems  the company relies on third party relationships in the conduct of its business 
for example  third party vendors handle the payroll function for the company  and the company also relies on the services of landlords of its facilities  telecommunication companies  banks  utilities  and commercial airlines  among others 
the company is currently obtaining assurances from its landlords and material vendors and suppliers that there will be no interruption of service as a result of the year issue  and to the extent such assurances are not given  the company intends to devise contingency plans to ameliorate the negative effects on the company in the event the year issue results in the unavailability of services 
however  contingency plans developed by the company may not prevent a service interruption on the part of one or more of the company s third party vendors or suppliers from having a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the failure on the part of the accounting systems of the company s clients due to the year issue could result in a delay in the payment of invoices issued by the company for services and expenses 
a failure of the accounting systems of a significant number of the company s clients would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is preparing written contingency plans to address failures in its major it and non it systems 
these plans will include identification of major systems  dependencies on third parties  and resources and strategies necessary to restore operations or work around failures 
the failure of the company s accounting systems resulting from a year related power system outage at the company s central data center  particularly at the end of a fiscal period  could represent a reasonably likely worst case scenario 
the company s contingency plan provides for back up power systems that could support the data center  as well as the operation of a parallel third party disaster recovery site 
although the company s principal service offerings do not include year remediation services  former  present and future clients could assert that certain services performed by the company involved or are related to the year issue 
the company has recommended  implemented  and customized various third party software packages for its clients  certain of which may not be year compliant 
because the company has designed  developed and implemented software and systems for a large number of clients since  there can be no way of assuring that all such software programs and systems will be year compliant 
in particular  the company s solution delivery methodology  in many cases  empowers clients to maintain  alter and upgrade systems after the completion of an engagement 
due to the potential significance of the year issue upon client operations  upon any failure of critical client systems or processes that may be directly or indirectly connected or related to systems or software analyzed  designed  developed  or implemented by the company  the company may be subjected to claims regardless of whether the failure is related to the services provided by the company 
if asserted  the resolution of such claims and the associated defense costs could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s policy has been to attempt to include provisions in client contracts that  among other things  disclaim implied warranties  limit the duration of express warranties  limit the company s liability to the amount of fees paid by the client to the company in connection with the project  and disclaim any liability arising from third party software that is implemented  customized or installed by the company 
the company may not be able to obtain these contractual protections in agreements concerning future projects  and contractual provisions governing current and completed projects may not prevent clients from asserting claims against the company with respect to the year issue 
the contractual protections  if any  obtained by the company may not effectively operate to protect the company from  or limit the amount of  any liability arising from claims asserted against the company

these forward looking statements are subject to several risks and uncertainties 
while it is impossible to identify each factor and event that could affect the company s results  there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements and that could have an impact on the company s operating results 
these factors include  without limitation  the number and significance of client engagements commenced and completed during a period  the number of working days in a period  employee hiring  retention  and utilization rates  the company s ability to manage its growth  the company s ability to manage the cost of its engagements  changes in demand for the company s services  changes in demand for third party products or solutions for which the company performs integration services  risks associated with the company s realignment of its north american operations from a geographic based to a service line model  including the orientation of new management teams within the service line structure and the need to develop reliable forecasting tools for each service line within the organization  the year issue  including the effect of the year issue on client purchasing patterns  competition  risks associated with international operations  the acceptance and profitability of the company s services in new locations  the integration of acquired businesses  unanticipated negative outcomes of litigation involving the company  and misappropriation of  or lack or loss of protection of  the company s intellectual property 
the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because the company s sales cycle is relatively long in the case of new clients and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of client assignments and general economic conditions 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  particularly at or near the end of any quarter  can cause significant variations in operating results from period to period
