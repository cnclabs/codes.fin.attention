year issues the year presents potential concerns for business and consumer computing 
the consequences of this issue may include systems failures and business process interruption 
it may also include additional business and competitive differentiation 
if the company  its significant customers  or suppliers fail to make necessary modifications and conversions on a timely basis  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
there are two other related issues which could also lead to incorrect calculations or failures i some systems programming assigns special meaning to certain dates  such as  and ii the year is a leap year 
to address these year issues with its internal systems  including information technology it and non it systems  the company initiated a program designed to deal with the most critical systems  packaged software applications  first 
year compliance testing is complete for the company s internal software systems 
testing of the internal hardware systems for year compliance was begun in the first quarter of  and the company expects the testing to be complete by june  in addition  the company began work on various types of contingency planning to address potential problem areas with internal systems in the first quarter of the company expects the contingency planning to be complete by june  as well 
although the assessment is still underway  management currently believes that all material systems will be compliant by the year and that the cost to address the issues will not be more than  in total 
however  this estimate does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims or the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
the total cost estimate is based on the current assessment of the projects and is subject to change as the projects progress 
the costs incurred to date related to these programs are minimal 
the company has also initiated formal communications with its significant vendors  mainly of it packaged applications  to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remedy their own year issues 
the company has received written assurances of year compliance from all significant vendors 
most of the vendors under existing contracts with the company are under no contractual obligation to provide such information to the company 
the company is taking steps with respect to new vendor agreements to ensure that the vendors products and internal systems are year compliant 
the company does not believe it has any mission critical suppliers of products or services 
the company also assesses the capability of its products to handle the year to assist customers in evaluating their year issues  the company has a description on its website which indicates the capability of segue s products to handle the year all segue products are year compliant 
however  the assessment of whether a complete system will operate correctly depends on the bios capability and software design and integration  and for many end users this will include bios and software provided by companies other than segue 
the company anticipates that substantial litigation may be brought against vendors  including the company  of all component products of systems that are unable to properly manage data related to year the company s agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s liability for such claims 
it is possible  however  that these measures will not provide protection from liability claims  as a result of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
any such claims  with or without merit  could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  including increased warranty costs  customer satisfaction issues and potential lawsuits 
based on currently available information  management does not believe that the year matters discussed above related to internal systems or products sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operations  however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier or another third party would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
certain factors affecting future operating results statements made or incorporated in this form k include a number of forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements include  without limitation  statements containing the words anticipates  believes  expects  intends  future and words of similar import which express management s belief  expectations or intentions regarding the company s future performance 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
certain factors that might cause such a difference are discussed below 
the company s quarterly results may fluctuate 
segue s quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if segue s quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of its common stock could fall substantially 
the company s quarterly revenue may fluctuate significantly for several reasons  including the timing of introductions of new products or product enhancements by segue or its competitors  personnel changes  the size and timing of individual orders  software bugs or other product quality problems  competition and pricing  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products or product enhancements  demand for segue s products is difficult to predict for reasons discussed below  changes in operating expenses  product mix  and general economic conditions 
a substantial portion of the company s operating expenses are related to personnel  facilities and marketing programs 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is based  in significant part  on expectations of future revenues 
if actual revenue levels are below management s expectations  results of operations are likely to be adversely affected 
in addition  the company does not typically experience order backlog 
furthermore  the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of a quarter  with these revenues frequently concentrated in the last weeks or days of a quarter 
as a result  product revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the latter part of that quarter  and revenues for any future quarter are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
for these reasons  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company may not be profitable in the future 
since segue began operations  it has generally experienced losses 
losses have resulted in an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  segue had net income of  in  a net loss of million in  which includes a charge of million for purchased research and development in process and  for severance charges and a net loss of million in  which includes a charge of million related to the eventus and b w acquisitions and a charge of  related to the write offs of an nre fee and guaranteed royalties 
while the company has experienced revenue growth in recent periods  continued growth at the same rate is not sustainable and is not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
failure to sustain or increase profitability may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has recently shifted its focus from general software testing to e business testing 
in  the company began to develop and acquire technology to provide automated software testing for web enabled software applications  including its acquisition of sqlbench in december these developments allowed the company to extend its testing capabilities beyond distributed client server applications with gui front ends 
because e business scenario testing is more complicated than general software testing  the company may experience issues with its product quality 
in the second quarter of  segue introduced livequality  an e business scenario testing solution 
in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired eventus software  inc and black white software  inc  which provided the company with other technologies to expand its current line of e business testing products 
the company s shift from a general software testing company to an e business testing company during the past year has resulted in significant changes in i segue s organizational structure  ii management personnel  iii product mix  and iv sales approach 
if the company fails to effectively manage these changes  or make other changes which may be needed in connection with such shift to an e business testing company  the company s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
the development of a market for the company s products is uncertain 
the market for automated software testing products is relatively new and undeveloped 
marketing and sales techniques in the automated software testing marketplace  as well as the bases for competition  are not well established 
there can be no assurance as to the extent that a significant market for automated software testing products will develop or the extent to which the company s products will be accepted in that market 
although the company believes that the current trend toward increased use of automated software testing will continue  a majority of software testing is still carried out manually  and there can be no assurance that the automated software testing market will enjoy continued growth 
the commercial market for products and services designed for use on the internet  intranet and extranet has only recently begun to develop 
the success of the company s products focused on e commerce and internet applications will depend on the growth of the market and on the company s ability to continue to enhance its products to work with all of the prevalent technologies driving internet applications 
there can be no assurance that segue will be able to effectively adapt its products to the prevalent technologies being used on e commerce applications or to successfully compete in the market for internet related products and services 
as is typical for new and rapidly evolving industries  demand for recently introduced products is highly uncertain 
the company may have difficulty managing its growth 
the company has been experiencing a period of rapid growth  including increases in the number of orders  customers and employees 
the company s rapid growth has placed  and may continue to place  strains on its management  operations and systems 
to manage future growth effectively  segue must expand  improve and effectively utilize its operational  management  marketing  sales and financial systems as necessitated by changes in its business 
the company is implementing an erp information system and opening a technical support center in ireland in  both of which could be disruptive 
additionally  as part in the restructuring plan in the first quarter of  the company has significantly changed the sales management team and consolidated the position of senior vice president of research and development with the position of senior vice president and general manager of the executive management team 
in conjunction with these management changes  the company also changed the structure of its internal organization by adding product divisions which relate to its e business testing products 
the company also refocused its sales and marketing approach to focus on e commerce applications 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage such changes and such changes are likely to be disruptive 
the company may be subject to risks associated with its recent acquisitions and future acquisitions 
in the fourth quarter of  segue acquired eventus software  inc and black white software  inc 
in two separate transactions 
the company s product range and customer base have increased in the recent past due in part to these acquisitions 
these acquisitions provided the company with technologies to expand its current line of e business testing products 
there can be no assurance that the integration of all of the acquired technologies will be successful or will not result in unforeseen difficulties which may absorb significant management attention 
in the future  the company may acquire additional businesses or product lines 
the recently completed acquisitions  or any future acquisition  may not produce the revenue  earnings or business synergies that it anticipated  and an acquired product  service or technology might not perform as expected 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if such benefits can actually be realized 
the process of integrating acquired companies into the company s business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention  which the company might otherwise devote to its existing business 
also  the process may require significant financial resources that the company might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of its existing operations 
the integration of the acquisitions of eventus software  inc and black white software  inc 
will take longer than originally expected 
if the company pursues a future acquisition  its management could spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the acquisition 
to pay for a future acquisition  the company might use capital stock or cash 
alternatively  segue might borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if the company uses capital stock as it did with its recent acquisitions  the company s stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests 
if the company uses cash or debt financing  its financial liquidity will be reduced 
the company has recently changed its sales approach and restructured its sales teams 
as part of the shift in the company s business to e business testing  the company has recently begun to focus its marketing and sales efforts with a solution sales approach 
the company s direct sales force focuses on large enterprise and strategic sales in an effort to provide as many solutions as a particular client needs 
to faciliate the solution sales approach  the company restructured its direct sales force into teams of one strategic sales representative and one technical support engineer 
the company has also recently hired additional sales personnel and worked to integrate sales personnel from eventus and black white 
there can be no assurance that this sales approach will result in greater revenues 
because the company s sales force focuses on making larger sales  its sales cycle may increase 
larger purchases will take longer than smaller sales because customers will generally take more time to decide on whether to make larger purchases 
a longer sales cycle reduces the company s ability to forecast revenue levels 
any delay or loss in sales of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition  and could cause its operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company s performance will depend in part on the growth and commercial acceptance of the internet 
the company s future success will depend substantially upon the widespread adoption of the internet as a primary medium for commerce and business applications 
if the internet does not become a viable and substantial commercial medium  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant user and traffic growth  which has  at times  caused user frustration with slow access and download times 
the internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by continued growth 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  such as security  reliability  cost  accessibility and quality of service  remain unresolved and may negatively affect the growth of internet use or the attractiveness of commerce and business communication on the internet 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased activity or due to increased government regulation and taxation of internet commerce 
the company faces significant competition from other software companies 
the market for software quality management tools is new  intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
the company expects competition to intensify in the future 
the company currently encounters competition from a number of public and private companies including mercury interactive corporation  rational software corporation and compuware corporation 
many of segue s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than it does and  therefore  may be able to respond more quickly than the company to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than the company 
the company may also face increased competition from the recent consolidation of several companies in the automated software quality market 
an increase in competition could result in price reductions and loss of market share 
such competition and any resulting reduction in profitability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s business could be adversely affected if its products contain errors 
software products as complex as the company s products may contain undetected errors or bugs  which result in product failures 
the occurrence of errors could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to the company s reputation  or damage to its efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance existing products and develop new products 
to be competitive  the company must develop and introduce product enhancements and new products that which increase its customers ability to test their systems 
if the company fails to develop and introduce new products and enhancements successfully and on a timely basis  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the emerging nature of the automated software testing and e commerce testing markets requires that segue continually improve the performance  features and reliability of its products  particularly in response to competitive offerings and evolving customer needs 
the company must also introduce enhancements to existing products as quickly as possible and prior to the introduction of competing products 
the company has acquired  and may in the future acquire  technologies to provide it with the tools to introduce new products or to enhance current products 
the success of such acquisitions will depend in part on the company s ability to effectively integrate the technologies 
the company must hire and retain skilled personnel in a tight labor market 
qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
the company s success depends in large part upon its ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales and marketing personnel  software engineers and other senior personnel 
there is intense competition for sales personnel in the company s business  and there can be no assurance that segue will be successful in attracting  integrating  motivating and retaining new sales personnel 
the failure of the company to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel that are integral to its direct sales  product development  service and support teams may limit the rate at which the company can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company faces many risks associated with international business activities 
the company derived approximately of its total product sales from international customers in the international market for software products is highly competitive and the company expects to face substantial competition in this market from established and emerging companies 
segue faces many risks associated with international business activities including currency fluctuations  imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  tailoring of products to local requirements  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations 
to the extent that the company is unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
the company may be affected by unexpected year problems 
many existing computer systems and software products do not properly recognize dates after december  this year problem could result in miscalculations  data corruption  system failures or disruptions of operations 
the company is subject to potential year problems affecting its products  its internal systems and the systems of its vendors and distributors  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that year errors or defects will not be discovered in the company s internal software systems and  if such errors or defects are discovered  there can be no assurance that the costs of making such systems year compliant will not be material 
year errors or defects in the internal systems maintained by the company s vendors or distributors could require segue to incur significant unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems or replace affected vendors and could reduce the company s revenue from its indirect distribution channel 
the company may be subject to risks associated with its channel partner program 
although the company has not historically sold significant amounts of its products through indirect channels  the company intends to continue to develop channel sales as part of its business strategy 
recently segue has added significant resources to expand its channel sales  including dedicating sales personnel to increase sales through current channel partners and developing relationships with other potential channel partners 
there can be no assurance that the company s greater efforts will result in an increase in revenues 
furthermore  the company may be subject to certain distinct risks associated with channel sales 
the company licenses its products to channel partners at a discount and such partners re license the products to end users 
the company s agreements with its channel partners are non exclusive and provide the channel partners with day price protection 
because the company s channel partners generally order products after they have received purchase orders  there is no requirement that the company repurchase any product 
the company typically does not grant its channel partners a contractual right to return software products 
when approved by management  however  the company has accepted returns of certain software products and has provided an allowance for the specified products 
segue selects its channel partners based on the partner s financial viability  product expertise and market focus 
in order for the company s strategy to broaden market penetration through its channel partner program to be successful  the company must increase its unit sales to offset the discount the company is providing to its channel partners 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in the development of these channels 
moreover  selling through indirect channels may limit the company s contact with the end users of its products 
as a result  the company s ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered and its ability to develop and maintain customer goodwill may be limited 
furthermore  the company s existing or future channel partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
in addition  segue will need to resolve potential conflicts among its sales force and channel partners 
the company could be subject to product liability claims 
in selling its products  the company relies primarily on shrink wrap licenses that contain  among other things  provisions protecting against the unauthorized use  copying and transfer of the licensed program and limiting the company s exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  these licenses are not signed by the licensees and the provisions of these licenses  including the provisions limiting the company s exposure to product liability claims  may therefore be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
the company s products may be used on applications that are critical to the operations of its customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s application could result in a claim for substantial damages against the company  regardless of the company s responsibility for such failure 
although the company maintains general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
the company s success depends on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company s success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of its software and other proprietary technology 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of the company s proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from the company s technology without paying segue for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
although the company has taken steps to protect its proprietary technology  they may be inadequate 
the company currently relies on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights in its products 
the company presently has no registered copyrights 
the company has a patent but there can be no assurance that the patent would be upheld if challenged 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which the company markets its products may afford little or no effective protection of the company s intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technology 
if the company resorts to legal proceedings to enforce its intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert intellectual property infringement claims against the company 
if the company were to discover that any of its products violated third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms to continue offering the product without substantial reengineering or that any effort to undertake such reengineering would be successful 
any claim of infringement could cause the company to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract management from the company s business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires the company to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent the company from selling its products 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition
