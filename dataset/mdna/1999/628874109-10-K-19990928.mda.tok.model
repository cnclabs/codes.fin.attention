the adverse impact of the implementation of the medicare prospective payment system pps under the balanced budget act of  for medicare residents of skilled nursing facilities was significantly greater than anticipated 
pps has created numerous changes to reimbursement policies applicable to skilled nursing under medicare part a 
prior to pps  medicare reimbursed each skilled nursing facility based on that facility s actual medicare part a costs plus a premium 
under pps  medicare pays skilled nursing facilities a fixed fee per medicare part a patient day based on the acuity level of the patient 
the per diem rate covers all items and services furnished during a covered stay for which reimbursement was formerly made separately under medicare 
consequently  the company has experienced revenue pressure as a result of nursing facilities attempting to manage pharmaceutical costs along with all other costs associated with patient care under a simple per diem reimbursement amount 
in addition  there has been a reduction in utilization of other therapies such as speech  occupational and physical rehabilitation 
additionally  as a result of these changes  skilled nursing facilities have become increasingly more reluctant to admit medicare residents  especially those requiring complex care  causing medicare census in these facilities to weaken and a reduction in the average length of stay for medicare residents 
these factors have had the effect of significantly reducing overall occupancy in the facilities served by the company 
the resident acuity level has also decreased as these facilities have attempted to avoid high acuity patients negatively impacting overall utilization of drugs  particularly those with higher cost such as infusion therapy 
for medicare certified skilled nursing facilities with a high cost structure  or those which are unable to cut costs  pps has caused significant earnings and cash pressure 
some facilities have sought consolidation as a method of reducing costs and increasing efficiencies causing the company to experience some bed loss 
these outcomes have negatively impacted nursing facilities and the institutional pharmacy services industry as a whole 
although there may be some legislative relief for the company s customers  management is positioning the company to succeed in the current pps environment by adjusting its cost structure appropriately 
the company is rapidly reducing operating and overhead costs and accelerating the implementation of the hub and spoke fulfillment and delivery model 
savings are expected to exceed million on an annualized basis  once implemented 
during the fourth quarter of the company recorded special and nonrecurring charges of million before tax million net of tax 
a special charge of million before tax was recorded to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts  and nonrecurring charges of million before tax were recorded in connection with the implementation and execution of strategic restructuring and consolidation initiatives of certain operations and other nonrecurring items 
the special charge to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts resulted from significant changes observed in industry and customer trends during the last three months of the fiscal year ended june   and items encountered from recent acquisitions 
the circumstances of the customer and industry trends primarily relate to increased bankruptcies and significant financial difficulties recently experienced by the company s customers primarily as a result of the implementation of the medicare prospective payment system million pre tax charge  as described below 
the acquisition related items pertain to specific receivable collectibility issues related to acquired operating systems  and other nonrecurring issues which have resulted in potentially uncollectible receivables million and million pre tax charges  respectively  as described below 
accounts receivable collection and allowance adequacy is a continuous focus of management 
bad debt provisions and allowances are continually monitored and evaluated based on historical experience and projected future trends 
until several months ago bad debt experience rates had remained relatively consistent and the recorded provisions reflected this experience 
however  during the last three months of the fiscal year ended june   these same processes and procedures identified trends indicating a significant change in the financial viability in many of the company s customers and accordingly an increase in the amount of potentially uncollectible accounts 
the negative trends in the financial viability of the company s customers attributed primarily to a greater than expected adverse impact of the implementation of pps 
pps became effective for skilled nursing facilities on july  pps implementation coincides with each facility s cost reporting period fiscal year beginning after june  since a majority of these facilities report on a december year end  most facilities were reimbursed under the pps provisions beginning january  the negative impact of pps reimbursement on the financial health of long term care facilities became evident during the last three months of the fiscal year ended june  with a significant increase in the number of customers declaring bankruptcy or liquidating assets as compared to historical trends 
as a result of these recent negative trends  a before tax increase of million in the allowance for doubtful accounts was required as of june  management has reviewed the company s credit and collection processes  enhancing the policies and procedures where necessary  in order to identify and mitigate future collection issues under the pps reimbursement system 
one of the company s primary initiatives has been to integrate its pharmacy operations under one common operating system  ncs concord dx system 
at june   approximately of the pharmacy sites have been successfully converted to ncs concord dx system 
prior to conversion to concord dx  acquired pharmacies continued to use their historical operating and billing systems 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company accelerated its focus on conversion of all historical billing and operating systems to concord dx 
as part of the conversion process  receivables billed under historical systems were intensely scrutinized and any collectibility risk was further assessed at the time of conversion 
accordingly  an million pretax increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts was recorded to allow for potentially uncollectible accounts under historical systems 
the company recorded additional special charges to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts for numerous smaller items aggregating million before taxes 
these special charge items primarily include uncollectible accounts receivable acquired in business combinations in excess of allowances established at time of acquisition  and uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from system conversion and transitions to new service provider numbers subsequent to acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company adopted a new plan of restructuring to consolidate certain pharmacy sites in similar geographies 
the plan is a continuation of the plan adopted in fiscal to combine pharmacies in close proximity in order to improve operating efficiencies 
as a result of the new exit plan  additional pharmacy sites will be consolidated into either a new or existing location 
during the year ended june   the company recorded nonrecurring charges of million related to the new site consolidations and additional costs incurred on the site consolidations announced in the prior year 
these costs consist of million related to employee severance and other compensation related expenses  million related to lease termination costs and million related to asset impairments and other miscellaneous costs 
as of june   three site consolidations had been completed with the remainder expected to be completed by the end of fiscal the remaining million of the nonrecurring charge primarily relates to severance incurred during the fourth quarter associated with the company s expense reduction initiatives  additional acquisition related and other miscellaneous expenses

the company had net interest expense of million for the year ended june   compared to net interest income of million during the year ended june  the increase in expense is due to increased borrowings on the line of credit and the issuance of million of convertible subordinated debentures in august these funds were used primarily for acquisitions 
the net interest income position in fiscal is primarily attributable to the reduction of long term debt with funds from the company s initial public offering completed on february  and interest income earned on funds from a secondary public offering completed by the company on october  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash used in operating activities increased in fiscal due to increases in trade accounts receivable  other current assets and inventories 
the growth in accounts receivable and inventory are primarily associated with internal sales growth 
additionally  some accounts receivable growth is attributable to slower payment trends by customers as a result of pps implementation and other accounts receivable issues previously described above 
the increase in other current assets primarily results from income tax refunds receivable at june  these cash flow decreases were partially offset by increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 
a majority of the trade accounts payable increase is attributable to longer negotiated payment terms under a new primary pharmaceutical supplier agreement implemented in june cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories primarily associated with internal sales growth 
these cash flow decreases were partially offset by increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities decreased from million in fiscal and million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of fewer business acquisitions during as compared to the two previous years 
the decrease is partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures 
the company made capital expenditures of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal significant capital expenditures during the year ended june  primarily included computer and information systems equipment and computer software as the company continued to invest in converting all sites to the concord dx system 
at june  a majority of the company s sites had been converted

significant capital expenditures during the year ended june  included computer and information systems equipment  computer software  furniture and fixtures at new facilities in pinellas park  florida and van nuys  california  leasehold improvements  medication carts and delivery vehicles 
net cash provided by financing activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and then decreased to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily the result of funds received from an offering of convertible subordinated debentures completed by the company on august  and an increase in funds borrowed under the revolving credit facility 
these funds were primarily utilized for acquisitions in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal primarily results from reduced financing needs resulting from a significant reduction in acquisition activity during the net proceeds during were primarily obtained from the revolving credit agreement to fund working capital needs resulting from internal growth and infrastructure investments in a common operating system 
use of the revolving credit agreement slowed to a net increase of million during the fourth quarter of as a result of reduced operating and overhead costs from strategic initiatives  more favorable payment terms with the company s new primary pharmaceutical supplier and lower infrastructure investments in the conversion to a common operating system 
in august  the company issued million of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures carry an interest rate of 
the debentures are obligations of the company 
the operations of the company are currently conducted principally through subsidiaries  which are separate and distinct legal entities 
the company s ability to make payments of principal and interest on the debentures will depend on its ability to receive distributions of cash from its subsidiaries 
each of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries has guaranteed the company s payment obligations under the debentures  so long as such subsidiary is a member of an affiliated group within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code of  as amended which includes the company 
the satisfaction by the company s subsidiaries of their contractual guarantees  as well as the payment of dividends and certain loans and advances to the company by such subsidiaries  may be subject to certain statutory or contractual restrictions  are contingent upon the earnings of such subsidiaries and are subject to various business considerations 
the company expects to meet future financing needs principally through the use of its revolving credit facility 
in june  the company entered into a four year  million revolving credit facility the credit facility with a bank  which replaced the existing million revolving agreement 
under the credit facility  the company also has available a million swing line revolving facility the swing line 
also in june  the company entered into a million bridge facility agreement the bridge facility due december  effective july   the credit facility was amended increasing the total commitment from million to million and was syndicated to a consortium of banks 
also effective july  the bridge facility was paid with funds under the amended credit facility and was terminated 
effective august   the credit facility was amended to reduce the available commitment from million to million  provide all of the company assets as security  limit the availability of the facility to use for working capital only  require lender approval on future acquisitions  and modify covenants and the variable interest rate basis 
the amended credit facility bears interest at a variable rate based upon the eurodollar rate plus a spread of to basis points  dependent upon the company s ratio of total funded debt to ebitda 
the company believes that its cash and available sources of capital  including funds available under its revolving credit facility  are sufficient to meet its normal operating requirements 
the company s effective income tax expense benefit rates were  and for the years ended june   and  respectively 
the tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of state and local income taxes and the non deductibility of certain acquisition costs 
as discussed under the caption  business governmental regulation  the company s facility in indianapolis  indiana has been the subject of an investigation by federal authorities  and the company has engaged in discussions with representatives of the us attorney s office in indianapolis concerning the settlement of alleged violations of federal law at that facility 
company s herrin  illinois facility is also under investigation by federal and state authorities 
it is possible that the imposition of significant fines or other remedies in connection with the resolution of either of these matters could have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
year readiness disclosure computer systems in use after the beginning of the year will need to accept four digit entries in the date code field in order to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
consequently  many companies face significant uncertainties because of the need to upgrade or replace their currently installed computer systems to comply with such year requirements 
various systems could be affected ranging from complex information technology it computer systems to non it devices  such as an individual machine s programmable logic controller 
the company has reviewed all significant current and planned internal it systems and believes these systems are year compliant 
however  there can be no assurance that coding errors or other defects will not be discovered in the future 
the company is currently in the process of reviewing and assessing all significant non it devices for year compliance 
the company expects to complete the process for review and assessment  device testing and resolution of noncompliance issues  if any  by november  the company is currently determining the extent to which it may be impacted by any third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company is assessing and reviewing relationships with all significant customers  suppliers  payors and other third parties to determine the extent  if any  to which the company could be impacted by those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
the company expects to complete this review and assessment by november  at this stage of the review no assurance can be given that the failure by one or more third parties to become year compliant will not have a material adverse impact on its operations 
the company intends to develop contingency plans for significant third parties determined to be at high risk of noncompliance or business disruption before october  the contingency plans will be developed on a case by case basis 
judgments regarding contingency plans are themselves subject to many variables and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that the company will correctly anticipate the level  impact or duration of noncompliance by third parties  or that its contingency plan will be sufficient to mitigate the impact 
management of the company believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
nevertheless  since it is not possible to anticipate all future outcomes  especially when third parties are involved  there could be circumstances in which the company s operations could be interrupted 
if the federal and state healthcare reimbursement agencies or their intermediaries fail to implement year compliant technologies before december   a significant cash flow problem may result 
these agencies and intermediaries have year plans in place and we continue to monitor the status of these projects 
all of these government agencies have stated that interim procedures would be implemented if their year solutions are not in place by january  in addition  disruptions in the economy in general resulting from year issues could also adversely impact the company 
the majority of future costs related to year readiness issues will be expensed as incurred and are expected to be funded through operating cash flows 
through the year ended june  costs related to the year issue have been immaterial to the financial results of the company 
future costs related to year issues are also expected to be immaterial to the financial results of the company 
estimates of costs are based on currently available information and developments may occur that could increase the costs related to year issues
