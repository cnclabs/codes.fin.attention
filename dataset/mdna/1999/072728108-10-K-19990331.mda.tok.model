item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview baycorp s principal asset is its equity interest in great bay 
great bay is an electric generating company whose principal asset is a joint ownership interest in the seabrook nuclear power project in seabrook  new hampshire 
unless the context requires otherwise  references to baycorp for events and time periods before january reflect treatment of baycorp as successor to great bay 
baycorp reported net losses for the years ended december  and december  and reported net income for the year ended december  the net loss was primarily due to unscheduled outages at the seabrook project that occurred during the year and to the charge related to the termination of a power marketing agreement between great bay and peco 
see business recent developments 
the net loss was primarily due to scheduled and unscheduled outages at the seabrook project that occurred during that year 
the net income was primarily due to a gain of  from the sale of unused steam generators from seabrook unit the seabrook project from time to time experiences both scheduled and unscheduled outages 
great bay incurs losses during outage periods due to the loss of all operating revenues and additional costs associated with the outages as well as continuing operating and maintenance expenses and depreciation 
unscheduled outages or operation of the unit at reduced capacity can occur due to the automatic operation of safety systems following the detection of a malfunction 
in addition  it is possible for the unit to be shut down or operated at reduced capacity based on the results of scheduled and unscheduled inspections and routine surveillance by seabrook project personnel 
it is not possible for great bay to predict the frequency or duration of any future unscheduled outages  however  it is likely that such unscheduled outages will occur 
the seabrook project began a scheduled refueling outage on march  refueling outages are generally scheduled every months depending upon the seabrook project capacity factor and the rate at which the nuclear fuel is consumed 
on february   great bay filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on november  the confirmation date  a formal confirmation order by the bankruptcy court with respect to great bay s amended bankruptcy plan became effective 
at that time  great bay emerged from bankruptcy 
as a result of the chapter proceeding and in accordance with the provisions of the amended bankruptcy plan  the capital structure of great bay was completely changed 
in particular  as part of its chapter proceeding  great bay discharged all of its pre petition debt  which consisted primarily of the approximately million principal amount of outstanding notes and unpaid accrued interest on the notes of approximately million  and raised gross proceeds of million in the amended bankruptcy plan 
see business bankruptcy proceeding and reorganization 
thus  as a result  great bay s net worth increased significantly and great bay was relieved of the obligation to make principal and interest payments on the notes 
the following discussion focuses solely on operating revenues and operating expenses which are presented in a substantially consistent manner for all of the periods presented 
as a result of the chapter proceeding and subsequent effectiveness of the amended bankruptcy plan on november   the statement of income represents separately the results of operations of great bay s predecessor company prior to november  from the results of operations of great bay after that date 
on the confirmation date  great bay adopted fresh start accounting  which resulted in adjustments to the assets and liabilities of great bay to their estimated fair values as of the confirmation date and includes the net proceeds of the equity financing for the amended bankruptcy plan  and eliminated liabilities discharged under the amended bankruptcy plan 
results of operations operating revenues baycorp s operating revenues for increased by approximately million  or  to  as compared with  for this increase was primarily due to less scheduled and unscheduled outage time at the seabrook project during during  the capacity factor at the seabrook project was of the rated capacity as compared to a capacity factor of for operating revenues and capacity factor were adversely impacted in by the scheduled refueling outage at the seabrook project that began on may   lasting days  and by the unscheduled outage that began on december   lasting days 
in contrast  there was no refueling outage in  however  the seabrook project had approximately unscheduled outage days in sales of electricity increased by approximately to  kilowatt hours in as compared to  kilowatt hours in operating revenues were favorably affected in by an increase in the sales price per kwh 
during  the sales price per kwh determined by dividing total sales revenue by the total number of kwhs sold in the applicable period increased to cents per kwh as compared with cents per kwh in great bay s cost of power determined by dividing total operating expenses by great bay s share of the power produced by the seabrook project during the applicable period decreased to cents per kwh in as compared to cents per kwh in this decrease was primarily the result of the higher capacity factor at the seabrook project during as compared to scheduled and unscheduled outage time increases great bay s cost of power because seabrook costs are spread over fewer kwhs 
in addition  prices obtained for the company s approximately mw of power not committed under long term contracts increased to cents per kwh from cents per kwh in baycorp s operating revenues for decreased by approximately million  or  to  as compared with  for this decrease was primarily due to the scheduled and unscheduled outages at the seabrook project during during  the capacity factor at the seabrook project was of the rated capacity as compared to a capacity factor of for operating revenues and capacity factor were adversely impacted in by the scheduled refueling outage referred to above 
in contrast  there was only a brief unscheduled outage in january and february of sales of electricity decreased by approximately to  kilowatt hours in as compared to  kilowatt hours in operating revenues were favorably affected in by an increase in the sales price per kwh 
during the sales price per kwh increased to cents per kwh as compared with cents per kwh in great bay s cost of power increased to cents per kwh in as compared to cents per kwh in this increase was primarily the result of the lower capacity factor at the seabrook project due to the scheduled and unscheduled outages in and the associated costs of these outages 
expenses baycorp s total operating expenses excluding depreciation and taxes for increased million  or  in comparison with this increase was primarily the result of the costs associated with the unscheduled outages in  including great bay s purchased power expenses of approximately million that covered firm sales of approximately million during unscheduled outages in as great bay enters into more sales transaction agreements to supply firm power  great bay s expenses to purchase power to cover firm power obligations during unscheduled outages may increase 
purchased power expenses may also increase as great bay may purchase power in the open market to resell to a third party 
operating expenses were also adversely impacted by payments to peco of approximately million in  which included the charge related to the termination of the power marketing agreement with peco for approximately million in june see recent developments 
charges for peco s marketing service in were approximately million 
in addition  depreciation and amortization increased  or 
taxes other than income decreased million  or  in as compared to due to the seabrook project property tax settlement that resulted in a property tax refund to great bay in december of approximately million 
see recent developments 
other income decreased  or  in as compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to interest income  which decreased  or  in as compared to this decrease was attributable to the lower cash balances in as compared to decommissioning cost accretion increased  or  to million in as compared to million in this accretion is a non cash charge that reflects great bay s liability related to the closure and decommissioning of the seabrook project in current year dollars over the licensing period during which the seabrook project is licensed to operate 
decommissioning trust fund income increased  or  to  in as compared to  in the increase in interest earned on the decommissioning trust fund reflected the higher fund balance as great bay continues to make contributions to the decommissioning trust fund 
baycorp s total operating expenses excluding depreciation and taxes for increased million  or  in comparison with this increase was primarily the result of the costs associated with the scheduled refueling outage in that lasted days and the unscheduled outage that began on december  and lasted days 
there was a slight increase in depreciation and amortization and a slight decrease in taxes other than income  from to other income decreased million  or  in as compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to a million gain on the sale in july of four unused steam generators from seabrook unit great bay had previously written off its investment in seabrook unit there were no material sales of unit assets in decommissioning cost accretion increased  to  in as compared to  in  primarily due to the revised decommissioning funding schedule for the seabrook project approved by the new hampshire nuclear decommissioning financing committee on october  the new study increased the present value of total decommissioning costs as of january  and increased the cost escalation rate from to 
decommissioning trust fund income increased  or  to  in as compared to  in  reflecting the higher fund balance as compared to the balance 
net operating losses for federal income tax purposes  as of december   the company had net operating loss carry forwards nols of approximately million  which are scheduled to expire between and because the company has experienced one or more ownership changes  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  an annual limitation is imposed on the ability of the company to use million of these carryforwards 
the company s best estimate at this time is that the annual limitation on the use of million of the company s nols is approximately million per year 
any unused portion of the million annual limitation applicable to the company s restricted nol s is available for use in future years until such nol s are scheduled to expire 
the company s other million of nols are not currently subject to such limitations 
liquidity and capital resources great bay currently sells most of its power in the northeast united states short term wholesale power market 
the cash generated from electricity sales by great bay has been less than the company s ongoing cash requirements 
the company may continue to incur cash deficits 
great bay intends to cover such deficits with its cash and short term investments which totaled approximately million at december  if the seabrook project operates at a capacity factor below historical levels  or if expenses associated with the ownership or operation of the seabrook project  including without limitation decommissioning costs  are materially higher than anticipated  or if the prices at which great bay is able to sell its share of the seabrook project electricity do not increase at the rates and within the time expected by great bay  great bay would be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet its ongoing cash requirements 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that baycorp will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 
baycorp s principal asset available to serve as collateral for borrowings is great bay s interest in the seabrook project 
pursuant to a purchased power agreement  dated as of april   between great bay and unitil power corp  great bay s interest in the seabrook project is encumbered by a mortgage 
this mortgage may be subordinated to up to million of senior secured financing 
see business purchased power agreements 
baycorp s cash and short term investments decreased approximately million during the principal factor affecting liquidity during was the reduced operating income discussed above 
non cash charges to income included million for depreciation  million for nuclear fuel amortization  million for decommissioning trust fund accretion and an increase in miscellaneous current liabilities of million due to the accrual for expenses associated with the scheduled march refueling outage at the seabrook project 
offsetting these non cash charges to income were cash charges including a million increase in december accounts receivable as compared to december accounts receivables 
year end receivables reflected december s capacity factor of as compared to year end receivables that reflected december s capacity factor of 
other cash charges included an increase in prepaids of million primarily due to the timing of seabrook funding and charges of million for great bay s portion of capital expenditures for plant and nuclear fuel 
also in  baycorp purchased  shares of the company s common stock for an aggregate of  or an average of per share 
little bay and montaup are working to obtain required regulatory approvals in connection with little bay s agreement with montaup to purchase montaup s interest in the seabrook project 
if the parties obtain all required regulatory approvals  the parties intend to complete the transaction and little bay would pay approximately million to montaup 
great bay s decommissioning payments totaled approximately million 
the decommissioning funding schedule is determined by the ndfc  which reviews the schedule for the seabrook project at least annually 
great bay expects to use revenues from the sale of power to make these decommissioning payments 
in june  the new hampshire state legislature enacted legislation that provides that in the event of a default by great bay on its payments to the decommissioning fund  the other seabrook joint owners would be obligated to pay their proportional share of such default 
in response to the new hampshire legislation  great bay has agreed to make accelerated payments to the seabrook decommissioning fund such that great bay will have contributed sufficient funds by the year to allow sufficient monies to accumulate  with no further payments by great bay to the fund  to the full estimated amount of great bay s decommissioning obligation by the time the current seabrook operating license expires in as a result of these developments  the nrc staff found that great bay complies with the decommissioning funding assurance requirements 
see business decommissioning 
great bay anticipates that its share of the seabrook project s capital expenditures for the fiscal year will total approximately million for nuclear fuel and various capital projects 
in addition  great bay is required under the joa to pay its share of seabrook unit and seabrook unit expenses  including  without limitation  operation and maintenance expenses  construction and nuclear fuel expenditures and decommissioning costs  regardless of the level of seabrook unit s operations 
seabrook project expenses to preserve and protect unit assets are approximately  per year  of which great bay s share is approximately  per year 
for each of the tax years   and  great bay filed property tax abatement applications with the three new hampshire towns in which the seabrook project is located 
in december  great bay announced that it had reached an agreement with the town of seabrook to settle its outstanding property tax litigation 
as a result of the settlement agreement  great bay received approximately million from the town of seabrook 
in addition  the parties agreed that the assessed value of the seabrook project will be reduced over the five year period of the settlement agreement from billion in to billion in great bay and the other joint owners are currently engaged in settlement negotiations with the towns of hampton and hampton falls

certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the results of baycorp and or great bay to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
ownership of a single asset 
baycorp s principal asset is its equity interest in great bay 
great bay owns a single principal asset  a joint interest in the seabrook nuclear power project in seabrook  new hampshire 
accordingly  baycorp s results of operations are completely dependent upon the successful and continued operation of the seabrook project 
in particular  if the seabrook project experiences unscheduled outages of significant duration  great bay s results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
history of losses 
baycorp has never reported an operating profit for any year since its incorporation 
historically  sales at short term rates have not resulted in sufficient revenue to enable baycorp to meet its cash requirements for operations  maintenance and capital related costs 
there can be no assurance that great bay will be able to sell power at prices that will enable it to meet its cash requirements 
liquidity needs 
as of december   baycorp had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company believes that such cash  together with the anticipated proceeds from the sale of electricity by great bay  will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its cash requirements until the prices at which great bay can sell its electricity increase sufficiently to enable the company to cover its annual cash requirements 
however  if the seabrook project operated at a capacity factor below historical levels  or if expenses associated with the ownership or operation of the seabrook project  including without limitation decommissioning costs  are materially higher than anticipated  or if the prices at which great bay is able to sell its share of the seabrook project electricity do not increase at the rates and within the time expected by great bay  great bay or the company would be required to raise additional capital  either through a debt financing or an equity financing  to meet ongoing cash requirements 
there is no assurance that great bay or the company would be able to raise such capital or that the terms on which any additional capital is available would be acceptable 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to then existing stockholders will result 
changes in the new england wholesale power market 
during recent years in new england  the combination of increased competition in the wholesale power market  small increases in the demand for electricity and electric industry deregulation has resulted in increased uncertainty regarding the price of electricity in the wholesale power market 
although great bay s average selling price per kwh determined by dividing total sales revenue by the total number of kwhs sold in the applicable period increased from cents in to cents in and cents in  there can be no assurance that great bay will be able to sell its power at these prices or higher prices in the future 
risks in connection with joint ownership of seabrook project 
great bay is required under the joa to pay its share of seabrook unit and seabrook unit expenses  including without limitation operations and maintenance expenses  construction and nuclear fuel expenditures and decommissioning costs  regardless of seabrook unit s operations 
under certain circumstances  a failure by great bay to make its monthly payments under the joa entitles certain other joint owners of the seabrook project to purchase great bay s interest in the seabrook project for of the then fair market value thereof 
in addition  the failure to make monthly payments under the joa by owners of the seabrook project other than great bay may have a material adverse effect on great bay 
for example  great bay could opt to pay a greater proportion of the seabrook project expenses in order to preserve the value of its share of the seabrook project 
in the past  certain of the owners of the seabrook project other than great bay have not made their full respective payments 
the electric utility industry is undergoing significant changes as competition and deregulation are introduced into the marketplace 
some utilities  including certain participants  have indicated in state regulatory proceedings that they may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection if regulators  as part of the industry restructuring  do not allow for full recovery of stranded costs 
if a participant other than great bay filed for bankruptcy and that participant was unable to pay its share of seabrook project expenses  great bay might opt to pay a greater portion of seabrook project expenses in order to preserve the value of its share of the seabrook project 
in the past  the filing of bankruptcy by a participant has not resulted in a failure to pay seabrook project expenses or an increase in the percentage of expenses paid by other participants 
the seabrook project is owned by great bay and the other owners thereof as tenants in common  with the various owners holding varying ownership shares 
this means that great bay  which owns only a interest  does not have control of the management of the seabrook project 
as a result  decisions may be made affecting the seabrook project notwithstanding great bay s opposition 
certain costs and expenses of operating the seabrook project or owning an interest therein  such as certain insurance and decommissioning costs  are subject to increase or retroactive adjustment based on factors beyond the control of baycorp or great bay 
the cost of disposing of unit of the seabrook project is not known at this time 
these various costs and expenses may adversely affect baycorp and great bay  possibly materially 
extensive government regulation 
the seabrook project is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state agencies 
in particular  the seabrook project and great bay as part owner of a licensed nuclear facility  are subject to the broad jurisdiction of the nrc  which is empowered to authorize the siting  construction and operation of nuclear reactors after consideration of public health and safety  environmental and antitrust matters 
great bay is also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc and  as a result  is required to file with ferc all contracts for the sale of electricity 
ferc s jurisdiction also includes  among other things  the sale  lease  merger  consolidation or other disposition of facilities  interconnection of certain facilities  accounts  service and property records 
noncompliance with nrc requirements may result  among other things  in a shutdown of the seabrook project 
the nrc has promulgated a broad range of regulations affecting all aspects of the design  construction and operation of a nuclear facility  such as the seabrook project  including performance of nuclear safety systems  fire protection  emergency response planning and notification systems  insurance and quality assurance 
the nrc retains authority to modify  suspend or withdraw operating licenses  such as the license pursuant to which the seabrook project operates  at any time that conditions warrant 
for example  the nrc might order seabrook unit shut down i if flaws were discovered in the construction or operation of seabrook unit  ii if problems developed with respect to other nuclear generating plants of a design and construction similar to unit  or iii if accidents at other nuclear facilities suggested that nuclear generating plants generally were less safe than previously believed 
risk of nuclear accident 
nuclear reactors have been used to generate electric power for more than years and there are currently more than nuclear reactors used for electric power generation in the united states 
although the safety record of these nuclear reactors in the united states generally has been very good  accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred both in the united states and elsewhere  including the well publicized incidents at three mile island in pennsylvania and chernobyl in the former soviet union 
the consequences of such an accident can be severe  including loss of life and property damage  and the available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay all the damages incurred 
public controversy concerning nuclear power plants 
substantial controversy has existed for some time concerning nuclear generating plants and over the years such opposition has led to construction delays  cost overruns  licensing delays  demonstrations and other difficulties 
the seabrook project was the subject of significant public controversy during its construction and licensing and remains controversial 
an increase in public concerns regarding the seabrook project or nuclear power in general could adversely affect the operating license of seabrook unit while great bay cannot predict the ultimate effect of such controversy  it is possible that it could result in a premature shutdown of the unit 
waste disposal  decommissioning cost 
there has been considerable public concern and regulatory attention focused upon the disposal of low and high level nuclear wastes produced at nuclear facilities and the ultimate decommissioning of such facilities 
as to waste disposal concerns  both the federal government and the state of new hampshire are currently delinquent in the performance of their statutory obligations 
the joint owners of the seabrook project  through their managing agent naesco  entered into contracts with the doe for high level waste disposal in accordance with the nwpa 
under these contracts and the nwpa  the doe was required to take title to and dispose of the seabrook project s high level waste beginning no later than january  however  the doe has announced that its first high level waste repository will not be in operation until at the earliest 
the seabrook project increased its on site storage capacity for low level waste llw in and that capacity is expected to be sufficient to meet the project s storage requirements through in addition  the managing agent of the seabrook project has advised great bay that the seabrook project has adequate on site storage capacity for high level waste until approximately if the seabrook project were unable to store nuclear waste on site or make other disposal provisions  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
see business nuclear waste disposal 
as to decommissioning  nrc regulations require that upon permanent shutdown of a nuclear facility  appropriate arrangements for full decontamination and decommissioning of the facility be made 
these regulations require that during the operation of a facility  the owners of the facility must set aside sufficient funds to defray decommissioning costs 
while the owners of the seabrook project are accumulating monies in a trust fund to defray decommissioning costs  these costs could substantially exceed the value of the trust fund  and the owners including great bay would remain liable for the excess 
moreover  the amount that is required to be deposited in the trust fund is subject to periodic review and adjustment by an independent commission of the state of new hampshire  which could result in material increases in such amounts 
intense competition 
great bay sells its share of seabrook project electricity primarily into the northeast united states wholesale electricity market 
there are a large number of suppliers to this market and competition is intense 
a primary source of competition comes from traditional utilities  many of which presently have excess capacity 
in addition  non utility wholesale generators of electricity  such as ipps  qfs and ewgs  as well as power marketers and brokers  actively sell electricity in this market 
great bay may face increased competition  primarily based on price  from all sources in the future 
year the year issue relates to computer systems and software that cannot determine whether means the year or systems or software that cannot properly process year dates could give rise to failures or create erroneous results that in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operations  financial results and liquidity 
the company relies on the operation of the seabrook project for nearly all of its revenue 
accordingly  the company s major exposure for year problems is the effect of a plant shutdown partially or completely caused by a year problem 
in addition  year issues could adversely affect electricity metering  transmission  billing or other business processes 
the company does not operate the seabrook project 
rather  the joint owners of the plant  including great bay  have contracted with naesco  a subsidiary of northeast utilities  to operate the plant 
northeast utilities  in conjunction with certain of its affiliates  holds the largest joint ownership interest in the seabrook project 
according to january estimates provided by naesco  great bay s share of costs to address year issues at the seabrook project will be approximately  as of december   great bay s share of costs to address year issues at the seabrook project was approximately  great bay has funded these expenses from its operating revenues 
in assessing year issues associated with the seabrook project  naesco  as of december  developed and implemented a detailed millennium project plan  completed its inventory  analysis and planning for millennium items  identifying approximately  separate items and determining that can be accepted as modified to date or without modification and require further testing  modification or replacement  and worked with the nrc in connection with the nrc s year audit of the seabrook plant  which occurred from september  through october naesco has defined a schedule to implement all year corrective actions 
a number of critical remediation tasks still must be accomplished  most of which are scheduled for completion by june and some of which are scheduled for completion by september some of the more important remaining tasks include naesco s plans to upgrade ibm mainframe software  and idms and inquire database management systems  to year compliant releases  develop contingency plans  and complete critical supplier and embedded systems remediation projects 
naesco commenced year efforts relating to the seabrook project in october naesco s seabrook millennium project plan acknowledges that if  for example  a technical requirement or regulatory commitment is missed or if  for example  a critical supplier does not provide a service  naesco  as operator of the seabrook project  will need to take collective action  which could include an unscheduled shutdown of the plant 
in april the nrc requested that all licensed nuclear power plant operators provide to the nrc  by july   written certification that their facilities are year ready and in compliance with the terms and conditions of their licenses  nrc regulations and the principles outlined in an august nrc nuclear utility year readiness document 
if the plant is not ready  plans and schedules to become ready must be submitted to the nrc 
the company believes that naesco s year efforts at the seabrook project are designed to meet or exceed nrc requirements 
the dates on which naesco believes its year compliance efforts will be completed are based on naesco management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the year compliance efforts 
specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced  and similar uncertainties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties and the interconnection of global businesses  the company cannot ensure that efforts to timely and cost effectively resolve year issues will be successful 
if year compliance efforts are unsuccessful or incomplete  or if costs exceed naesco s estimates  the company s business  operations  financial results and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
the majority of the necessary modifications to the company s centralized financial  customer and operational information systems as opposed to those at the seabrook project were completed by the end of the company believes it will incur minimal year remediation costs associated with its centralized systems
