interest and other income increased by  or  to million for compared to  for  resulting primarily from  of interest income from a million secured loan made in connection with the acquisition of one of the acquired properties 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income resulting from a lower level of cash equivalents in compared to  because cash equivalents had been used to acquire properties 
rental operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted almost entirely from the acquired properties being owned for a full period and the addition of the acquired properties

commitments we are committed to complete the construction of a building and certain related improvements in san diego  california at a remaining cost of approximately million under the terms of two leases 
in addition  we are committed to complete the construction of a building and certain related improvements in gaithersburg  maryland at a remaining cost of between million and million depending on the level of improvements to the facility elected by the tenant under the terms of a lease 
under the terms of the lease  the tenant s rental rate will be adjusted depending on the ultimate cost of the improvements 
we are also committed to fund approximately million for investments in limited partnerships and rental properties  including the construction of tenant improvements under the terms of various leases 
of this amount  approximately million has been set aside in restricted cash accounts to complete the conversion of existing space into higher rent generic laboratory space as well as certain related improvements at columbia street and western avenue 
restricted cash as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  including million in restricted cash 
restricted cash consists of the following in thousands amount reserve for tenant improvements established pursuant to leases at two of our properties  funds held in trust as additional security required under the terms of two of our secured notes payable  security deposit funds based on the terms of certain lease agreements of this amount  million was returned to us in january upon the completion of tenant improvements at western avenue

the following is a summary of the scheduled principal payments for our secured debt as of december  in thousands year amount thereafter  subtotal  unamortized premium  unsecured line of credit alexandria has an unsecured line of credit which provides for borrowings of up to million 
prior to august  our line of credit provided for borrowings of up to million 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a libor based rate or the higher of the bank s reference rate and the federal funds rate plus 
for each libor based advance  we must elect to fix the rate for a period of one  two  three or six months 
the line of credit contains financial covenants  including  among other things  maintenance of minimum market net worth  a total liabilities to gross asset value ratio  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition  the terms of the line of credit restrict  among other things  certain investments  indebtedness  distributions and mergers 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to an amount based on a pool of unencumbered assets 
accordingly  as we acquire additional unencumbered properties  borrowings available under the line of credit will increase  but may not exceed million 
as of december   borrowings under the line of credit were limited to approximately  and carried a weighted average interest rate of 
the line of credit expires may  and provides for annual extensions provided there is no default for two additional one year periods upon notice by the company and consent of the participating banks 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bankboston  na the bank to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our line of credit 
interest paid is calculated at a fixed interest rate of through may  on a notional amount of million and interest received is calculated at one month libor 
the net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense 
the fair value of the swap agreement and changes in the fair value as a result of changes in market interest rates are not recognized in the financial statements 
other resources and liquidity requirements on may   we sold  shares of our common stock to painewebber incorporated for inclusion in the painewebber equity trust reit series i  a unit investment trust 
the shares were issued at a price of per share before discounts and commissions resulting in aggregate proceeds to us  net of offering costs of million  of approximately million 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to make distributions necessary to enable us to continue qualifying as a real estate investment trust 
we also believe that net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund our recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet certain long term liquidity requirements  such as property acquisitions  property development activities  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements  through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  including borrowings under the line of credit  and the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties  we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues 
the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities 
capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing costs the following table shows total and weighted average per square foot capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing costs excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants or are revenue enhancing for the years ended december    and  attributable to leases that commenced at our properties after our acquisition 
total weighted average capital expenditures weighted average square feet in portfolio      property related capital expenditures      per weighted average square foot in portfolio tenant improvements and leasing costs retenanted space retenanted square feet      tenant improvements and leasing costs      per square foot leased renewal space renewal square feet      tenant improvements and leasing costs    per square foot leased capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature  extent  and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants 
we maintain an active preventive maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize required capital improvements 
tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies  the type of lease renewal tenant or retenanted space  the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions 
inflation as of december   approximately of our leases on a square footage basis were triple net leases  requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance  common area and other operating expenses including increases thereto 
in addition  approximately of our leases on a square footage basis required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses 
approximately of our leases on a square footage basis contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed ranging from to or indexed based on the consumer price index or other index 
accordingly  we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow are subject to any significant risk of inflation 
an increase in inflation  however  could result in an increase in our variable rate borrowing cost  including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit 
impact of the year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send tenant invoices  provide building services or engage in similar normal business activities 
we rely on computer technologies to operate our business 
in october  we formed an internal task force to identify  assess and evaluate our critical systems to determine which year related problems may cause system errors or failures 
we have identified three major areas as critical systems i internal accounting systems  ii systems of significant tenants  vendors and financial institutions  and iii internal building systems at our properties 
we have engaged consulting professionals from a nationally recognized accounting firm to review our plans and assist us with our solutions 
the following discussion of our year project contains numerous forward looking statements based on inherently uncertain information 
the cost of our evaluation and the date on which we plan to complete our internal evaluation and related remediation projects are based on our best estimates 
we derived these estimates using a number of assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of internal and external resources  third party modifications and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results may be materially different from those anticipated 
moreover  although we believe that we will be operating in a year compliant manner prior to december   there can be no assurance that any failure to modify a critical system would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
readiness our year project is designed to ensure that all critical systems have been evaluated and will be suitable for continued use into and beyond the year we expect to have completed our identification and initial evaluation of critical systems in the first quarter of  and we expect we will have implemented substantially all of the necessary remedial actions by mid we have completed our review of our internal accounting systems 
our most significant accounting systems  our general ledger system and our accounts payable system  are currently year compliant 
the systems will be tested  but we do not anticipate year problems 
our billing system is currently not year compliant 
we have been notified by the vendor that they will be distributing the year compliant upgrade to the software at no additional cost by june once we receive this upgrade  the software will be tested for compatibility and year compliance 
we place a high degree of reliance on computer systems of third parties  such as tenants  vendors and financial institutions 
although we are assessing the readiness of these third parties  there can be no guarantee that the failure of these third parties to modify their systems in advance of december  would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have surveyed our most significant third party vendors and financial institutions  and all surveyed indicated that they have implemented year programs 
we are currently in the process of surveying all major vendors and suppliers for their year readiness 
in addition  we are in the process of surveying our significant tenants for their year readiness and expect to complete such tenant assessments in the first quarter of we are continually participating in such surveys with new tenants  vendors and other third party suppliers 
if future risk assessments of third party suppliers or tenants indicate significant exposure from a supplier s year problem  such supplier or tenant will be asked to demonstrate how such problems will be addressed 
we believe that we have viable alternatives for each of our major vendors 
the final critical system the task force is evaluating consists of internal systems in our properties that may have embedded microprocessors with potential year problems  mainly building systems  including heating  ventilation and air conditioning systems  elevators and security systems 
we are in the process of identifying the areas and systems that use embedded microprocessors and will determine whether any modification or replacement is necessary 
we anticipate using the services of outside experts to assist us with this phase of our year project 
the evaluation of these areas is in process and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of  and any required modifications are expected to be made by mid cost we do not expect our year project costs  including the costs of any remedial activities and outside experts  to be material 
the aggregate cost of purchasing conversion packages for the accounting systems and the cost to survey tenants  vendors and financial institutions are not expected to be material 
in addition  any costs incurred to replace or upgrade building systems will constitute property maintenance costs  and are therefore generally recoverable from the tenants pursuant to the terms of their existing leases 
risks we believe that the principal risks associated with the year issue include the risk of disruption of our operations due to operational failures of third parties  including tenants  vendors and financial institutions  and the risk of business interruption due to building system failures 
we do not believe that the risk of disruptions due to operational failures of vendors or financial institutions is significant  because our major vendors and financial institutions are currently year compliant  and we believe we have viable alternatives for such suppliers 
if any of our major tenants do not become year compliant on schedule  such tenant s operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  which may impact the tenant s ability to meet its rent obligations 
similarly  if our building systems failed due to year problems  services to our properties and tenants  such as mechanical and security services  could be interrupted  resulting in potential rent disputes with the tenants 
we believe  however  that our early involvement in identifying  assessing and evaluating our critical systems should minimize the risk of year problems to our operations 
contingency plans we believe that development of contingency plans for significant exposures to potential year problems are integral to our planning process 
once we have completed our identification and evaluation of critical systems and have completed the subsequent remedial action phase  we will again assess our exposure to year problems 
based on this assessment  we intend to develop appropriate contingency plans for the systems 
because we anticipate being substantially year compliant by mid  we believe that adequate time exists to ensure that alternatives can be developed  assessed and implemented prior to the end of based on our assessment of the success or adequacy of these alternatives  we intend to develop contingency plans 
we cannot give assurance  however  that failure to develop an alternative or an appropriate contingency plan would not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
funds from operations we believe that funds from operations ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to make distributions 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in its march white paper the white paper  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits  and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for our discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  and excluding amounts for extraordinary and non recurring items  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
see cash flows for information regarding these measures of cash flow

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
in order to modify and manage the interest characteristics of our outstanding debt and limit the effects of interest rates on our operations  we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks such as counter party credit risk and legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  such as libor 
however  due to the purchase of our interest rate swap agreement  the effects of interest rate changes are reduced 
based on interest rates at december   a increase in interest rates on our line of credit would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreement  by approximately million 
a decrease in interest rates on our line of credit would increase annual future earnings and cash flows  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreement  by approximately million 
a increase interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreement would decrease their fair value by approximately million 
a decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreement would increase their fair value by approximately million 
a increase or decrease in interest rates on our secured note receivable would not have a material impact on its fair value 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreement 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure
