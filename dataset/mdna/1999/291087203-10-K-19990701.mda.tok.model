year the year issue is primarily the result of computer programs or databases using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to represent a calendar year 
some computer systems will be unable to correctly interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to a disruption in the operation or accuracy of such systems 
the company has undertaken a company wide study and testing program to locate and cure any year issues in the products or systems on which it relies and in the products it offers for sale

the company has and will incur internal staff costs related to the above initiative

the company s year assessment is ongoing and the consideration of contingency plans will continue to be evaluated as new information becomes available 
at this stage  however  the company has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if any of the third parties upon which the company is dependent is unable to achieve year compliance
