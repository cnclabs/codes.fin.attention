certain reclassifications have been made in the following discussion and analysis to present results of operations on a consistent basis 
results of operations net income for was million  or per diluted share  on net sales of  million  compared with a net loss for of million  or per diluted share  on net sales of  million  adjusted to exclude net sales of mcms of million and the gain of million net of tax  or 
per diluted share  from the sale of of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  mcms 
without adjusting for the sale of mcms  net income for was million  or per diluted share on net sales of  million 
the company s consolidated gross margin percent increased to in from in the company s pc systems segment had net sales of  million and an operating loss of million in compared with net sales of  million and an operating loss of million in the reduction in the operating loss of the pc systems segment is primarily due to improved gross margins and lower operating expenses  that were partially offset by significantly lower average selling prices 
gross margins for pc systems were in compared with in primarily due to better inventory management  and an improved sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for were lower than for  primarily due to actions taken by the company to lower the overall cost structure in february to concentrate on its core markets and customers  including the consolidation of its domestic and international operations and the reduction of approximately of its workforce 
the company s spectek operations had net sales of million and operating income of million in compared to net sales of million and operating income of million  primarily due to a increase in megabits shipped and higher gross margins on products shipped 
gross margin for was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in improvement in the gross margin is primarily due to improved productivity from higher volumes shipped and the mix of parts received during the year from mti and purchased from parties not associated with the component recovery agreement 
the percentage of product shipped not subject to the component recovery agreement in was compared to in sg a and other expenses remained approximately the same year over year 
on august   the company acquired of the outstanding stock of netlimited  inc dba hostpro  for million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the company s results of operations include those of hostpro since the acquisition date 
on september   the company acquired the property and equipment of micron internet services  formerly a division of mti  for its book value of million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the company s results of operations for were not affected by this transaction 
on february   the company completed the sale of of its interest in mcms  inc  formerly micron custom manufacturing services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
in exchange for the interest in mcms  inc  the company received million in cash 
results of operations of the company for include a pre tax gain of million million or per diluted share  after taxes 
the company s financial statements include the results of mcms  inc s operation through the date of sale 
net sales of mcms  inc  in and were million and million  respectively 
net sales the following table summarizes the company s net sales by operating segment amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales pc systems    spectek operations    mcms   total net sales    pc systems 
net sales of computer systems were lower in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices and slightly lower unit sales 
the decline in average selling prices for the company s desktop  notebook  and server system sales  and were   and respectively 
lower prices were largely the result of continued industry price competitiveness and the company s aggressive pricing strategy designed to gain entry into key markets 
the decrease in unit sales is primarily attributed to a drop in the company s desktop computer systems which was partially offset by a increase in the company s sale of higher margin server systems 
unit sales of computer systems were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the third quarter of fiscal this was due to a increase in desktop unit sales  an increase in notebook unit sales  and a increase in server unit sales 
net sales of computer systems were lower in compared to primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices for the company s computer systems partially offset by an increase in unit sales and a higher level of non system revenue 
the decline in average selling prices was primarily attributable to a decrease in the selling prices for the company s desktop computer systems and a decline in selling prices for notebook systems 
lower prices were largely the result of industry price competitiveness  particularly for notebook products  and to the company s efforts to price its products more in line with its competition 
unit sales were higher in compared to  due primarily to a increase in unit sales of the company s notebook products 
unit sales of computer systems were higher in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the third quarter  primarily due to a increase in desktop unit sales and a increase in server unit sales  partially offset by a decline in unit sales of notebooks 
unit sales of desktop systems were of total unit sales in compared to in and in unit sales of notebook systems were of total unit sales in compared to and of total pc system sales during and  respectively 
unit sales of computer systems featuring intel celeron and pentium iii microprocessors represented and  respectively 
in addition  unit sales of computer systems incorporating intel pentium ii microprocessors and pentium microprocessors with mmx technology represented and  respectively  of total units sold in  compared to and  respectively  of total units sold in net sales of pc systems in were and higher in the commercial and public sectors  respectively  compared to these increases were offset by lower net sales of computer systems in the consumer sector 
the growth in commercial sales was largely attributable to the presence of an expanded sales force competing for commercial customers 
public sector net sales increased as the company improved its position as a gsa supplier  expanded its sales force  and had continued success in winning new contracts and retaining existing ones 
international sales of pc systems represented of total pc system sales in compared to in net sales to the public sector represented of total net sales for  an increase from in both and the future level of the company s public sales is dependent on the buying practices of governmental entities and the company s success in being selected to participate in government contracts 
in particular  during the company successfully increased the volume purchase agreements vpa s with the federal government and its agencies 
as of september   the company had increased the number of vpa s to compared to in spectek operations 
net sales of memory products were higher in compared to  primarily due to a significant increase in megabits of memory sold  partially offset by declining average selling prices 
average selling prices in were lower compared to  while megabits of memory sold in were higher compared to the increase in megabits of memory products shipped in compared to was primarily due to reduced component test time and product transition to the megabit component from the megabit component  both resulting in increased throughput from substantially all memory products 
net sales of memory products were lower in compared to  due to a decline in average selling prices  partially offset by a increase in megabits of memory sold 
the spectek operations results of operations are influenced by a number of factors including pricing for  and availability of  nonstandard memory components

mcms 
the company completed the sale of of its interest in mcms on february   accordingly  results of operations of mcms subsequent to february  are excluded from the company s results of operations 
gross margin amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales pc systems    spectek operations    mcms   total gross margin    pc systems 
the company s gross margin on sales of pc systems was million or higher in compared to  principally due to lower component cost from improved asset management and a change in the sales mix towards higher margin systems  while being partially offset by a decline in average selling prices 
lower component cost in resulted from improved asset management compared to  as evidenced by annualized inventory turns of times 
while overall average selling prices for the pc systems products declined in compared to  unit sales of higher margin servers increased in compared with the company continues to experience significant pressure on its gross margins as a result of intense competition in the pc industry and consumer expectations of more powerful pc systems at lower prices 
in addition  the company s gross margin percentage will continue to depend in large part on its ability to effectively manage its inventories of pc system components 
see certain factors pc systems competition and certain factors pc systems inventory management 
the company s gross margin on sales of pc systems was million lower in compared to gross margin for fiscal was negatively impacted by a decline in average selling prices of the company s notebook products 
the gross margin percentage for sale of the company s pc systems decreased in compared to primarily as a result of losses realized from disposition of pc component inventories 
as a result of intense price pressure on notebook products during fiscal  the company s gross margins were adversely affected by significantly lower gross margins realized from sales of the company s notebook products 
this was offset  however  by a favorable adjustment of approximately million dollars in the fourth quarter of that related to revisions of estimates of contingencies for product and process technology costs for two patent infringement matters based on new information learned by management in the fourth quarter of spectek operations 
the gross margin on semiconductor sales was million or higher in compared to principally due to an increase in megabits shipped and lower average cost per components purchased from sources other than mti  while being partially offset by lower average selling prices 
megabits shipped in compared to were up due to improved manufacturing productivity and the transition from the to megabit dram and sdram 
the average selling price per megabit declined in compared to the gross margin percentage realized in compared to was lower primarily because of lower average selling prices 
average selling prices in were lower compared to the gross margin for spectek operations could decline as the result of falling average selling prices and or an increase in cost of components 
these circumstances could adversely affect the company s business  financial position  and results of operations and cash flows

mcms 
the company completed the sale of of its interest in mcms on february   accordingly  results of operations of mcms subsequent to february  are excluded from the company s results of operations 
selling  general and administrative amount change amount change amount total sg a expenses    as a of net sales sg a expense for fiscal declined million compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to lower advertising expense  and lower technical and professional fees 
in addition  during february  the company reduced its work force by approximately 
the company further reduced its sg a cost structure by the sale of its mcms operation in the second quarter of fiscal  and the closure its japanese operation in the second quarter of fiscal internal software expense also decreased as a result of the company adopting the provisions of sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  in the first quarter of fiscal sg a expense was also lower in compared to because of lower bad debt expense 
sg a costs were higher in compared to primarily due to higher levels of personnel costs and advertising associated with the company s pc operations and higher technical and professional fees primarily associated with information technology consulting services 
research and development amount change amount change amount total research and development    as a of net sales research and development expenses declined in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease is due to the discontinuance of the advanced engineering group during the year partially offset by a charge of million for the write off of purchased in process research and development related to the acquisition of hostpro 
hostpro s development efforts centered on customer support and service for systems  delivered through the internet 
the product is licensed to resellers and used internally by hostpro 
hostpro s in process technology development is aimed toward increasing the performance and redundancy of its web hosting systems 
because the development work conducted by hostpro was tailored to meet its specific infrastructure requirements and processes  alternative future uses of these development technologies do not exist 
technological feasibility of these in process projects had not been achieved as of the acquisition date  and significant technological risk remained 
the in process research and development write off related to the hostpro acquisition was million  and was based on estimated future revenues of million over the next six years 
management expects to complete all projects in fiscal however  to the extent that any of these projects are delayed or development efforts are unsuccessful  the impact to the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows are expected to be minimal 
the in process projects are 
customer service package 
the development efforts are focused on enabling remote management of accounts and automatic management and provisioning of web sites through a customer extranet 
management believes this project will be completed by november and that the company will begin to receive benefits at such time 

automated utility system 
the development of this software package is for use in monitoring network connections  bandwidth usage and server status 
this proprietary technology is an automated utility programmed to monitor and respond to trends in server traffic 
in addition  this system will display vital statistics of the server for external monitoring and maintenance 
management believes this project will be completed by may and that the company will begin to receive benefits at such time 

ip routing redundancy program 
this network infrastructure design effort is intended to increase network fault tolerance and will enable hostpro servers to share storage systems and dynamically allocate server requests 
management believes this project will be completed by december  and that the company will begin to receive benefits at such time 
for the identified in process projects  estimated cost to complete subsequent to the acquisition date was million 
based on a combination of man months  costs incurred and management s estimate of project completion  the projects were determined to be complete 
hostpro s planned research and development projects for which no significant efforts have been made were not included in the valuation 
the key assumptions in determining the incomplete in process technologies were 
discounted cash flows 
a discounted cash flows analysis of products incorporating in process technology was developed based on management s estimates of revenue and expenses associated with the products 

selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses was forecast based on historical ratios and industry standards 
projected sg a expenses decrease as a percentage of projected revenues due to expected sales growth with sg a expenses growth at a slower rate 
sg a expenses were assumed to remain of projected revenues instead of increasing due to the significant growth expected for internet companies during the next six years 

research and development 
additional research and development costs were projected based on management s estimate of future costs required to advance the design of the technology to the point that it met specific functional and economic requirements 

discount rate 
cash flow streams associated with in process technologies were discounted to present value at a rate of return an investor would require for a project with a risk profile similar to hostpro 
the discount rate for in process technology reflects the high risk profile attributable to this technology 
research and development expenses were slightly higher in compared to primarily as a result of the development activities associated with the company s netframe enterprise server operation 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of netframe for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets and in process research and development  based on their fair values 
at the time of the acquisition  the company recognized a charge of million for the write off of purchased in process research and development 
the fair value of netframe s technology was determined by an independent appraiser through an analysis using a risk adjusted cash flow model 
estimated future cash flows derived from the technology or products incorporating the technology were discounted taking into account risks related to existing and future markets and assessment of the life expectancy of such technology 
technology was segregated into that which was determined to be completed those currently technologically feasible but that may require adjustments or relatively minor enhancements and in process technologies that require additional research and development efforts to reach technological feasibility 
the analysis resulted in the allocation of million of purchase price to completed technology  which was capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of months 
in process research and development was valued by an independent appraiser using the same methodology as completed technology 
estimated future cash flows associated with in process research and development were discounted considering risks and uncertainties related to the viability  work required to establish feasibility  and to the completion of products ultimately to be marketed by the company 
the analysis resulted in the allocation of million of purchase price to in process research and development 
in management s opinion  the acquired in process research and development had not yet reached a stage where feasibility  delivery or product features were certain at july  and had no alternative future use 
as a result  acquired in process research and development was charged to expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  million of purchase price was allocated to other identified intangible assets  which were capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of months 
in the second quarter of  the company wrote off the remaining book value of capitalized current technologies and other intangible assets as a result of the consolidation of the company s netframe enterprise server operation with its other pc operations and the discontinuance of further development of future enterprise server technologies 
other expense income  net amount change amount change amount total other expense income  net    other expense for fiscal included million associated with the company s closure and consolidation of its micron electronics japan operation into its nampa operations 
the charge includes those costs associated with employee payroll and severance of million for approximately employees  fixed asset write downs of million  lease obligations of million  pre committed advertising of million  and million for other closure related costs 
all remaining liabilities were settled by september  with the cessation of its japanese operations  the company benefited from an approximately million reduction of sg a expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal other expense in fiscal included million million in the second quarter of fiscal less a million revision of estimates in the fourth quarter of fiscal for costs associated with the company s actions to realign its pc operations to concentrate on its core markets and customers 
such actions include the consolidation of the company s domestic and international pc operations and the reduction of of its workforce  or approximately employees  from generally all areas of the company 
the realignment costs consisted of million associated with employee termination benefits  million for the write down of equipment and leasehold improvements  million in estimated costs for claims related to the realignment  million in aggregate costs associated with vacating a leased facility in milpitas  california  two international sales offices and an outlet store in minneapolis  minnesota  million for the write off of current technologies and million for the write off other intangible assets consisting of customer lists  trade names  workforce and distribution and other contracts associated with the company s netframe enterprise servers 
as a result of the realignment  the company benefited from an approximately million reduction of sg a expenses in fiscal compared to other expense in also included million for the write off of capitalized costs associated with abandoned internal use enterprise software development projects 
the software included an order entry system  an order configuration tool  and part of a material requirements planning package 
the software was abandoned after the company concluded such software lacked the functionality desired by the company 
the company also recognized a benefit resulting from a net rebate of million associated with a change of providers of on site service contracts for the company s domestic desktop installed base 
income tax provision amount change amount change amount income tax provision    the provision for income taxes in reflects the company s effective tax rate of which reflected the federal statutory rate  the net effect of state taxes  and the effect of a million charge for the write off of in process research and development  which resulted from the company s acquisition of hostpro in the fourth quarter 
the effective income tax rate in was  reflecting the federal statutory rate  the net effect of state taxes and the establishment of a million valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset relating to the company s consolidation of its netframe enterprise server operations 
the effective tax rate in of reflected the federal statutory rate  the net effect of state taxes  and the effect of a million charge for the write off of in process research and development  which resulted from the company s acquisition of netframe in the fourth quarter 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and liquid investments of million  representing a decrease of million compared to september  the decrease resulted primarily from the acquisitions during the year 
principal sources of liquidity in were million from the company s operating activities  million from sales of property  plant and equipment  and million from the issuance of common stock

along with the derivatives  the underlying hedged items are also to be marked to market on an ongoing basis 
these market value adjustments are to be included either in the statement of operations or as a component of comprehensive income  depending on the nature of the transaction 
implementation of sfas no 
is required for the company by the first quarter of the company is currently evaluating the effect sfas will have on its future results of operations and financial position 
certain factors in addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this form k and in other company filings with the securities and exchange commission  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the historical results of the company s operations or those results or events contemplated in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
general fluctuations in operating results and stock price the company s past operating results have been  and its future operating results may be  subject to seasonality and other fluctuations  on a quarterly and an annual basis  as a result of a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  industry competition  the company s ability to accurately forecast demand and selling prices for its pc products  fluctuating market pricing for pcs and semiconductor memory products  seasonal government purchasing cycles  inventory obsolescence  the company s ability to effectively manage inventory levels  changes in product mix  manufacturing and production constraints  fluctuating component costs  the effects of product reviews and industry awards  availability and pricing of the memory components used by the company s spectek operations  critical component availability  seasonal cycles common in the pc industry  the timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors and global market and economic conditions 
as a result  the operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may occur in any future period 
the trading price of the common stock of the company is subject to significant fluctuations due to general market conditions and financial performance of the company and other companies in the pc industry  announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products or new strategies by competitors  component availability and pricing  and other factors 
management the company has experienced increased complexity of its operations  in operating and financial information systems and in its scope of operations 
the increased complexity of the company s operations results from a number of factors  including the expansion of the company s internet and service offerings 
this increased complexity has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for the company s management and has placed  and continues to place  significant demands upon the company s management  operating and financial information systems and other resources and systems 
in addition  during the past year  the company underwent numerous changes in its management structure and personnel 
the company continues to consider various expansion alternatives  including expansion of facilities  acquisition or establishment of facilities in new geographic regions and certain strategic relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company s management resources  operating and financial information systems  other resources and systems will be adequate to support the company s existing or future operations  the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
intellectual property matters it is common in the electronics industry for patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights claims to be asserted against companies  including component suppliers and pc manufacturers 
periodically  the company is made aware that technology used by the company may infringe on intellectual property rights held by others 
the company evaluates all such claims and  if necessary and appropriate  seeks to obtain licenses for the continued use of such technology 
the company has accrued a liability and charged operations for the estimated costs of settlement or adjudication of claims for alleged infringement as of the balance sheet date 
the company would be placed at a competitive disadvantage if it were unable to obtain such licenses upon terms at least as favorable as those experienced by the company s competitors 
the company has entered into several intellectual property license agreements  and as a majority owned subsidiary of mti  is licensed under certain license agreements between mti and third parties 
the company s rights under license agreements between mti and third parties may terminate in the event that the company is no longer a majority owned subsidiary of mti 
intellectual property license agreements generally require one time or periodic royalty payments and are subject to expiration at various times 
if the company or its suppliers are unable to obtain licenses necessary to use intellectual property in their products or processes  the company may be forced to market products without certain technological features or software  discontinue sales of certain of its products and or defend legal actions taken against it relating to allegedly protected technology 
the inability of the company to obtain licenses necessary to use certain technology  or an inability to obtain such licenses on competitive terms  or any litigation determining that the company  in the manufacture or sale of its products  has infringed on the intellectual property rights of third parties  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  and results of operations and cash flows 
mti ownership of common stock of the company as of september   mti owned approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
in addition  two of the five directors of the company are also directors of mti  including steven r 
appleton  chairman and chief executive officer of mti 
so long as mti continues to own a majority of the outstanding common stock of the company  mti will have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  and generally will have the ability to control the management and certain financial and other affairs of the company 
termination or modification of certain of the company s arrangements with mti resulting in terms less favorable to the company could adversely affect the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in the event that mti s ownership of the company were to decrease below certain levels  certain arrangements may be terminated by mti  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see intellectual property matters and spectek operations dependence on component recovery agreement with mti 
the level of mti s ownership of the common stock of the company may limit the company s ability to complete future equity financing 
in addition  the sale on the open market of substantial amounts of shares of common stock of the company currently held by mti could adversely affect the prevailing market price of common stock of the company 
mti s ability to sell shares of common stock of the company  unless registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  is subject to volume and other restrictions pursuant to rule promulgated under the securities act 
dependence on key personnel the future success of the company will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain key management  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
the company attempts to enhance its management and technical expertise by recruiting qualified individuals who possess desired skills and experience in certain targeted areas 
there is competition for such personnel in the electronics  internet and computer services industries  and the company s inability to retain employees and attract and retain sufficient additional employees  and information technology  engineering and technical support resources  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there can be no assurance that the company will not lose key personnel or that the loss of any key personnel will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
year the year issue has arisen because many computer hardware and software systems only use the last two digits in reference to yearly periods 
therefore  after december   some hardware and software systems may erroneously read  or attempt to read  as  rather than many computer applications could fail or return erroneous or unpredictable results if not timely corrected 
state of readiness in  the company established a year project team with representatives from generally all areas of the company 
the project team is focusing principally on the following four areas internal information technology it systems  internal non it systems including embedded technology associated with its manufacturing and physical facilities  third parties with whom the company has significant business relationships  and the company s products 
generally  the company s year compliance program with respect to its internal it and non it systems consists of the following phases a inventory the identification of systems which may be impacted  b assessment the review of identified systems for year compliance  c remediation the implementation of corrective action and  if need be  the execution of contingency plans  and d quality assurance testing the verification of year compliance 
with respect to it systems  the company believes  as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  that the inventory  assessment  and remediation phases are essentially complete  and quality assurance testing is approximately complete 
with respect to non it systems  the inventory and assessment phases are essentially complete and the remediation phase is approximately complete 
the remainder of calendar will be used for quality assurance testing and the resolution of any unforeseen difficulties 
the company has developed a process with respect to its assessment of year readiness of third parties with whom the company has significant business relationships 
the company is focusing its efforts on the business relationships most critical to its manufacturing operations  customer service and other core business processes  including key suppliers  vendors  financial institutions and utility and transportation providers 
the process generally involves the following phases a initial supplier survey  b risk assessment  c follow up supplier review where necessary  and d contingency planning where relevant 
as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had received formal responses from all of its critical third party providers 
most of such providers indicated that they expect to address year issues in a timely manner 
risk assessments with respect to third party providers are essentially complete and as a result  follow up reviews of the third party providers were performed where necessary 
third party suppliers that fail to meet the company s requirements with respect to year issues may be replaced with other suppliers 
all micron branded hardware products support the year date and calculations 
all micron branded hardware products shipped since august   have bios clocks that will automatically roll over to after december  additionally  the company has made available software utilities that will cause earlier micron branded hardware products to have bios clocks that will recognize the century change 
all netframe branded server products shipped since march are either nstl certified as year compliant or self certified as having real time clock chips and a bios that will process date data correctly on and after january  the company has a web site dedicated to communicating year issues to its customers 
cost to address year issues the estimated costs of the company s year readiness programs with respect to internal it and non it systems and third party providers are not expected to be material to the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had incurred aggregate incremental costs of million related to such readiness programs 
the total additional cost to complete such programs is estimated at million to million 
these estimated costs do not include costs related to the potential failure of key suppliers to timely address year issues  potential costs related to any customer or other product liability claims or the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the ordinary course of business 
the incremental and estimated costs include allocated costs of the company s information technology organization incurred in connection with year compliance projects 
all estimates are based on currently known circumstances and various assumptions regarding future events  and actual costs could differ materially from the estimates 
the company believes that it has no obligation for any costs incurred by its customers to address year issues 
however  the company recognizes the potential for claims against it and other manufacturers arising from products which may not support the century change  and there can be no assurance that such claims would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
on october   the company was sued in state court in canyon county  idaho  by hannah films  inc  on behalf of itself and on behalf of an unidentified and uncertified class of plaintiffs alleging fraud  breach of implied warranty of merchantability  violation of the magnuson moss consumer protection act  and violation of the idaho consumer protection act arising out of the year status of a personal computer sold by the company to hannah films  inc  in october in may  the case was dismissed with prejudice 
the plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal 
while there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of the case  the company does not currently believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
year contingency plans the company s contingency plan generally contemplates replacement or alternative sources of those goods and services necessary to the company s manufacturing and business operations 
should those necessary goods and services become unavailable due to a supplier s failure to achieve year readiness  the company will review  and where appropriate  modify existing contingency plans to address specific year issues as they arise 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company s year project team advised the company s management of critical third party providers which  based on information received  have not yet offered full assurance of year compliance 
the company expects that development of contingency plans will continue through calendar the discussion above regarding year projected completion dates  costs  risks and other forward looking statements is based on currently available information  and is subject to change 
based on currently available information  the company does not believe that the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios with respect to year issues are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that year remediation efforts by the company or third parties will be completed in a timely and proper manner  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company 
additionally  an increase in customer claims with respect to the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  and results of operations and cash flows 
government regulation the company is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  federal communications commission regulations  governmental procurement regulations  import and export regulations  federal trade commission regulations  securities regulations  environmental regulations  antitrust regulations  and labor regulations 
any failure by the company to comply with such regulations in the past  present or future could subject the company to liabilities and or the suspension of its operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
pc systems competition the pc industry is highly competitive and has been characterized by intense pricing pressure  generally low gross margin percentages  rapid technological advances in hardware and software  frequent introduction of new products  and rapidly declining component costs 
competition in the pc industry is based primarily upon brand name recognition  performance  price  reliability and service and support 
the company s sales of pc systems have historically benefited from increased name recognition and market acceptance of the company s pc systems  primarily resulting from the receipt by the company of awards from trade publications recognizing the price and performance characteristics of micron brand pc systems and the company s service and support functions 
as a result of pc industry standards  the company and its competitors use many of the same components  typically from the same set of suppliers  which limits the company s ability to technologically and functionally differentiate its products 
many of the company s pc competitors have greater brand name recognition and market share  offer broader product lines  and have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  the company s competitors may benefit from component volume purchasing and product and process technology license arrangements that are more favorable in terms of pricing and availability than the company s arrangements 
in addition  the company may be at a relative cost disadvantage to certain of its competitors as a result of the company s us dollar denominated purchases of pc components during a period of relative weakening of the us dollar 
the failure of the company to compete effectively in the marketplace could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company competes with a number of pc manufacturers  which sell their products primarily through direct channels  including dell computer  corporation  and gateway  inc the company also competes with pc manufacturers  such as apple computer  inc  compaq computer corporation  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation  nec corporation and toshiba corporation among others 
several of these manufacturers  which have traditionally sold their products through national and regional distributors  dealers and value added resellers  and retail stores  now sell their products through the direct channel 
in addition  the company expects to face increased competition in the us direct sales market from foreign pc suppliers and from foreign and domestic suppliers of pc products that decide to implement  or devote additional resources to  a direct sales strategy 
in order to gain an increased share of the united states pc direct sales market  these competitors may effect a pricing strategy that is more aggressive than the current pricing in the direct sales market or may have pricing strategies influenced by relative fluctuations in the us dollar compared to other currencies 
the competitive environment for internet services is similarly intense with rapid technological changes resulting in pricing pressure in the market for internet access  and to a lesser extent other web hosting services 
many of the competitors in the provision of internet services have significantly greater name recognition and larger customer bases than the company 
the company believes that the rate of growth in worldwide sales of pc systems  particularly in the united states  where the company sells a substantial majority of its pc systems  has declined and may remain below the growth rates experienced in recent years 
any general decline in demand or decline in the rate of increase in demand for pc systems could increase price competition and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inventory management the company s ability to compete successfully in the pc market in the future will depend in large part on its ability to accurately forecast demand for its pc products and effectively manage its pc inventories to support this demand 
the company s pc operations focus on the direct sale of assemble to order pc systems that feature components incorporating the latest technological developments in the pc industry 
the company has experienced in the past  and could experience in the future  excess pc inventories and inventory obsolescence resulting from  among other things  the company s inaccuracy in forecasting demand for its pc products  the typically longer lead times associated with notebook product supply  the fast pace of technological developments in the pc industry and the short product life cycles of pc systems and components 
in addition  because high volumes of quality components are required for the manufacture of the company s pc systems  the company has experienced in the past  and expects to experience in the future  shortages and other supply constraints of key components 
such shortages or supply constraints have in the past adversely affected  and could in the future adversely affect  the company s ability to ship products on schedule or at expected gross margins 
the company has made significant progress in changing its asset management processes where substantial improvements have been realized with minimal material shortage impact to customer orders  achieving dramatic growth in inventory turns  and industry leading days sale of inventory dsi 
the company continues to invest in data systems tools acquisitions to further enhance sales forecasting and supply demand planning processes 
the company has made a large investment in its new manufacturing facilities to further reduce the risks of having excess inventory or inability to produce customer orders 
to continue its successful improvements  the company must accurately utilize these new processes  facilities and tools to improve its forecast demand for its pc products and obtain adequate  but not excessive  supplies of components to meet actual demand 
the failure of the company to manage its inventories effectively could result in excess pc inventories  inventory obsolescence  component shortages and untimely shipment of products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
dependence on key sources of supply the company focuses on providing pc systems that feature components and software incorporating the latest technological developments in the pc industry  which components are periodically in short supply and are available from sole or a limited number of suppliers 
as a result  the company has experienced in the past  and expects to experience in the future  shortages in the components used in its pc systems 
the microprocessors used in the company s pc systems are manufactured exclusively by intel and  from time to time  the company has been unable to obtain sufficient quantities of certain intel microprocessors 
in addition  a significant portion of the ram components used in the company s pc systems are supplied by mti  and the company generally relies on mti to supply the latest memory densities and configurations available 
the company relies  to a certain extent  upon its suppliers abilities to enhance existing products in a timely and cost effective manner  to develop new products to meet changing customer needs and to respond to emerging standards and other technological developments in the pc industry 
the company s reliance on a limited number of suppliers and on a strategy of incorporating the latest technological developments into its pc systems involves several risks  including the possibility of shortages and or increases in costs of components and software  and risk of reduced control over delivery schedules  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s notebook products are currently assembled in part by third party manufacturers 
these outsourcing arrangements and any future outsourcing arrangements that the company may enter into may reduce the direct control the company has over certain components and the assembly of such products 
there can be no assurance that the outsourcing arrangements will not result in quality problems or affect the ability to ship such products on a timely basis or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions 
acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of hostpro for approximately million and the property and equipment of mis  for its book value of approximately million 
hostpro is a web and applications hosting provider 
the hostpro acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets and in process research and development  and goodwill based on their fair values as determined by and independent appraiser 
mis is a provider of dedicated  nationwide dial up and broadband internet access  virtual private networks vpn solutions  and e commerce services to small and medium sized businesses  public organizations and consumers 
the mis asset purchase was accounted for at historical cost 
the company is performing an ongoing evaluation regarding the nature and scope of the operations of hostpro and mis as well as considering various short and long term strategies as to whether and to what extent integration  reconfiguration or other modifications of the separate businesses is appropriate following the acquisition 
there can be no assurance that the integration  reconfiguration or other modification  if any  of hostpro or mis will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  there can be no assurance the company will realize the anticipated benefits associated with the acquisition  including  but not limited to  retention of key personnel  acceptance of hostpro and mis e services in the market  technology  intellectual property rights  increased market presence of a broader e services offering and economies of providing certain administrative support functions 
state taxation during the third quarter of fiscal  the company began to collect and remit applicable sales or use taxes in nearly all states 
in association therewith  the company is party to agreements with nearly all states which generally limit the liability of the company  if any  for non remittance of sales and use taxes prior to such agreements effective dates 
the company has previously accrued a liability for the estimated settlement cost of issues related to sales and use taxes not covered by such agreements 
management believes the resolution of any matters relating to the non remittance of sales or use will not materially effect the business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
spectek operations dependence on component recovery agreement with mti effective september   the company and mti entered into an amended and restated component recovery agreement the component recovery agreement which expires august   unless terminated earlier as described below 
under the component recovery agreement  mti is required to offer to the company all of the nonstandard memory components produced at mti s semiconductor operations 
the component recovery agreement provides that the cost of components obtained from mti will be negotiated on a quarterly basis  but in no event will the cost be less than of pre tax net income 
the maximum cost payable by the company to mti for components during fiscal will be as follows first quarter  of pre tax net income  second quarter  of pre tax net income  third quarter  of pre tax net income  and fourth quarter  of pre tax net income 
the cost to the company for components obtained from mti during fiscal is not subject to any maximum amount 
there can be no assurance that the amounts payable by the company to mti for components as contemplated under the component recovery agreement would be more favorable than the maximum amounts stated in this paragraph 
the quarter to quarter increase in maximum cost to the company to obtain components from mti under the component recovery agreement could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the component recovery agreement also provides that mti will make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for the company nonstandard memory components produced by tech semiconductor singapore pte 
ltd 
and kmt semiconductor limited  joint venture companies in which mti is affiliated 
the company  mti and the joint venture companies may agree to utilize a pricing matrix based on effective yields and worldwide average sales prices in order to establish prices for the components from the joint venture companies 
in such case  the price paid by the company for components from the joint ventures will be determined under the matrix  rather than as a percentage of pre tax net income 
under the component recovery agreement  at the commencement of the second quarter of fiscal the company has an option to require mti to purchase the property and equipment of spectek operations for a purchase price equal to net book value 
at the commencement of fiscal  mti has an option to require the company to sell the property and equipment of spectek operations under the same terms and conditions 
additionally  the company has an option to require mti to purchase  and mti has the option to require the company to sell  the assets of spectek operations at book value if mti s ownership in the company falls below or if an unrelated third party acquires more than of the company 
the component recovery agreement would terminate if mti purchases the property and equipment of spectek operations pursuant to the exercise of the above described options 
historically  during various reporting periods  spectek operations has had a significant positive impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
the expiration of the component recovery agreement  or the sale of the property and equipment of spectek operations to mti  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a substantial majority of the components used in spectek operations were obtained from mti under the former component recovery agreement 
in  and  the company obtained   and  respectively  of its components from mti s semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
additionally  in fiscal  the company obtained approximately of its components from mti s joint venture affiliates 
many semiconductor manufacturers other than mti are reluctant to sell nonstandard memory components because such components could compete with their full specification memory components for similar applications 
in addition  some manufacturers are concerned that subsequent testing performed by a recovery operation could reveal proprietary data regarding manufacturing yields and processes 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to negotiate future purchases of components on terms acceptable to the company after expiration of the component recovery agreement 
pricing of memory products pricing for spectek operations semiconductor memory products fluctuates  to a large degree  based on industry wide pricing for semiconductor memory products 
historically  the company has experienced significant declines in the average selling prices of its spectek operations semiconductor memory products as industry wide average selling prices for full specification semiconductor memory products experienced sharp declines 
the company believes that such declines in average selling prices of semiconductor memory products were due primarily to changes in the balance of supply and demand for these commodity products and changes in relative weakness or strength of certain currencies  and the company is unable to predict the impact of semiconductor memory product market dynamics in future periods 
due to increased market risk associated with holding purchased memory components in inventory  the company has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  losses from write downs of memory component inventories in periods of declining prices 
further declines in pricing for semiconductor memory products would likely result in declines in average selling prices of spectek operations semiconductor memory products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
memory product transition the semiconductor memory industry is characterized by  among other things  rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and enhancements  difficulties experienced in transitioning to new products  relatively short product life cycles and volatile market conditions 
during periods of product transition  spectek operations has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  significant increases in component test times and corresponding decreases in throughput 
future gross margins could be adversely affected if the company is unable to effectively transition to new products in a timely fashion 
exclusive sales representative agreement effective september   the company and micron semiconductor products  inc msp  a subsidiary of mti  entered into an exclusive sales agreement the sales agreement under which msp will serve as exclusive sales representatives for spectek operations memory products 
the failure of msp to perform its obligations under the sales agreement  including but not limited to the sale of all spectek operations memory products  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a
