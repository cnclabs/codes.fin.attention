item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year issue 
dependence on the condition of the airline industry 
aircraft engine and engine parts pricing is affected to a degree by the overall economic condition of the airline industry  which has historically been volatile 
the demand for after market engines and engine parts is driven primarily by flying hours or cycles 
regardless of the profitability of the airline industry  parts must be serviced or replaced at scheduled intervals 
as such  the demand for after market parts is a function of the level of worldwide air traffic 
additionally  factors such as the price of fuel affect the aircraft parts market  since older aircraft into which aircraft parts are most often placed become less economically viable as the price of fuel increases 
during a downturn in the aviation industry  there may be reduced overall demand for aircraft  avionics and aircraft rotables  and engines and engine parts  lower selling prices for the company s products and increased credit risk associated with doing business with industry participants 
there can be no assurance that economic and other factors that might affect the airline industry will not have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the aviation parts after market is highly competitive 
competition is based on product quality  price and the ability to provide needed parts quickly 
the largest segment of the after market is served by oems 
however  the relatively high overhead and slow response times often associated with such large organizations can present a handicap in a fast moving  price sensitive marketplace 
oems generally concentrate on selling new parts  leaving the market in serviceable and overhauled parts to other suppliers 
oem manufactured new parts generally do not compete with overhauled parts 
the largest resellers include companies such as aar corp 
and the ages group 
there are approximately to midsize resellers  including the company 
a large portion of the market revenue is generated by over small after market suppliers and brokers 
as a result of industry consolidation  management expects that a number of these smaller operators will either be acquired or will have difficulty competing in this changing market 
in addition  the engine parts supply business has been reshaped by the widespread adoption of ils the inventory locator service 
the ils lists the availability of thousands of types of parts from brokers  distributors  repair facilities and airlines 
the listing includes the quantity of parts available  the condition of the parts  when the parts are available and a contact for more information 
the ils has created a much freer flow of information concerning the supply and demand for particular parts 
dealers now must compete not only on the basis of their relationships with customers and knowledge regarding a potential source for products  but also on the quality of the parts available  the documentation tracing the history of the parts and the price 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to compete effectively against present and future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation 
the aviation industry is highly regulated by the faa in the united states and the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries 
while the company s reselling business is not regulated  the aircraft  avionics and aircraft rotables  and engines and engine parts that the company sells to its customers must be accompanied by documentation that enables the customer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that new and more stringent government regulations will not be adopted in the future or that any such new regulations  if enacted  would not have an adverse impact on the company 
before engine parts may be installed in an aircraft engine  they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the faa or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries 
specific regulations vary from country to country  although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with faa requirements 
engine components must also be traceable to sources deemed acceptable by such agencies 
although the company believes it complies with the highest level of such regulatory standards  standards may change in the future  requiring engine components already contained in the company s inventory to be scrapped or modified 
aircraft engine manufacturers may also develop new engine components to be used in lieu of engine components already contained in the company s inventory 
in all such cases  to the extent that the company has such engine components in its inventory  their value may be reduced and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
no dividends 
the company intends to retain all earnings for the foreseeable future for use in the operations and expansion of its business 
consequently  the company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its common stock to its stockholders for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the debt financing agreements to which the company is a party contain restrictions on the company s ability to declare dividends 
employees as of december   the company had approximately full time employees 
none of the company s employees are members of a labor union 
the company believes that its relations with its employees are good 
stock option plans corporate policy 
the company is operating in a unique environment where its relatively small number of employees consisting of executives and employees make the daily decisions that directly effect the company s operational and financial results 
the company continually strives to build and maintain a team comprised of the best executives and employees in their field by offering the most attractive work environment and performance based compensation packages available 
the board believes that the company s stock option plans are an essential component of the company s compensation package which promote the interests of the company and its stockholders by strengthening the company s ability to attract  retain and incentivize competent employees and executives and making service on the company s board of directors more attractive to present and prospective non employee directors 
such stock option plans encourage stock ownership and proprietary interest in the company by the individuals upon whose judgment  initiative and efforts the financial success and growth of the company largely depend 
stock option repricing and extension of vesting schedules 
in early october  the company faced a significant decline in the market price of its common stock  while financial and operating performance remained strong 
thus  a significant portion of the stock options previously issued to employees and non employee directors which were to vest that month  had exercise prices which exceeded the then current market value of the underlying shares 
in a special effort to fend off competitive pressures and reincentivize employees while securing their long term commitment to the company  the board approved the extension of the vesting schedule and the repricing of certain previously granted options in lieu of granting additional options to existing executives and employees 
the company offered all employees and directors of the company who held options which had been granted under the company s stock option plans the opportunity to exchange outstanding options having an exercise price above  the closing price of a share of common stock on october   for a corresponding number of options having an exercise price of 
the company also offered this opportunity to certain individuals who held options granted outside of the plans 
the company secured the long term commitment of employees and executives electing to exchange such options by requiring that the vesting schedules on the unvested portions of the new options would be extended by  in general  
as a result of this program  options to purchase approximately  shares  representing approximately of the outstanding common stock options were exchanged and vesting schedules extended 
in light of the repricing of stock options and extension of vesting schedules  the company believes its existing officers and employees are properly incentivized with long term commitments to the company 
therefore  it is the company s intent not to grant options to its current officers or employees until at least  and to thereby avoid any dilutive effect resulting from a full scale grant of options during stock option plan for new executives and employees and outside directors 
consistent with the corporate policy placing importance on stock options as part of compensation packages  the company intends to continue to use stock options as part of the performance based compensation packages used to attract and incentivize new executives and employees 
the company also intends to use stock options in lieu of cash compensation to continue to make service by present and prospective outside directors attractive 
for these reasons  the board adopted  subject to shareholder approval  a stock option plan the plan effective as of november  and intends to only grant options under this plan to newly hired executives and employees as an inducement to enter into employment arrangements with the company  and to outside members of the board  in lieu of cash compensation  as an incentive for their service on the board 
the plan authorizes the issuance of stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock and contains substantially the same terms as the company s stock option plan 
the company intends to seek shareholder approval of the plan at the annual meeting of shareholders

the company s management believes that free cash flow net income plus depreciation of property  plant and equipment and amortization of goodwill  combined with the company s syndicated credit facility should be sufficient for the company s current level of operations 
however  the company may elect to seek equity capital or other debt financing in the future depending upon market conditions and the capital needs of the company 
year issue the year problem is primarily the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such programs will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  including possible miscalculations  and a disruption in the operation of such systems 
this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the company and each of its operating subsidiaries are executing a plan to identify and address any possible business issues related to the impact of the year problem on both its information technology it and non it systems eg  embedded technology 
this plan addresses the year issue in multiple phases  including i determining an initial inventory of the company s systems  equipment including embedded technology in the company s aircraft  engine and parts inventory as well as leased equipment  vendors  customers and third party administrators that may be vulnerable to system failures or processing errors as a result of year issues  ii assessment and prioritization of inventoried items to determine risks associated with their failure to be year compliant  iii testing of systems and equipment to determine year compliance  iv remediation and implementation of systems and equipment  and v contingency planning to assess reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
as part of the company s plan  the company has retained a third party year solution provider to assist with a risk analysis of the company s year issue and assist with project office management 
for those systems which the company determines are not currently year compliant  implementation of the required changes is expected to be completed by september incremental costs  which include consulting costs and costs associated with internal resources to modify existing systems in order to achieve year compliance are charged to expense as incurred 
the company does not expect the cost of making the required system changes to exceed  the anticipated costs of the project and the dates on which the company believes it will complete the year modifications and assessments are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant systems 
with respect to the company s customers  suppliers and vendors  the company is in the process of contacting customers  suppliers and vendors to assess the potential impact on operations if such third parties are not successful in ensuring that their systems and operations are year compliant in a timely manner 
the company s year issues and any potential business interruptions  costs  damages or losses related thereto  are also dependent upon the year compliance of other third parties such as governmental agencies eg  federal aviation administration and foreign equivalents 
to date  the company is unable to determine whether it will be materially affected by the failure of any of its customers  suppliers  vendors or other third parties to be year compliant 
the company believes that its compliance efforts have and will reduce the impact on the company of any such failures 
failure of any third parties with which the company interacts to achieve year compliance could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk assessment  readiness evaluation  action plans and contingency plans related to the company s suppliers  vendors and other third parties are expected to be completed by september the company s risk management program includes emergency backup and recovery procedures to be followed in the event of failure of a business critical system 
these procedures will be expanded to include specific procedures for the potential year issue 
contingency plans to protect the company from year related interruptions are also being developed and are expected to be completed by september these plans will include development of backup procedures  identification of alternate suppliers  possible increases in inventory levels and other appropriate measures
