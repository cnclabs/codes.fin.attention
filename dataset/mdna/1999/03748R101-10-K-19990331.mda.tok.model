the company s management believes that ffo  less such a reserve  provides investors with an understanding of the company s ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains and losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company calculates ffo based on the nareit definition  as adjusted for minority interest in the aimco operating partnership  amortization of goodwill  the non cash deferred portion of the income tax provision for unconsolidated subsidiaries and less the payment of dividends on preferred stock 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as an indication of the company s performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s basis for computing ffo is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts 
for the years ended december   and  the company s ffo is calculated as follows amounts in thousands income before minority interest in operating partnership    extraordinary item gain on disposition of properties   real estate depreciation  net of minority interests    real estate depreciation related to unconsolidated entities   amortization of goodwill  amortization of recoverable amount of management contracts   deferred taxes   preferred stock dividends  preferred op unit distribution funds from operations ffo    weighted average number of common shares  common share equivalents and op units outstanding common stock    common stock equivalents  preferred stock convertible into common stock   op units    cash flow information cash flow provided by operating activities    cash flow used in investing activities    cash flow provided by financing activities    contingencies hud enforcement in october  nhp received a subpoena from the hud inspector general  which requested documents relating to any arrangement whereby nhp or any of its affiliates provides or has provided compensation to owners of hud multi family projects in exchange for or in connection with property management of a hud project 
aimco believes that other owners and managers of hud projects have received similar subpoenas 
documents provided by aimco to the hud inspector general relating to certain of nhp acquisitions of property management rights for hud projects may be responsive to the subpoena 
aimco believes that its operations are in compliance  in all material respects  with all laws  rules and regulations relating to hud assisted or hud insured properties 
effective february   counsel for aimco and the us attorney for the northern district of california entered into a tolling agreement related to certain civil claims the government may have against aimco 
although no action has been initiated against aimco or  to aimco s knowledge  any owner of a hud property managed by aimco  if any such action is taken in the future  it could ultimately affect existing arrangements with respect to hud projects  affect aimco s ability to receive clearances or otherwise have a material adverse effect on aimco s results of operations 
hud also has the authority to suspend or deny property owners and managers from participation in hud programs with respect to additional assistance within a geographic region through imposition of a limited denial of participation by any hud office or nationwide for violations of hud regulatory requirements 
year compliance general description of the year issue and the nature and effects of the year on information technology it and non it systems the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
over the past two years  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace significant portions of its software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications or replacements of existing software and certain hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed in time  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company s plan to resolve year issues involves four phases assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation 
to date  the company has fully completed its assessment of all information systems that could be significantly affected by the year  and has begun the remediation  testing and implementation phases on both hardware and software systems 
assessments are continuing in regards to embedded systems 
the status of each is detailed below 
status of progress in becoming year compliant  including timetable for completion of each remaining phase computer hardware during and  aimco identified all of the computer systems at risk and formulated a plan to repair or replace each of the affected systems 
during  when aimco merged with nhp  the mainframe system used by nhp was year compliant 
in august  the year compliant system became fully functional for the entire company 
in addition to the mainframe  pc based network servers  routers and desktop pcs were analyzed for compliance 
aimco has begun to replace each of the non compliant network connections and desktop pcs and  as of december   had completed approximately of this effort 
the total cost to replace the pc based network servers  routers and desktop pcs is expected to be approximately million  of which million has been incurred to date 
the remaining network connections and desktop pcs are expected to be upgraded to year compliant systems by march  computer software aimco utilizes a combination of off the shelf  commercially available software programs as well as custom written programs that are designed to fit specific needs 
both of these types of programs were studied  and implementation plans written and executed with the intent of repairing or replacing any non compliant software programs 
in  when aimco merged with nhp  the core financial system used by nhp was year compliant 
during  aimco integrated all of its core financial systems to this compliant system for general ledger and financial reporting purposes 
in  aimco determined that the software used for property management and rent collection was not year compliant 
during  aimco implemented a year compliant system at each of its owned or managed properties  at a cost of million 
during  aimco acquired properties and acquired the insignia multi family business 
insignia owned or managed  properties 
as properties are acquired  aimco converts the existing property management and rent collection systems to aimco s year compliant systems 
the estimated additional costs to convert such systems at all recently acquired properties  including those acquired from insignia  is  and the implementation and testing process is expected to be completed by march  the final software area is the office software and server operating systems 
aimco has upgraded all non compliant office software systems on each pc and has upgraded of the server operating systems 
the remaining server operating systems are planned to be upgraded to be year compliant by march operating equipment aimco has operating equipment  primarily at the property sites  which needed to be evaluated for year compliance 
in september  aimco began taking a census and inventory of embedded systems including those devices that use time to control systems and machines at specific properties  for example  elevators  heating  ventilating and air conditioning systems  security and alarm systems  etc 
the company has chosen to focus its attention mainly upon security systems  elevators  heating  ventilating and air conditioning systems  telephone systems and switches  and sprinkler systems 
while this area is the most difficult to fully research adequately  management has not yet found any major non compliance issues that put aimco at risk financially or operationally 
aimco intends to have a third party conduct an audit of these systems and report their findings by march  any of the above operating equipment that has been found to be non compliant to date has been replaced or repaired 
to date  these have consisted only of security systems and phone systems 
as of december   aimco has evaluated approximately of the operating equipment for year compliance 
the total cost incurred as of december  to replace or repair the operating equipment was approximately  aimco estimates the cost to replace or repair any remaining operating equipment is approximately  and aimco expects to be completed by april  aimco continues to have awareness campaigns throughout the organization designed to raise awareness and report any possible compliance issues regarding operating equipment within the enterprise 
nature and level of importance of third parties and their exposure to the year aimco continues to conduct surveys of its banking and other vendor relationships to assess risks regarding their year readiness 
aimco has banking relationships with three major financial institutions  all of which have indicated their compliance efforts will be complete before may aimco has updated data transmission standards with two of the three financial institutions 
aimco s contingency plan in this regard is to move accounts from any institution that cannot be certified year compliant by june  the company does not rely heavily on any single vendor for goods and services  and does not have significant suppliers and subcontractors who share information systems with the company external agents 
to date  the company is not aware of any external agent with a year compliance issue that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year compliant 
management does not believe that the inability of external agents to complete their year remediation process in a timely manner will have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
however  the effect of non compliance by external agents is not readily determinable 
costs to address year the total cost of the year project is estimated at million and is being funded from operating cash flows 
to date  the company has incurred approximately million million expensed and million capitalized for new systems and equipment related to all phases of the year project 
of the total remaining project costs  approximately million is attributable to the purchase of new software and operating equipment  which will be capitalized 
the remaining million relates to repair of hardware and software and will be expensed as incurred 
risks associated with the year management believes it has an effective program in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
as noted above  the company has not yet completed all necessary phases of the year program 
in the event that the company does not complete any additional phases  certain worst case scenarios could occur 
the worst case scenarios include elevators  security and heating  ventilating and air conditioning systems that read incorrect dates and operate with incorrect schedules eg  elevators will operate on monday as if it were sunday 
although such a change would be annoying to residents  it is not business critical 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also adversely affect the company 
the company could be subject to litigation for  among other things  computer system failures  equipment shutdowns or a failure to properly date business records 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
contingency plans associated with the year the company has contingency plans for certain critical applications and is working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds and selecting new relationships for such activities as banking relationships and elevator operating systems 
inflation substantially all of the leases at the company s apartment properties are for a period of six months or less  allowing  at the time of renewal  for adjustments in the rental rate and the opportunity to re lease the apartment unit at the prevailing market rate 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effect of inflation and the company does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on its revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates 
the company is not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk  or any other material market rate or price risks 
the company uses predominantly long term  fixed rate and self amortizing non recourse debt in order to avoid the refunding or repricing risks of short term borrowings 
the company uses short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund acquisitions and generally expects to refinance such borrowings with proceeds from equity offerings or long term debt financings 
the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december   which represents of the company s total outstanding debt 
based on this level of debt  an increase in interest rates of would result in the company s income and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
as of march   approximately of the company s indebtedness bears interest at variable rates 
at december   the company had  million of fixed rate debt outstanding  of which debt in an aggregate amount of million  million  million  million and million will mature in the years    and  respectively 
from time to time  the company enters into interest rate lock agreements to obtain what the company considers advantageous pricing for future anticipated debt issuances 
the estimated aggregate fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents  receivables  payables and short term secured and unsecured debt as of december  is assumed to approximate their carrying value due to their relatively short terms 
management further believes that  after consideration of interest rate agreements  the fair market value of the company s secured tax exempt bond debt and secured long term debt approximates their carrying value  based on market comparisons to similar types of debt instruments having similar maturities
