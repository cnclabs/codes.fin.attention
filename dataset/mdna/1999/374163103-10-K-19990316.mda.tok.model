item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview geron is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on discovering and developing therapeutic and diagnostic products based upon the company s understanding of human embryonic stem cells and of telomeres and telomerase in cells fundamental biological platforms underlying cancer and other age related degenerative diseases 
the company s results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and will continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under various collaborative agreements 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this report on form k 
on march   the company completed a private placement with two institutional investors for the sale of  shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock the series a preferred stock with a par value of and a stated value of  per share resulting in proceeds of million 
the series a preferred stock is convertible into the number of shares of common stock of the company equal to the stated value plus a premium of per annum divided by a conversion price 
the premium on the series a preferred stock is accreted and treated as a dividend 
the premium has been accrued through december  with the offsetting charge recorded to accumulated deficit 
the conversion price of the series a preferred stock is based on the market price of the common stock during a pricing period preceding conversion  up to a conversion price cap of 
the series a preferred stock is subject to redemption at the company s option if the market price of the common stock exceeds or falls below certain thresholds 
on november    shares of series a preferred stock were converted into  shares of geron common stock 
the number of shares of common stock issued in november met the maximum threshold of shares of common stock that can be issued without obtaining stockholder approval under nasd regulations 
because the company had not obtained stockholder approval to issue additional shares of common stock as of december   the remaining  shares of series a preferred stock with a book value of million are redeemable at the option of the holders of the series a preferred stock  have been reclassified as redeemable convertible preferred stock and are excluded from stockholders equity 
in addition  the premium on the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock will be accreted to the value of the outstanding series a preferred stock 
in accordance with the stock purchase agreement with pharmacia upjohn  spa  in march  pharmacia upjohn purchased million of geron common stock  at a premium 
on december   the company entered into an agreement to sell million in convertible zero coupon debentures to investment funds managed by three institutional investors 
the debentures are convertible at any time by the holders at a fixed conversion price of per share 
one half of the proceeds were funded upon signing the agreement and the remaining million will be funded upon the registration of the underlying common stock 
the debentures convert at the company s option when the common stock has traded at a certain premium to the fixed conversion price for five consecutive trading days 
in december  the company recorded approximately  in interest expense in connection with this financing for the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of the debentures 
an additional  in interest expense is expected to be recorded upon the funding of the remaining million of convertible debentures in in connection with the issuance of the convertible debentures  the company also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the warrants are exercisable at any time through june the value of the warrants was determined to be approximately  the proceeds of million from the issuance of the debentures were allocated between the debentures and the warrants 
the convertible debentures  which were recorded at a discount  are being accreted to the redemption amount over the three year term using the interest method 
warrants to purchase  additional shares of common stock at per share will be issued upon the funding of the remaining million of convertible debentures in geron is subject to risks common to companies in its industry and at its stage of development  including risks inherent in its research and development efforts  reliance upon collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on the company s research  it will be necessary for geron and collaborators to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of the company s product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
the company does not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years 
see additional factors that may affect future results 
results of operations revenues the company recognized revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal revenues in were research support payments under the company s collaborative agreements with pharmacia upjohn spa pharmacia upjohn and kyowa hakko kogyo co  ltd 
kyowa hakko 
revenues in decreased from as a result of reduced research funding from kyowa hakko as contractually agreed 
revenues in also included a one time payment by boehringer mannheim for reimbursement of past research efforts 
revenues in were research support payments from kyowa hakko 
the company recognizes revenue as the related research and development costs are incurred under the collaborative agreements 
annual funding payment of million was received under the kyowa hakko agreement in fiscal payments of million each were received from kyowa hakko in fiscal and  respectively 
funding payments totaling million and million were received under the pharmacia upjohn agreement in fiscal and  respectively 
the company expects to receive an aggregate of million from the pharmacia upjohn collaboration in the company receives license payments and royalties from license and marketing agreements with various diagnostic collaborators 
no license fee payments were received in or in fiscal  the company received  in royalties on the sale of diagnostic kits to the research use only market from oncor intergen  kyowa medex  boehringer mannheim roche diagnostics and pharmingen compared to  received in fiscal in fiscal  upon entering into a license and marketing agreement with kyowa medex  the company received a  license fee payment from kyowa medex 
in fiscal  the company received  in royalties from oncor and kyowa medex 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily a result of increased personnel costs of  for additional scientific staff 
the increase in from was primarily due to increased costs for expanded patent related activities of  and increases in support of key outside collaborators of  the company expects research and development expenses to increase significantly in the future as a result of continued development of its therapeutic and diagnostic programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily a result of increased personnel costs of approximately  for additional administrative personnel and bonus accruals 
in addition  also experienced increases in public and investor relations expense of  legal  accounting and consulting fees of  supplies and expensed office equipment of  and other taxes and filing fees of  the slight decrease in from was the net effect of a decrease in personnel costs of  as a result of departures of administrative personnel and an increase in public and investor relations expense of  interest and other income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in and were due to higher average cash and investment balances as a result of the sale of debt and equity securities and research funding received under the kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn collaborative agreements 
interest earned in the future will depend on the company s funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
the company also received   and  in research payments under government grants for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company does not expect income from government grants to substantially increase in the future 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in december  the company recorded approximately  in interest expense in connection with the sale of convertible debentures  for the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of the debentures 
the convertible debentures  which are recorded at a discount  are being amortized to the redemption amount over the three year term using the interest method 
the increase in was due to an increase in bank charges during the year as a result of higher cash and short term investment balances 
interest and other expense in is expected to be consistent with as the company expects to record an additional  in interest expense upon the funding of the remaining million of convertible debentures in net loss net losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net loss for was primarily the result of increased operating expenses during the year and lower research support payments from kyowa hakko 
the decrease in net loss for was the net result of increased revenue from research support payments from the pharmacia upjohn  kyowa hakko and boehringer mannheim collaborative agreements which more than offset the increase in operating expenses during the year 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  it is the company s investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  corporate notes  commercial paper and municipal securities 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments in was the result of sale of convertible preferred stock in march and the sale of convertible debentures in december the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments in was the net result of increased operating expenses and increased research funding support payments during the year 
net cash used in operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the slight decrease in net cash used in operations from to was the net result of increased non cash expenses and an increase in operating expenses in the decrease in net cash used in operations from to was due to an increase in research support payments as a result of funding under the pharmacia upjohn collaborative agreement entered into in the company expects that its net cash used in operations may increase in due to increased research and development expenditures 
the company has funded its operations primarily through public and private debt and equity financings 
the company has also received additional funding from collaborative agreements  grant revenues  interest income and equipment financing 
in january  pharmacia upjohn made an initial equity investment of million in geron at a premium 
in april and march  pharmacia upjohn purchased an aggregate of million million at each date of geron common stock at a premium 
research support payments from kyowa hakko expired in april as contractually agreed 
geron will have to expend its own funds to continue the research 
the company will seek additional funding through other strategic collaborations  public or private equity financing  or other financing sources 
cash provided by financing activities in also included net proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock of million and net proceeds of million from the issuance of convertible debentures and warrants 
on march   the company completed a private placement with two institutional investors for the sale of  shares of series a preferred stock with a stated value of  per share resulting in proceeds of million 
in november   shares of series a convertible preferred stock were converted into  shares of geron common stock 
the number of shares of common stock issued in november met the maximum threshold of shares of common stock that could be issued without obtaining stockholder approval under nasd regulations 
because the company had not obtained stockholder approval to issue additional shares of common stock as of december   the remaining  shares of series a preferred stock with a book value of million are redeemable at the option of holders of series a preferred stock  have been reclassified as redeemable convertible preferred stock and are excluded from stockholders equity 
in addition  the premium on the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock will be accreted to the value of the outstanding series a preferred stock 
on december   the company entered into an agreement to sell million in convertible zero coupon debentures to investment funds managed by three institutional investors 
the debentures are convertible at any time by the holders at a fixed conversion price of per share 
one half of the proceeds were funded upon signing the agreement and the remaining million will be funded upon the registration of the underlying common stock 
the debentures convert at the company s option when the common stock has traded at a certain premium to the fixed conversion price for five consecutive trading days 
in december  the company recorded approximately  in interest expense in connection with this financing for the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of the debentures 
an additional  in interest expense is expected to be recorded upon the funding of the remaining million of convertible debentures in through december   the company had invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through equipment financing 
minimum annual payments due under the equipment financing facility are expected to total    and  in   and  respectively 
as of december   the company had approximately million available for borrowing under its equipment financing facility 
the drawdown period under the equipment financing facility expires on july  the company intends to renew the commitment for a new equipment financing facility in to further fund purchases of equipment 
if the company is unable to renew the commitment  then the company will need to expend its own resources 
the company maintains agreements with academic and research institutions to fund certain scientific research 
minimum annual payments due under these agreements are expected to total approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the company intends to continue to maintain and develop relationships with academic and research institutions 
the company estimates that its existing capital resources  payments under the pharmacia upjohn collaborative agreement  proceeds to be received under convertible debentures in  interest income and equipment financing will be sufficient to fund its current and planned operations through the end of the year there can be no assurance  however  that changes in the company s research and development plans or other changes affecting the company s operating expenses will not result in the expenditure of available resources before such time  and in any event  the company will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund its operations in future periods 
the company intends to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  capital lease transactions or other financing sources that may be available 
additional factors that may affect future results before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that there are various risks  including those described below 
you should carefully consider these risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this form k  before you decide whether to purchase shares of our common stock 
some of the information in this prospectus contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  and continue or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition  or state other forward looking information 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control 
the risk factors listed in this section  as well as any cautionary language in this prospectus  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors and elsewhere in this form k could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our technology is new and we may not be able to develop products successfully 
the study of the mechanisms of cellular aging and cellular immortality  including telomere biology and telomerase  and the study of embryonic stem cells are relatively new areas of research 
while our development efforts are at different stages for different products  we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop any products or that we will not abandon some or all of our proposed research programs 
in the long term  for any of our cancer treatments or other discoveries to be proven commercially viable  we will need to demonstrate to the health care community that the treatment or products are safe  effective  reliable  and not subject to other problems that would affect commercial viability 
if and when potential lead drug compounds or product candidates are identified through our research programs  they will require significant preclinical and clinical testing prior to regulatory approval in the united states and elsewhere 
in addition  we will also need to determine whether any of these potential products can be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost 
our efforts may not result in a product that can be marketed 
because of the significant scientific  regulatory and commercial milestones that must be reached for any of our research programs to be successful  any program may be abandoned  even after significant resources have been expended 
our cancer treatment research may not result in commercially viable therapeutic products 
as a result of our drug discovery efforts to date  we have identified compounds in laboratory studies that demonstrate potential for inhibiting telomerase in humans 
however  additional development efforts will be required before we select a lead compound for preclinical development and clinical trials as a telomerase inhibitor for cancer 
we will have to conduct additional research before we can select a compound and we may never identify a compound that will enable us to fully develop a commercially viable treatment for cancer 
if and when selected  a lead compound may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics affecting its safety or effectiveness that may prevent or limit its commercial use 
in terms of safety  our discoveries may result in cancer treatment solutions that cause unacceptable side effects for the human body 
our discoveries may also not be as effective as is necessary to market a commercially viable product for the treatment of cancer 
for example  we expect that telomerase inhibition may have delayed effectiveness as telomeres resume normal shortening 
as a result  telomerase inhibition may need to be used in conjunction with other cancer therapies 
accordingly  it may become extremely difficult for us to proceed with preclinical and clinical development  to obtain regulatory approval or to market a telomerase inhibitor for the treatment of cancer 
if we abandon our research for cancer treatment for any of these reasons or for other reasons  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
our research related to the treatment of age related degenerative diseases may not result in commercially viable therapeutic products 
the research resulting from our telomerase activation and expression program has shown us that the activation of telomerase can extend cell lifespan in normal human cells 
while telomere length and replicative capacity have been extended in laboratory studies  we may not discover a compound that will modulate telomere length or increase replicative capacity effectively for clinical use 
we have yet to identify any lead compounds that have been demonstrated to modulate gene expression in human cells and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to discover or develop the necessary compound 
our cancer diagnostic program may not result in commercially viable clinical products 
there is  as yet  insufficient clinical data to confirm the full utility of our proprietary telomerase detection technology to diagnose  prognose  monitor patient status and screen for cancer 
although intergen  roche diagnostics  kyowa medex and pharmingen  our licensees  have begun to sell kits for research use  additional development work and regulatory consents will be necessary prior to the introduction of tests for clinical use 
our research related to embryonic stem and germ cells may not result in commercially viable clinical products 
our embryonic stem cell therapies program is also at an early stage 
while human embryonic stem cells have been derived and allowed to expand and differentiate into numerous cell types  our efforts to direct differentiation of human embryonic stem cells and develop products from our research may not result in any commercial applications 
we have a history of operating losses and anticipate future losses  continued losses could impair our ability to sustain operations 
we have incurred net operating losses every year since our operations began in losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years as our research and development efforts and preclinical testing activities are expanded 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been research support payments under the collaborative agreements with kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn 
research support payments under the agreement with kyowa hakko expired in april research payments under the agreement with pharmacia upjohn expire in january we are unable to estimate at this time the level of revenue to be received from the sale of diagnostic products  and do not expect to receive significant revenues from the sale of research use only kits 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on our ability  alone or with others  to continue to have success with our research and development efforts  select therapeutic compounds for development  obtain the required regulatory approvals  and manufacture and market resulting products 
we cannot assure you when or if we will receive material revenues from product sales or achieve profitability 
failure to generate significant additional revenues and achieve profitability could impair our ability to sustain operations 
we depend on our current collaborative partners to help us complete the process of developing  testing and commercializing our products 
our strategy for the development  clinical testing and commercialization of our products requires entering into collaborations with corporate partners  licensors  licensees and others 
we are dependent upon the subsequent success of these other parties in performing their respective responsibilities and the continued cooperation of our partners 
we cannot assure you that our partners will cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
we cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators resources that will be devoted to our research activities related to our collaborative agreements with them 
our collaborators may choose to pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
our ability to successfully develop and commercialize telomerase inhibition products depends on our corporate partnerships with kyowa hakko and pharmacia upjohn and our ability to successfully develop and commercialize telomerase diagnostic products depends on our corporate partnership with roche diagnostics 
under our collaborative agreements with these partners  we rely significantly on them  among other activities  to design and conduct advanced clinical trials  fund research and development activities with us  pay us fees upon the achievement of milestones  and co promote with us any commercial products that result from our collaborations 
the development and commercialization of products from these collaborations will be delayed if kyowa hakko  pharmacia upjohn or roche diagnostics fail to conduct these collaborative activities in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  kyowa hakko  pharmacia upjohn or roche diagnostics could terminate these agreements and we cannot assure you that we will receive any development or milestone payments 
if we do not receive research funds or achieve milestones set forth in the agreements  or if kyowa hakko  pharmacia upjohn or roche diagnostics or any of our future partners breach or terminate collaborative agreements with us  our business may be damaged significantly 
we are also  to a lesser extent  dependent upon collaborative partners other than kyowa hakko  pharmacia upjohn and roche diagnostics 
for example  we have entered into licensing arrangements with several diagnostic companies for our telomerase detection technology 
however  because these licenses are limited to the research use only market  such arrangements are not expected to generate significant commercial revenues  if at all 
our ability to develop  manufacture and market products is dependent upon whether we are successful in entering into additional collaborative partnerships 
we currently have no manufacturing infrastructure and no marketing or sales organization 
as a result  we intend to rely almost entirely on our current and future collaborative partners for the manufacture of any product and the principal marketing and sales responsibilities for any such product 
to the extent that we choose not to or are unable to establish such arrangements  we will require substantially greater capital to develop our own manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate additional strategic arrangements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  or that any potential strategic arrangement will be successful 
in the absence of such arrangements  we may encounter significant delays in introducing any product or find that the research  development  manufacture  marketing or sale of any product is adversely affected 
in the event we need to enter into strategic arrangements in the future  but are unable to do so  our business will be significantly and negatively impacted 
we have limited control over the research activities of our scientific advisors on which we rely 
we rely extensively and have relationships with scientific advisors at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at our request 
these scientific advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these advisors and  except as otherwise required by our collaboration and consulting agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
if our scientific advisors are unable or refuse to contribute to the development of any of our potential discoveries  our ability to generate significant advances in our technologies will be significantly harmed 
our success is dependent upon our ability to protect our discoveries 
the sustainability of our business is dependent on our ability to protect our discoveries with patents and enforce our patents 
protection of our proprietary compounds and technology is critically important to our business 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce our patents and maintain trade secrets  both in the united states and in other countries 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  including ours  are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions for which legal principles are not firmly established 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to develop products or processes that are patentable or that patents will issue from any of the pending applications  including allowed patent applications 
further  we cannot assure you that our current patents  or patents that issue on pending applications  will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that our current or future patent rights will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents  our business would be negatively impacted 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue 
publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by at least several months and sometimes several years 
therefore  we cannot assure you that the persons or entities that we or our licensors name as inventors in our patents and patent applications were the first to invent the inventions disclosed in the patent applications or patents  or file patent applications for these inventions 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain patents from discoveries that we otherwise would consider patentable and that we consider to be extremely significant to our future success 
patent prosecution or litigation may also be necessary to obtain patents  enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of another 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in any patent prosecution or litigation 
patent prosecution and litigation in general can be extremely expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome in a patent prosecution  litigation or any other proceeding in a court or patent office could subject our business to significant liabilities to other parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties or require us to cease using such technology 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents or otherwise protecting our discoveries  we will be dependent on our ability to develop alternative patentable technologies  avoid infringing on the patents of others  and license from others the patents that are necessary 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of others 
we cannot assure you that our technologies do not and will not infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
in the event of such infringement  we may be prevented from pursuing research  development or commercialization of potential products or may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or other proprietary rights or to develop or obtain alternative technologies 
we may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain any such license or alternative technologies  we may be delayed or prevented from pursuing the development of some potential products 
our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain alternative technologies or a license to any technology that we may require to develop or commercialize our products will significantly and negatively affect our business 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or litigation as a result of entering into license agreements with third parties or infringing on the patents of others 
for example  we signed a licensing and sponsored research agreement relating to our embryonic stem cell therapies program with the johns hopkins university school of medicine in august prior to signing this agreement  we had been informed by a third party that we and johns hopkins university would violate the rights of that third party and another academic institution in doing so 
after a review of the correspondence with the third party and johns hopkins university  as well as related documents  including an issued us patent  we believe that both we and johns hopkins university have substantial defenses to any claims that might be asserted by the third party 
we have provided indemnification to johns hopkins university relating to such potential claims 
however  any litigation resulting from this matter may divert significant resources  both financial and otherwise  from our research programs 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful if the matter is litigated 
if the outcome of litigation is unfavorable to us  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
patent law relating to the scope and enforceability of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving  and the degree of future protection for any of our proprietary rights is highly uncertain 
in this regard we cannot assure you that independent patents will issue from any of our patent applications  some of which include many interrelated applications directed to common or related subject matter 
as a result  our success may become dependent on our ability to obtain licenses for using the patented discoveries of others 
we are aware of patent applications and patents that have been filed by others with respect to telomerase and telomere length technology and we may have to obtain licenses to use this technology 
for example  there are a number of issued patents and pending applications owned by others directed to differential display  stem cell and other technologies relating to our research  development and commercialization efforts 
we may also become aware of discoveries and technology controlled by third parties that is advantageous to our other research programs 
we cannot assure you that our discoveries and treatments can be further developed and commercialized without a license to these discoveries or technologies 
moreover  other patent applications may be granted priority over patent applications that we or any of our licensors have filed 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  duplicate any of our technologies or design around the patented technologies we have developed 
in the event that we are unable to acquire licenses to critical technologies that we cannot patent ourselves  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop similar technology  and we may not be successful in this regard 
if we cannot acquire or develop necessary technology  we may be prevented from pursuing some of our business objectives 
moreover  one of our competitors could acquire or license such technology 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business 
much of the information and know how that is critical to our business is not patentable and we may not be able to prevent others from obtaining this information 
we rely extensively on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology  especially in circumstances in which patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or obtainable 
we attempt to protect our proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and contractors 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors  any of which would harm our business significantly 
we will need additional capital to conduct our operations and develop our products  and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain 
we will require substantial capital resources in order to conduct our operations and develop our products 
based on current projections  we estimate that our existing capital resources  payments under our agreement with pharmacia upjohn  proceeds to be received under convertible debentures in  interest income and equipment financing will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through the end of the timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs in and beyond  continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs  our ability to maintain and establish strategic arrangements for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  our progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  and the potential for new technologies and products 
we intend to acquire additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings and capital lease transactions 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
additional equity financings could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
further  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners  such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are in a highly competitive market and our competitors may develop alternative technologies that may impair our ability to sustain operations 
the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive 
we believe that other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms of cell aging and cell immortality  including the study of telomeres  telomerase and stem cell technologies 
in addition  other products and therapies that could compete directly with the products that we are seeking to develop and market currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and by academic and other research organizations 
many companies are also developing alternative therapies to treat cancer and  in this regard  are competitors of ours 
the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
there is also competition for access to libraries of compounds to use for screening 
should we fail to secure and maintain access to sufficiently broad libraries of compounds for screening potential targets  our business would be materially harmed 
in addition to the above factors  we expect to face competition in the following areas product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory consents  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
as a result of the foregoing  our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than us 
most significantly  competitive products may render our products that we develop obsolete 
our success is dependent on our ability to retain key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers and key members of our scientific staff 
the loss of any or all of these individuals could damage our business and might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research  development or business objectives 
we also rely on consultants and advisors  including the members of our scientific advisory board  who assist us in formulating our research and development strategy 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
we may not be able to attract and retain such individuals on acceptable terms 
failure to do so would adversely affect our business 
the ethical  legal and social implications of the embryonic stem cell therapies program could prevent us from developing commercially viable products in this area 
our embryonic stem cell therapies program involves the use of human embryonic stem and germ cells that would be derived from human embryonic or fetal tissue  respectively 
the use of human embryonic stem and germ cells gives rise to ethical  legal and social issues regarding the appropriate utilization of these cells 
in the event that our research related to human embryonic stem and germ cell therapies becomes the subject of adverse commentary or publicity  our name and goodwill could be adversely affected 
we have established an ethics advisory board comprised of independent and recognized medical ethicists to advise us with respect to these issues 
indeed  the use of embryonic cells in scientific research is an issue of national interest 
many research institutions  including several of our scientific collaborators  have adopted policies regarding the ethical use of these types of human cells 
these policies may have the effect of limiting the scope of research conducted in this area 
the united states government currently does not fund research that involves the use of human embryonic cells or tissue and may in the future regulate or otherwise restrict its use 
the embryonic stem cell therapies program would be significantly harmed if we are prevented from conducting research on these cells due to government regulation or otherwise 
our ability to earn revenues from the sale of marketable products is partly dependent on the scope of government regulation and our success in obtaining regulatory approval for our products 
our business is subject to intense government regulation and this regulation may significantly impact our ability to create and market commercially viable products 
federal  state and local governments in the united states and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern many of our activities 
the preclinical testing and clinical trials of the products that we develop ourselves or that our collaborative partners develop are subject to intense government regulation and may prevent us from creating commercially viable products from our discoveries 
in addition  the sale by us or our collaborative partners of any commercially viable product will be subject to government regulation from several standpoints  including the processes of manufacturing  labeling  selling  distributing  marketing  advertising  and promoting 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with these regulations for any of our potentially marketable products 
to the extent that we are unable  our ability to earn revenues will be significantly and negatively impacted 
the regulatory process  particularly for biopharmaceutical products like ours  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any product that we or our collaborative partners develop must receive all relevant regulatory agency approvals or clearances  if any  before it may be marketed in the united states or other countries 
generally  biological drugs and non biological drugs are regulated more rigorously than medical devices 
in particular  human pharmaceutical therapeutic products  including a telomerase inhibitor  are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements by the food and drug administration in the united states and similar health authorities in foreign countries 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product in order to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
see business government regulation in our form k for an extensive description of the approval steps for biopharmaceutical products 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory agency approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development and or the period of review of any application for regulatory agency approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory agency approvals or clearances could significantly harm the marketing of any products that we or our collaborative partners develop  impose costly procedures upon our activities or the activities of our collaborative partners  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborative partners may attain  or adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
even if we commit the time and resources  both economic and otherwise  that are necessary  the required regulatory agency approvals or clearances may not be obtained for any products developed by or in collaboration with us 
if regulatory agency approval or clearance for a new product is obtained  such approval or clearance may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed that could limit the potential market for any such product 
furthermore  approved products and their manufacturers are subject to continual review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in severe civil and criminal penalties  including but not limited to recall or seizure of products  injunction against manufacture  distribution  sales and marketing  and criminal prosecution 
the imposition of any of these penalties could significantly impair our business 
the success of our products is dependent upon their acceptance in the health care community 
we cannot assure you that any products successfully developed by us or by our collaborative partners  if approved for marketing  will achieve market acceptance since physicians  patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and utilize these products 
the products that we are attempting to develop may represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our developed products will depend on a number of factors  including our establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our product candidates  our ability to create products that are superior to alternatives currently on the market  our ability to establish in the medical community of the potential advantage of our treatments over alternative treatment methods  and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors 
if the health care community does not accept our products for any of the foregoing reasons  our ability to generate revenues will be significantly impaired health care reform measures may negatively impact third party reimbursement for our products and prevent market acceptance of our products 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  including pharmaceuticals 
if we fail to generate adequate third party reimbursement for the users of our potential products and treatments  then we may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products  if any  will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  and pharmacy benefit management companies 
both federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals and other medical products may change or be adopted before any of our potential products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we may develop in the future 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services and any of our potential products and treatments may ultimately not be considered cost effective by these third parties 
any of these initiatives or developments could negatively impact our business 
improper use of hazardous materials could result in significant economic penalties and adversely affect our financial condition 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
as a consequence  we are subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations and may be adversely affected by the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  handling  storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  our use of these materials could be curtailed by state or federal authorities  and we could be held liable for any damages that result 
any such liability could materially adversely affect our business 
insurance may not be available to cover us in the event that we are exposed to product liability claims 
although we believe that we do not currently have any exposure to product liability claims  our future business will expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products 
we currently have no clinical trial liability insurance and we may not be able to obtain and maintain such insurance for any of our clinical trials 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
the substantial number of shares that will be eligible for sale in the near future may adversely affect the market price for our common stock and may result in significant dilution to our current stockholders 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market following this offering could significantly and negatively affect the market price for our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding approximately  shares of common stock 
we also have reserved  shares of common stock for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants and options that we issued to our employees and other entities 
the conversion of the all the debentures and exercise of the all the warrants will result in our issuance of a minimum of  shares of common stock 
if the series a debentures were converted on december   the series a debentures would be convertible into  shares of common stock 
similarly  the series b debentures will be convertible into  shares of common stock on their date of issuance if no adjustments in the conversion price have occurred before that date 
if the series a warrants were exercised on december   the series a warrants would be exercisable into  shares of common stock 
similarly  the series b warrants would be exercisable into  shares of common stock on their date of issuance if no adjustments in the exercise price have occurred before that date 
this number of shares could prove to be significantly greater  and you would be increasingly diluted  in the event that the conversion or exercise prices are reduced because we have a rights offering  or a similar offering of securities to all investors  at less than the conversion or exercise price per share respectively  or issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock  other than related to our option plans or in connection with a strategic joint venture  at a price less than the conversion price per share 
additionally  one of our current strategic partners and shareholders  pharmacia upjohn  has contractually agreed not to sell the  shares of common stock that it holds until april  at which time these shares will be eligible for sale and freely transferable in the public market 
we also continue to have  outstanding shares of our series a convertible preferred stock  which shares would be convertible into  shares of common stock as of december  in order for these shares to be converted  we would have to seek and obtain shareholder approval for the transaction or receive a waiver from the nasdaq national market 
current holders of our common stock will also be immediately and substantially diluted to the extent that the weighted average conversion and exercise price of the above described convertible and exercisable securities is less than the price of our common stock on the date holders of these securities convert or exercise their convertible or exercisable securities 
our stock price will likely be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
stock prices and trading volumes for many biopharmaceutical companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including some reasons which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your return on your investment 
historically  our stock price has been extremely volatile 
between january and january  our stock price traded as high as per share and as low as per share 
the significant market price fluctuations of our common stock are due to a variety of factors  including depth of the market for the common stock  the experimental nature of our prospective products  fluctuations in our operating results  market conditions relating to the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries  any announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products or clinical progress or lack thereof by us  our collaborative partners or our competitors  or announcements concerning regulatory developments  developments with respect to proprietary rights and our collaborations 
in addition  the stock market is subject to other factors outside our control that can cause extreme price and volume fluctuations 
securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies  including many biotechnology companies  which then experience volatility in the market price of their securities 
litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
our undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids  this may adversely affect the market price for our common stock and the voting rights of the holders of common stock 
our certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors with the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of these shares without further vote or action by the stockholders 
in march  the board of directors designated  shares as series a preferred stock 
as of december   the board of directors still has authority to designate and issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
the issuance of preferred stock may also result in the loss of voting control by others 
provisions in our charter and bylaws  and provisions of delaware law  may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us and may prevent changes in management 
in addition to the undesignated preferred stock  provisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management  including provisions that prevent stockholders from taking actions by written consent  require a staggered election of our board of directors  and set forth procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us 
for example  delaware law prevents delaware corporations  including us  from engaging in certain business combinations 
either collectively or individually  these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers  including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions 
potential year problems could adversely affect our operations 
potential year problems are the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or laboratory equipment that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions in operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send checks  perform research and development activities  or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on a recent assessment  we have determined that we will be required to modify or replace portions of our software so that our computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
these software programs include our accounting package and voicemail system 
we presently believe that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  potential year problems will not pose significant operational problems for our computer systems 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed timely  potential year problems could have a significant and negative impact on our operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about geron s market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of the geron s investments in marketable securities at december  was million 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
foreign currency exchange risk 
at this time  we participate in few foreign currency exchange activities  therefore  would not be subject to risk of gains or losses for changes in foreign exchange rates
