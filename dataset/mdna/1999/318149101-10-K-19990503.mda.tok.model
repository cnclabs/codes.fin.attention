receivables from broker dealers  which are primarily from our clearing broker  turn over rapidly 
as a securities dealer  we may carry significant levels of securities inventories to meet customer needs 
our inventory of market making securities is readily marketable  however  holding large blocks of the same security may limit liquidity and prevent realization of full market value for the securities 
securities owned  but not readily marketable  represent underwriter warrants and the securities underlying such warrants 
the liquidity of these securities is limited 
a relatively small percentage of our total assets are fixed 
the total assets or the individual components of total assets may vary significantly from period to period because of changes relating to customer demand  economic and market conditions  and proprietary trading strategies 
our brokerage subsidiaries  gkn  southeast and shochet  are subject to the net capital rules of the nasd and sec

in conjunction with our corporate headquarters relocation in new york  we have significantly upgraded our technological infrastructure 
the combined costs of the move and the technological investment were financed through a series of operating leases 
these leases total million 
as security for these leases  we arranged for a standby letter of credit 
as collateral for the standby letter of credit  we have placed million in a restricted cash escrow account with the provider 
we intend to use debt and lease financing prudently in the future 
our overall capital and funding needs are continually reviewed to ensure that our capital base can support the estimated needs of its business units 
these reviews take into account business needs as well as regulatory capital requirements of the subsidiaries 
based upon these reviews  management believes that our capital structure is adequate for current operations and reasonably foreseeable future needs 
during fiscal  we intend to offer a day trading service over the internet 
this new venture  in addition to others  may require us to raise additional capital 
other matters year computer issue we initiated a firm wide program to address the year computer issue in order to prepare our computer systems and applications for properly processing dates after december  this program consists of a series of steps to identify all critical non critical systems  determine yk compliance through inquiries and testing  and change non compliant systems 
our program is proceeding on schedule and it is our expectation that we will have our firm wide year solution substantially in place by july  we have completed our identification stage 
third party vendors and service providers provide all of our computer programs and services 
most of the programs were purchased after the year computer issue became widely recognized 
we have contacted approximately of our third party vendors and service providers and have received written confirmation from approximately of them that the year computer issue has been appropriately managed 
schroder  our clearing firm  is our largest and most important computer services related vendor 
schroder has provided us with assurances that it expects to appropriately manage the year computer issue on a timely basis 
the year computer issue creates a risk for us from unforeseen problems in our own computer systems  third party vendors and service providers  and from third parties with whom we deal worldwide 
we are continuing to communicate with our third party vendors and service providers to determine the likely extent to which we may be affected by third parties year plans and target dates 
in this regard  while we do not now expect material financial exposure as a result of the year problem  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other entities on which we rely will be remediated on a timely basis  or that a failure to remediate by another party  would not have a material adverse effect on us 
such failures could have a material impact on our ability to conduct business 
we are developing contingency plans in the event that significant external parties fail to achieve their year plans by the targeted dates 
we anticipate that beginning on january   year related failures may result in sporadic disruption of communications  power or other external infrastructure worldwide that could compromise the timely performance of specific business functions and or limit the flow of business opportunities accross the organization 
we intend to have contingency plans and crisis management teams in place to coordinate our response to those events likely to present material risks to us 
this process is currently underway  but there can be no assurance that any such contingency plans will fully mitigate the effects of any third party failure 
based on information currently available  we do not expect our year expenditures for to be a material cost to us 
to date  we have spent less than  and expect that the entire program will not exceed  the expected costs of the year program are based on management s current estimates  however  actual results could differ materially from those plans 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market making  investing and underwriting activities often involve the purchase  sale or short sale of securities as principal 
such activities subject our capital to significant risks from markets that may be characterized by relative illiquidity or may be particularly susceptible to rapid fluctuations in liquidity 
such market conditions could limit our ability to resell securities purchased or to purchase securities sold short 
these activities subject our capital to significant risks  including market  credit counterparty and liquidity risks 
market risk relates to the risk of fluctuating values based on market prices without action on our part 
our primary credit risk is settlement or counterparty risk  which relates to whether a counterparty will fulfill its contractual obligations  such as delivery of securities or payment of funds 
liquidity risk relates to our iniability to liquidate assets or redirect the deployment of assets contained in illiquid investments 
in addition  our market and liquidity risks and risks associated with asset revaluation are increased because these risks for us are concentrated and thus subject us to increased risks if market conditions
