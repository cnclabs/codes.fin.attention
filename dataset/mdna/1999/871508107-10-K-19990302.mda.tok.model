year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer systems may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in product and or system failures or other computer errors causing disruption of the company s operations 
the company has identified the following areas of risk a the failure or disruption of systems used by the company to run its business operations and facilities  b the failure or disruption of systems used by the company s suppliers and vendors  c warranty or other claims by customers due to failure or malfunctioning of the company s products 
the company has established a steering committee including senior executives to address year issues which will report periodically to the board of directors 
the company s plan to address year issues has resulted in the formation of three main teams a internal systems team  b product readiness team  and c external vendors suppliers team 
the company is currently implementing new computer systems that will substantially insure that the company s operating systems are not subject to year transition problems 
to the extent that current systems that will not be replaced have been determined to be non compliant  the company is working with the suppliers of such systems to obtain upgrades and or enhancements to insure year compliance 
to the extent such system implementation  replacement or modification is delayed or if significant new non compliance issues are identified or go undetected  the company s results of operations could be adversely impacted 
the company has initiated formal communications with all of its significant hardware and software suppliers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems and sources of supply are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
based on a recent assessment  the company believes that it will not be required to modify or replace significant portions of its product offerings so that such products will function properly with respect to dates in the year however  several year related issues  mostly stemming from third party operation systems  have been identified 
the company has undertaken measures to inform customers of year related issues via its year web site 
however  it is not possible to anticipate all end user situations and or year related issues  particularly those involving third party products 
the company may experience an increase in warranty and other claims related to year issues 
additionally  there may be substantial year litigation caused by failure of systems which contain company products or third party products sold by the company 
the impact of such warranty and or other claims may have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
in  the company expended less than  on external resources in connection with its year related activities 
capitalized spending for upgrading and replacing non compliant computer systems was approximately  for the year 
the company anticipates the total cost of its year activities to be approximately  through which includes approximately  of capitalized fixed assets 
based upon the company s current estimates  total incremental out of pocket costs of its year program are expected to be immaterial 
these costs are expected to be incurred primarily in fiscal and include third party consultants  remediation of existing computer software and hardware  and upgrading product offerings 
such costs do not include internal management time and the deferral of other projects  the effects of which are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company s total year project costs include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of third party year issues based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that other companies upon which the company relies will be able to timely address their year compliance issues  the effects of which may have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
at this stage of the process  the company believes that it is difficult to specifically identify the cause of the most reasonable worst case year scenario 
as is true for most manufacturers and distributors of products such as those sold by the company  a reasonable worst case scenario would be the failure of the company s products to operate properly through the millennium rollover causing customers systems and or operations that are dependent upon such products to fail or be disrupted 
in the event of such failures  customers may commence legal action against the company or otherwise seek compensation for their losses associated with such failures 
an additional worst case year scenario would be the failure of key vendors and or suppliers to have corrected their own year issues which could cause disruption of the company s operations and have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the impact of such disruption cannot be estimated at this time 
the company s contingency plans to address worst case year scenarios include developing or obtaining upgrades for its products that have been tested and found to be non compliant and in the event the company believes that any of its key suppliers are unlikely to be able to resolve their year issues  it will seek a second source of supply 
euro conversion as part of the european economic and monetary union emu  a single currency the euro will replace the national currencies of most of the european countries in which the company conducts business 
the conversion rates between the euro and the participating nations currencies have been fixed irrevocably as of january   with the participating national currencies being removed from circulation between january  and june  and replaced by euro notes and coinage 
during the transition period from january  through december   public and private entities as well as individuals may pay for goods and services using either checks  drafts  or wire transfers denominated in euro or the participating country s national currency 
under the regulations governing the transition to a single currency  there is a no compulsion  no prohibition rule which states that no one is obliged to utilize the euro until the notes and coinage have been introduced on january  in keeping with this rule  the company is euro compliant able to receive euro denominated payments and able to invoice in euro as requested by vendors and suppliers  respectively as of january  in the affected countries 
full conversion of all affected country operations to euro is expected to be completed by the time national currencies are removed from circulation 
phased conversion to the euro is currently underway and the effects on revenues  costs and various business strategies are being assessed 
the cost of software and business process conversion is not expected to be material 
market risk sensitivity the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
the company has a formal policy that prohibits the use of currency derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the policy permits the use of financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that may arise in the normal course of the company s business 
currently  the company does not use interest rate derivatives 
the counterparties in derivative transactions are major financial institutions with ratings of a or better  as determined by one of the major credit rating services 
the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in transactions denominated in foreign currencies  thereby limiting the company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
during  the principal transactions hedged were short term intercompany purchases 
the periods of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the hedged transactions 
gain and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts and the offsetting losses and gains on hedged transactions are reflected in the company s statement of earnings 
a large percentage of the company s sales are transacted in local currencies 
as a result  the company s international operating results are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against every applicable currency could have had a million impact on the net earnings of the company 
the company does not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge expected earnings 
the company  which manufactures nearly all of its products in the united states  generally invoices its international subsidiaries in their local currency for finished and semi finished goods 
as a result  the company s annual us dollar cash flow is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against every applicable currency could have had a million impact on the value of the realized cash remittances from its subsidiaries 
the company routinely uses foreign exchange contracts to hedge cash flows that are either firm commitments or those which may be forecasted to occur 
all of the company debt is us dollar denominated 
at year end  about percent of this indebtedness to third parties was floating rate based 
although the company has exposure to rising and falling rates  a percent rise in rates on the year end bank borrowings would have had a  adverse impact on net earnings 
the company does not use interest rate derivatives to protect its exposure to interest rate market movements
