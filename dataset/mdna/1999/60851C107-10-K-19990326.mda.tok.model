the company s systems have applications in many aspects of life science including the therapeutic development process  from drug discovery and clinical research through manufacturing and quality control 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues 
revenues for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in all three product families showed increased levels of revenue 
maxline revenues increased due to both greater sales of the new spectramax products addressing both the absorbance and fluorescence markets and increased penetration of maxline products into our european distribution channels 
cell analysis revenues increased due to both the introduction of new flipr products and increased flipr demand worldwide 
threshold revenues increased due to greater volume shipments to military customers worldwide 
revenues for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in the maxline and cell analysis product families showed increased levels of revenue 
maxline revenues increased primarily due to greater sales of new spectramax products and increased penetration of maxline products into international distribution channels 
cell analysis revenues increased primarily due to greater sales of new flipr products worldwide 
threshold revenues decreased primarily due to lower shipments to the us army and decreased shipments of commercial threshold products internationally 
gross margin 
gross margin increased to in from in this increase relates primarily to increased sales of new higher margin maxline and flipr products 
in  gross margin increased nominally to from in this increase relates primarily to increased sales of new higher margin maxline products and improved margins on sales of cell analysis products 
research and development 
research and development expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in this increased spending relates primarily to additional development expenses required to support the introduction of new maxline and flipr products including additional personnel 
research and development expenses for increased nominally by to approximately million from approximately million in the relatively flat spending in was due to increased spending on personnel  partially offset by decreased external product development costs

the company determined this amount to be in process research and development and recorded the charge based on  among other factors  the stage of development of each product acquired  the time and resources needed to complete product development  expected income and associated risks 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by to approximately million from approximately million in and by in compared to approximately million in the increased spending for both periods is primarily the result of additional spending on marketing  sales and service related activities including increased personnel as the company continued its efforts to expand worldwide market coverage and introduce new products

income tax provision 
income tax provisions of approximately million effective rate and approximately million effective rate were recorded in and  respectively 
the increased effective rate period to period is due primarily to anticipated decreased tax benefits from the company s foreign sales corporation 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded in the benefit recorded in  which had the effect of increasing net income  related primarily to a reduced valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax asset

net cash used in investing activities was approximately million   and million in  and  respectively  and was used primarily for capital expenditures  except for when approximately million of cash was used for the acquisition of noveltech 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and  respectively  for and  while net cash used in financing activities was approximately  for the and proceeds relate primarily to stock option exercises 
the use of funds reflects repayment of the million promissory note related to the acquisition of noveltech as partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises 
the company believes that existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund its operations for the foreseeable future 
however  the company s future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the resources the company devotes to developing  manufacturing and marketing its products  the extent to which the company s products generate market acceptance and demand  potential acquisition opportunities that may arise and other factors 
as such  there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing and  therefore  the company may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance the company has a year project in place to address the potential exposures related to the impact on its computer systems and scientific and manufacturing equipment containing computer related components for the year and beyond 
the company is currently assessing its internal and external year risks and continues to monitor  validate and implement the identified corrective actions 
the company s internal business systems have been reviewed and plans are being defined to achieve year compliance 
testing of the company s business critical application programs began in the fourth quarter of and is scheduled to be complete by the third quarter of any failure on the part of the company to identify and correct year compliance issues related to the company s internal business systems could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operation 
all of the company s products that are currently manufactured and supported are year compliant 
there is an installed base of company products no longer distributed that are not year compliant  all of which have an identified upgrade path which our customers can purchase to achieve compliance 
in addition to risks associated with the company s own computer systems  equipment and products  the company has relationships with  and is to varying degrees dependent upon  a large number of third parties that provide information  goods and services to the company 
these include financial institutions  suppliers  vendors  governmental entities  distributors and customers 
if significant numbers of these third parties experience failures in their computer systems or equipment due to year non compliance  it could affect the company s ability to process transactions  manufacture products  or engage in similar normal business activities 
while many of these risks are outside the control of the company  the company has instituted programs  including internal records review and use of external questionnaires  to identify key third parties  assess their level of year compliance and address any non compliance issues 
upon completion of this process  any required contingency plans will be developed 
at this time  the company believes there are no significant incremental costs anticipated to achieve both internal and external year compliance 
the total cost of the year systems assessments and conversions is being funded through operating cash flows and the company is expensing these costs as they are incurred 
however  there can be no assurances that the third parties of the company will be in compliance and the company has no control over whether such third parties will be in compliance with year requirements 
any failure on the part of the company s third parties  which could include inability to deliver or purchase product  could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
