operating income from continuing operations  which excludes realized investment gains and losses  was million in compared with million in and million in operating income in reflects a first quarter restructuring charge of million after taxes related to the implementation of a cost control initiative 
operating income in reflects a fourth quarter charge of million after taxes related to the write down of the carrying value of certain real estate assets 
income from continuing operations  which includes realized investment gains and losses related to such operations  was million in compared with million in and million in in may  the corporation completed the sale of its life and health insurance operations 
the life and health insurance operations have been classified as discontinued operations 
net income  which includes the results of the discontinued operations  amounted to million in compared with million in and million in property and casualty insurance property and casualty earnings were lower in compared with such earnings in were substantially higher than in property and casualty income after taxes was million in compared with million in and million in the decrease in earnings in was due to a decline in underwriting results caused in large part by substantially higher catastrophe losses 
investment income increased in compared with the prior year 
the increase in earnings in was due to highly profitable underwriting results as well as strong growth in investment income compared with earnings in were adversely affected by higher catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses were million in  million in and million in the amount was net of reinsurance recoveries of approximately million relating to hurricane georges 
we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance program during or since there were no individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded the initial retention 
our initial retention level for each catastrophic event is approximately million in the united states and generally million outside the united states 
reported net premiums written amounted to billion in  an increase of compared with reported net premiums written increased in compared with personal coverages accounted for billion or of premiums written and commercial coverages for billion or 
the reported growth in premiums written in and was affected by changes in certain reinsurance agreements  which are discussed below 
for many years  a portion of the us insurance business written by the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries was reinsured on a quota share basis with a subsidiary of the sun alliance group plc 
similarly  a subsidiary of the corporation assumed a portion of sun alliance s property and casualty business on a quota share basis 
effective january   the agreements pertaining to the exchange of reinsurance were amended to reduce the portion of each company s business reinsured with the other 
consequently  during  the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries retained a greater portion of the business they wrote directly and assumed less reinsurance from sun alliance 
as a result of the merger of sun alliance with royal insurance holdings plc  these agreements were terminated effective january  therefore  in  the property and casualty subsidiaries retained an even greater portion of the business they wrote directly and assumed no reinsurance from sun alliance 
there was an additional impact on net premiums written in the first quarter of and due to the effect of the portfolio transfers of unearned premiums as of january of each year resulting from the changes in retention 
a comparison of reported net premiums written with net premiums written adjusted to reflect the changes to the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance follows in millions reported net premiums written    premiums assumed from sun alliance net premiums written  excluding premiums assumed from sun alliance    portfolio transfers of unearned premiums adjusted net premiums written compared with   increase in retention adjusted net premiums written compared with   net premiums written  as adjusted  increased in compared with similarly  net premiums written  as adjusted  increased in compared with after a review of the costs and benefits of our casualty excess of loss reinsurance program  effective january   we modified the program  principally for the excess liability and executive protection classes 
the changes included an increase in the initial retention for each loss from million to million and an increase in the initial aggregate amount of losses retained for each year before reinsurance responds 
these changes in our casualty reinsurance program increased net premiums written in by approximately million compared with the prior year 
during  we continued to evaluate the relative costs and benefits of the program 
as a result  effective january   we again modified the program  increasing the initial retention for each loss from million to million 
this change in our casualty reinsurance program increased net premiums written in by approximately million compared with these changes have had a positive impact on the cash flows and resulting investment income of the property and casualty subsidiaries 
premium growth in personal lines was strong in both and in commercial lines  intense competition in the worldwide marketplace has made profitable premium growth difficult  particularly in the standard classes  which include multiple peril  casualty and workers compensation 
in  competitors continued to place significant pressure on pricing as they attempted to maintain or increase market share 
in an environment where price increases have been difficult to achieve  we have focused on our specialty lines where we emphasize the added value we provide to our customers 
strong growth was achieved in both years in premiums outside the united states  particularly in europe  our largest foreign market 
in view of the continuing unprofitability of the standard commercial classes  we have accelerated actions to achieve price increases 
our priorities for are to renew good business at adequate prices and not renew underperforming accounts where we cannot attain price adequacy 
this aggressive pricing strategy could cause us to lose some business 
therefore  we expect overall premium growth to be flat in underwriting results were near breakeven in compared with profitable results in and the combined loss and expense ratio  the common measure of underwriting profitability  was in compared with in and in the loss ratio was in compared with in and in the loss ratio continues to reflect the favorable experience resulting from the consistent application of our disciplined underwriting standards 
losses from catastrophes represented percentage points of the loss ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in the significant catastrophes affecting results in included the winter ice storms in canada in the first quarter  the wind and hail storms in the united states in the second quarter and hurricane georges in puerto rico in the third quarter 
catastrophe losses in resulted primarily from the winter storms in the eastern part of the united states in the first quarter 
our expense ratio was in compared with in and in the increase in the ratio in was due primarily to an increase in commission expense caused in part by higher contingent payments and also to written premiums growing at a somewhat lesser rate than overhead expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  we began an activity value analysis process to identify and eliminate low value activities and to improve operational efficiency in order to reduce expenses and redirect resources to those current activities and new initiatives having the greatest potential to contribute to the future results of the corporation 
implementation began in the first quarter of and is substantially completed 
this cost control initiative has resulted in approximately job reductions in the home office and the branch network through a combination of early retirements  terminations and attrition 
other savings involve vendor management  consulting expenses and other operating costs 
the initiative is expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately million  beginning in in the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  or million after taxes  related to the implementation of the cost control initiative 
the restructuring charge relates primarily to costs associated with providing enhanced pension benefits to employees who accepted an early retirement incentive offer  severance costs and other costs 
personal insurance reported premiums from personal insurance increased in compared with a increase in the effect on net premiums written of the changes to the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance was as follows in millions reported net premiums written    portfolio transfers of unearned premiums adjusted net premiums written compared with   increase in retention adjusted net premiums written compared with   net premiums written  as adjusted  increased in compared with and in compared with we continued to grow our homeowners and other non automobile business in non catastrophe prone areas while maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing and risk selection 
personal automobile premiums grew as a result of an increase in the number of in force policies for high value automobiles 
our personal insurance business produced substantial underwriting profits in each of the past three years 
the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in the profitability of our homeowners business each year is affected substantially by the amount of catastrophe losses we incur 
homeowners results were profitable by a similar margin in and as a reduction in the frequency of non catastrophe related losses in substantially offset an increase in catastrophe losses 
results for this class were unprofitable in as catastrophe losses  particularly those caused by the winter storms  adversely affected results 
catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in our automobile business produced substantial profits in each of the last three years 
results in each year benefited from stable loss frequency and severity 
other personal coverages  which include insurance for personal valuables and excess liability  were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
personal excess liability profitability increased in due to favorable loss experience but decreased somewhat in due to an increase in the frequency of large losses 
commercial insurance reported premiums from commercial insurance were virtually unchanged in compared with reported premiums in were higher than in the effect on net premiums written of the changes to the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance was as follows in millions reported net premiums written    portfolio transfers of unearned premiums adjusted net premiums written compared with   increase in retention adjusted net premiums written compared with   net premiums written  as adjusted  increased in compared with and in compared with our strategy of working closely with our customers and our ability to differentiate our products have enabled us to renew a large percentage of our business 
growth was achieved in in our executive protection business due to an emphasis on new products 
financial services consolidation together with competition has constrained growth in our financial institutions business 
premium growth in the standard commercial classes continues to be hindered by the intense competition that has driven prices to increasingly unprofitable levels 
premium growth in for the excess liability component of our casualty coverages and for our executive protection coverages benefited from the changes to our casualty excess of loss reinsurance program 
premium growth in and was stronger outside the united states 
our commercial insurance business produced unprofitable results in compared with near breakeven underwriting results in and the combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in and in multiple peril results were unprofitable in each of the past three years due  in large part  to inadequate prices 
results for this class in deteriorated in the property component due to higher catastrophe losses 
in the liability component  there was an increase in the frequency of large losses in however  this was offset by negligible multiple peril incurred losses in relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago compared with the substantial incurred losses in relating to such claims 
results for the multiple peril class were similar in and as an improvement in in the property component  due in part to an absence of catastrophe losses  was offset by higher losses in the liability component resulting from an increase in the frequency of large losses and higher incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
catastrophe losses represented percentage points of the loss ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in results for our casualty business were similarly unprofitable in each of the past three years 
in each year  casualty results were adversely affected by incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims  but more so in the excess liability component of our casualty coverages was slightly unprofitable in compared with profitable results in and due to declining prices and an increase in the frequency of losses 
excess liability results in benefited from favorable development on certain case reserves set up several years ago 
results for the primary liability component were unprofitable in each of the past three years  but more so in and due to a higher frequency of losses in those years 
results in the automobile component were more unprofitable in than in compared with breakeven results in the deterioration in and again in was due to an increase in the frequency of large losses 
workers compensation results were unprofitable in each of the past three years 
results deteriorated in and again in due in large part to the cumulative effect of price reductions over the past several years 
results were also adversely affected in by several large losses 
property and marine results were unprofitable in and  but more so in  compared with profitable results in results in and were adversely affected by an increase in the frequency of large losses  including several large overseas losses 
results in all three years were adversely affected by catastrophe losses 
catastrophe losses for this class represented percentage points of the loss ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in executive protection results were highly profitable in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience  particularly in the directors and officers and fiduciary components 
our financial institutions business was also profitable during the same period due to the favorable loss experience in the fidelity component of this business 
such profitability was somewhat lower in due to several large losses in the non fidelity portion of this business 
our other commercial classes produced near breakeven results in compared with profitable results in and near breakeven results in the deterioration in was attributable to our aviation business  which produced highly unprofitable results 
the improvement in was primarily attributable to our surety and accident business 
reinsurance assumed reinsurance assumed is treaty reinsurance that was assumed from sun alliance 
the reinsurance agreement with sun alliance was terminated effective january  however  due to the lag in our reporting of such business  net premiums written in the first quarter of included million related to business we assumed from sun alliance in the second half of net premiums written for this segment were reduced by million and million in the first quarter of and  respectively  due to the effect of the portfolio transfers of unearned premiums back to sun alliance as of january of each year 
underwriting results for this segment in  which represent our share of the sun alliance business for the last six months of  were near breakeven 
underwriting results were also near breakeven in loss reserves loss reserves are our property and casualty subsidiaries largest liability 
at the end of  gross loss reserves totaled billion compared with billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
reinsurance recoverable on such loss reserves was billion at year end compared with billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
as a result of the changes to the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance  there were portfolio transfers of gross loss reserves and reinsurance recoverable as of january  and the effect of these portfolio transfers was a decrease in gross loss reserves of million and million and a decrease in reinsurance recoverable of million and million in and  respectively 
loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by million or in compared with million or in excluding the effect of the portfolio transfer  net loss reserves increased by million or in substantial reserve growth has occurred each year in those liability classes  primarily excess liability and executive protection  that are characterized by delayed loss reporting and extended periods of settlement 
during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
this compares with favorable development of million in and million in such redundancies were reflected in operating results in these respective years 
each of the past three years benefited from favorable claim severity trends for certain liability classes  this was offset each year in varying degrees by losses incurred relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the higher favorable development in compared with the prior years was due to substantially lower incurred losses related to asbestos and toxic waste claims  the continued favorable loss experience for executive protection coverages and favorable development on certain excess liability case reserves set up several years ago 
the process of establishing loss reserves is a complex and imprecise science that reflects significant judgmental factors 
this is true because claim settlements to be made in the future will be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions  changing legislative  judicial and social environments and changes in our claim handling procedures 
in many liability cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss and the settlement of the loss 
in fact  approximately of our net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr claims that had not yet been reported to us  some of which were not yet known to the insured  and for future development on reported claims 
judicial decisions and legislative actions continue to broaden liability and policy definitions and to increase the severity of claim payments 
as a result of this and other societal and economic developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience continue to further complicate the already complex loss reserving process 
the uncertainties relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago are exacerbated by inconsistent court decisions and judicial and legislative interpretations of coverage that in some cases have tended to erode the clear and express intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
our most costly asbestos exposure relates to an insurance policy issued to fibreboard corporation by pacific indemnity company in in  pacific indemnity company  a subsidiary of the corporation  entered into a global settlement agreement with continental casualty company a subsidiary of cna financial corporation  fibreboard corporation  and attorneys representing claimants against fibreboard for all future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard 
this agreement is subject to final appellate court approval 
pursuant to the global settlement agreement  a billion trust fund will be established to pay future claims  which are claims that were not filed in court before august  pacific indemnity will contribute approximately million to the trust fund and continental casualty will contribute the remaining amount 
in december  upon execution of the global settlement agreement  pacific indemnity and continental casualty paid their respective shares into an escrow account 
upon final court approval of the settlement  the amount in the escrow account  including interest earned thereon  will be transferred to the trust fund 
all of the parties have agreed to use their best efforts to seek final court approval of the global settlement agreement 
pacific indemnity and continental casualty reached a separate agreement in for the handling of all asbestos related bodily injury claims pending on august  against fibreboard 
pacific indemnity s obligation under this agreement with respect to such pending claims is approximately million  all of which has been paid 
the agreement further provides that the total responsibility of both insurers with respect to pending and future asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard will be shared between pacific indemnity and continental casualty on an approximate and basis  respectively 
at the same time  pacific indemnity  continental casualty and fibreboard entered into a trilateral agreement to settle all present and future asbestos related bodily injury claims resulting from insurance policies that were  or may have been  issued to fibreboard by the two insurers 
the trilateral agreement will be triggered if the global settlement agreement is ultimately disapproved 
pacific indemnity s obligation under the trilateral agreement is therefore similar to  and not duplicative of  that under those agreements described above 
the trilateral agreement reaffirms portions of an agreement reached in march between pacific indemnity and fibreboard 
among other matters  that agreement eliminates any pacific indemnity liability to fibreboard for asbestos related property damage claims 
in july  the united states district court of the eastern district of texas approved the global settlement agreement and the trilateral agreement 
the judgments approving these agreements were appealed to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
in july  the fifth circuit court affirmed the judgments of the district court 
the objectors to the global settlement agreement appealed to the united states supreme court 
in june  the supreme court set aside the ruling by the fifth circuit court that had approved the global settlement agreement and ordered the fifth circuit court to reconsider its approval 
in january  the fifth circuit court again affirmed the global settlement agreement 
in april  the objectors to the settlement petitioned the supreme court to review the decision 
in december  argument was held before the supreme court on the objectors challenge 
a decision is expected during the trilateral agreement was never appealed to the united states supreme court and is final 
as a result  management continues to believe that the uncertainty of pacific indemnity s exposure with respect to asbestos related bodily injury claims against fibreboard has been eliminated 
since  a california court of appeal has agreed  in response to a request by pacific indemnity  continental casualty and fibreboard  to delay its decisions regarding asbestos related insurance coverage issues that are currently before it and involve the three parties exclusively  while the approval of the global settlement is pending in court 
continental casualty and pacific indemnity have dismissed disputes against each other which involved fibreboard and were in litigation 
we have additional potential asbestos exposure  primarily on insureds for which we wrote excess liability coverages 
such exposure has increased due to the erosion of much of the underlying limits 
the number of claims against such insureds and the value of such claims have increased in recent years due in part to the non viability of other defendants 
our remaining asbestos exposures are mostly peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers and distributors of certain products that contain asbestos as well as premises owners 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
we continue to receive notices of new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims as more peripheral parties are drawn into litigation to replace the now defunct mines and bankrupt manufacturers 
hazardous waste sites are another significant potential exposure 
under the federal superfund law and similar state statutes  when potentially responsible parties prps fail to handle the clean up  regulators have the work done and then attempt to establish legal liability against the prps 
the prps  with proper government authorization in many instances  disposed of toxic materials at a waste dump site or transported the materials to the site 
most sites have multiple prps 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
pollution was not a recognized hazard at the time many of these policies were written 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically exclude such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up have become substantial  prps and others have increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is great uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  notwithstanding continued pressure by the insurance industry and other interested parties to achieve a legislative solution which would reform the liability provisions of the law  congress has not yet addressed the issue 
it is currently not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
the superfund law does not address non superfund sites 
for that reason  it does not cover all existing hazardous waste exposures  such as those involving sites that are subject to state law only 
there remains significant uncertainty as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
litigation costs remain substantial  particularly for hazardous waste claims 
a substantial portion of the funds we have expended to date has been for legal fees incurred in the prolonged litigation of coverage issues 
primary policies provide a limit on indemnity payments but many do not limit defense costs 
this unlimited defense provided in the policy sometimes leads to the payment of defense costs in multiples of the indemnity exposure 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
we have established case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves have been established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
these reserves are continually reviewed and updated 
we have evaluated ultimate incurred losses using newly emerging techniques for estimating environmental liabilities and have expanded our claim data base 
as a result  we are more confident about the range of likely ultimate incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
therefore  the incurred losses relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims were only million in  substantially less than the million in and the million in further increases in such loss reserves in and future years are possible as legal and factual issues concerning these claims continue to be clarified 
the amount cannot be reasonably estimated 
management believes that the aggregate loss reserves of the property and casualty subsidiaries at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses which had occurred  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
in establishing such reserves  management considers facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and the legislatures in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  particularly as they relate to asbestos and toxic waste claims  as well as the uncertainty in determining what scientific standards will be deemed acceptable for measuring hazardous waste site clean up  additional increases in loss reserves may emerge which would adversely affect results in future periods 
the amount cannot reasonably be estimated at the present time 
catastrophe exposure the corporation s property and casualty subsidiaries have an exposure to insured losses caused by hurricanes  earthquakes  winter storms  windstorms and other catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe prone areas and develop strategies to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
in recent years  we have invested in modeling technologies that allow us to better monitor catastrophe exposures 
we also continue to explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our potential exposure under insurance policies 
investments and liquidity investment income after taxes increased in compared with in growth was primarily due to increases in invested assets  which reflected strong cash flow from operations over the period  partially offset by lower average yields on new investments 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate increased in and then decreased in due to changes in the percentage of our investment income subject to tax 
generally  premiums are received by our property and casualty subsidiaries months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
these funds are used first to make current claim and expense payments 
the balance is invested to augment the investment income generated by the existing portfolio 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to the corporation 
new cash available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately million in compared with  million in and  million in new cash in and included approximately million and million  respectively  received as the net result of the portfolio transfers of unearned premiums and loss reserves as of january of each year related to the changes to the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance 
new cash in also included million received in january as a result of the commutation of a stop loss reinsurance agreement related to medical malpractice unpaid claims arising from business written prior to in  new cash was invested primarily in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
in  new cash was invested in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  in the first quarter of  million of foreign denominated bonds were sold due to the reduction in foreign liabilities resulting from the termination of the reinsurance agreements with sun alliance  with the proceeds invested in us dollar denominated securities 
in  we invested new cash primarily in mortgage backed securities and tax exempt bonds 
in each year  we tried to achieve the appropriate mix in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain sufficient investments in highly liquid  short term securities at all times to provide for immediate cash needs and the corporation maintains bank credit facilities that are available to respond to unexpected cash demands 
corporate investment income earned on corporate invested assets and interest and other expenses not allocable to the operating subsidiaries are reflected in the corporate segment 
corporate income after taxes was million in compared with million in and million in the increase in corporate income in was due primarily to a reduction in interest expense 
the lower corporate income in was due primarily to an increase in interest expense 
real estate in october  we announced that we were exploring the possible sale of all or a significant portion of our real estate assets 
in march  our real estate subsidiary entered into an agreement with a prospective purchaser to perform due diligence in anticipation of executing a contract for the sale of substantially all of its commercial properties 
because the plan to pursue the sale of these assets in the near term represented a significant change in circumstances relating to the manner in which these assets would be used  we reassessed the recoverability of their carrying value as of december  as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of million  or million after taxes  in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
in june  a definitive agreement was reached with the purchaser 
in november  the sale of almost all of the properties covered by the agreement reached in june was closed for million  which included million in cash and the assumption of million in debt 
the buyer is a joint venture formed by paine webber real estate securities inc  morgan stanley real estate fund ii  lp and gale wentworth  lp closing on the one remaining property under the agreement is expected to occur in in addition to the sale to the joint venture in november  we sold several other commercial properties as well as residential properties in and we are continuing to explore the sale of certain of our remaining properties 
we have retained approximately million of land which we expect will be developed in the future 
in addition  we have retained approximately million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease 
real estate operations resulted in a loss after taxes of million in compared with losses of million in and million in the loss in reflects the million after tax impairment charge 
excluding the impact of the impairment charge  results in benefited from the sale of several rental properties 
revenues were million in  million in and million in revenues in reflect the reduced operating activity as a result of the sale of a substantial portion of our real estate assets in revenues in included million from the november sale of real estate properties 
proceeds received from that sale that related to mortgages receivable are not classified as revenues 
revenues in included higher levels of revenues from residential development and the sale of rental properties 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires that we analyze our individual buildings  leased land and development sites on a continuing basis to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
estimates are made of the revenues and operating costs  plus any additional costs to be incurred to complete development  of the property in the future through an assumed holding period based on our intended use of the property 
the time value of money is not considered in assessing whether an impairment has occurred 
if it is determined that impairment has occurred  measurement of such impairment is based on the fair value of the assets 
the million writedown of real estate assets in was made in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
loans receivable  which were issued in connection with our joint venture activities and other property sales  are primarily purchase money mortgages 
such loans  which amounted to million at december   are generally collateralized by buildings and  in some cases  land 
we continually evaluate the ultimate collectibility of such loans and establish appropriate reserves 
the carrying value of the real estate assets we plan to dispose of in the near term is based on the estimated fair value of these assets 
the recoverability of the carrying value of the remaining real estate assets is assessed based on our ability to fully recover costs through a future revenue stream 
the process by which sfas no 
is applied and necessary write downs are calculated assumes these properties will be developed and disposed of over a period of time 
the assumptions reflect a continued improvement in demand for office space  an increase in rental rates and the ability and intent to obtain financing in order to hold and develop such remaining properties and protect our interests over the long term 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
however  if the assets are not sold or developed as presently contemplated  it is possible that additional impairment losses may be recognized 
real estate activities were funded in the past with short term credit instruments  primarily commercial paper  and debt issued by chubb capital corporation as well as with term loans and mortgages 
proceeds from the november sale were used to repay the outstanding short term debt and certain term loans and mortgages as well as to reduce intercompany borrowings from chubb capital 
in february  the remaining million of intercompany borrowings from chubb capital was converted into preferred stock of the real estate subsidiary 
in  the interest rate on the remaining term loan approximated and for mortgages the range of interest rates was to 
investment gains and losses net investment gains realized by the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries were as follows in millions equity securities fixed maturities realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax decisions to sell securities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
thus  realized investment gains and losses may vary significantly from year to year 
sales of equity securities in each of the last three years resulted in net realized investment gains due primarily to the significant appreciation in the united states equity markets 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
fixed maturities which the corporation and its insurance subsidiaries have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
the remaining fixed maturities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  are classified as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value 
at december   of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity compared with at december  and at december  the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments carried at market value  which includes equity securities and fixed maturities classified as available for sale  is reflected in a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
the unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in unrealized market appreciation of fixed maturities were due to fluctuations in interest rates 
discontinued operations life and health insurance in may  the corporation completed the sale of chubb life insurance company of america to jefferson pilot corporation for million in cash  subject to various closing adjustments  none of which were material 
in  the corporation recognized a loss of million relating to the sale of the life and health insurance operations 
the purchase price was not adjusted to reflect results of operations subsequent to december  the discontinued life and health insurance operations did not affect the corporation s net income in and and will not affect net income in future periods 
earnings in from the discontinued life and health insurance operations were million  including realized investment gains of million 
market risk the main objectives in managing the investment portfolios of the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risks related to financial instruments of the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries primarily relate to the investment portfolio  which exposes the corporation to risks related to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
we view these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries 
the table on the following page provides information about all our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
fixed maturities expected cash flows of principal amounts at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions tax exempt    average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities    average interest rate mortgage backed securities   average interest rate total      at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions tax exempt    average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities    average interest rate mortgage backed securities   average interest rate total    the corporation and its property and casualty subsidiaries have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
as a result  we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk 
taxable bonds in our domestic portfolio comprise us treasury  government agency  mortgage backed and corporate securities 
during  to increase our investment returns  we shifted a portion of the taxable portfolio from government agency mortgage backed securities and lower yielding us treasury securities to commercial mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds 
approximately of taxable bonds are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  approximately are rated aa or better with more than half rated aaa 
only of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
taxable bonds have an average maturity of years while tax exempt bonds mature on average in years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life and the effective yield of a security 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly and invest primarily in those classes of mortgage backed securities that are less subject to prepayment risk 
mortgage backed securities comprised of our taxable bond portfolio at both year end and about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
an additional of our mortgage backed securities were call protected aaa rated commercial securities 
the remaining mortgage backed holdings were all investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since their business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which we have unpaid claims and other liabilities 
such investments have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held foreign investments of billion supporting their international operations 
such foreign investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling 
the table below provides information about those fixed maturity investments included in the table on page that are denominated in these two currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  and actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
foreign currency denominated fixed maturities expected cash flows of principal amounts at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions canadian dollar british pound sterling at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions canadian dollar british pound sterling equity price risk is the potential loss arising from changes in the value of equity securities 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our equity securities are high quality and readily marketable 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio 
year readiness disclosure the year issue relates to the inability of certain information technology it systems and applications as well as non it systems  such as equipment with imbedded chips and microprocessors  to properly process data containing dates beginning with the year the issue exists because many systems used two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such systems may recognize the date as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities or other unforeseen problems 
in  we initiated a project to ensure year readiness of the corporation s systems and applications 
we put in place a team responsible for bringing our systems and equipment into year compliance 
the team performed an inventory and assessment of our mainframe systems to determine which must be retired  renovated or rewritten as a result of year issues 
as of december   we completed remediation and testing procedures on of our mainframe it systems  including all mission critical systems except one 
we expect to complete the remediation and testing of all remaining systems by june we have also completed an inventory and assessment of all our personal computers  servers and other non mainframe computers 
we expect that all such computers and related software will be year ready by the third quarter of we have also assessed our non it systems and believe that the failure of any of these systems would have minimal impact on our operations 
the corporation and its subsidiaries have interaction with many third parties  including producers  reinsurers  financial institutions  vendors  suppliers and others 
we have initiated contact with these parties regarding their plans for year readiness 
we are in the process of evaluating the responses and following up with those parties from whom we have received no response 
the information obtained will be used to develop business contingency plans to address any mission critical operations that may be adversely impacted by the noncompliance of a third party with whom we interact 
we have electronic data interchanges with some third parties 
we are physically testing such interchanges for year compliance 
we expect that such testing will be completed by june we have identified those third parties that are critical to our operations and are assessing risks with respect to the potential failure of such parties to be year ready 
however  we do not have control over these third parties and are unable to determine whether all such third parties will address the year issue successfully  including third parties located outside the united states where it is believed that year remediation efforts in general may be less advanced 
management cannot determine the effect on the corporation s future operating results of the failure of third parties to be year ready 
our year plans have been developed with the intention of minimizing the need for actual implementation of contingency activities 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of will be used to monitor systems already remediated for year for any unidentified problems and to perform additional remediation and testing as necessary 
nonetheless  in order to address any unexpected difficulties that may arise  we will keep our core year readiness team intact until june additionally  we are studying the development of contingency plans to continue business in the unlikely event that one or more of our critical systems fail 
we believe that we are taking the necessary measures to address year issues that may arise and that our internal systems will be compliant 
notwithstanding such efforts  significant year problems could arise 
in particular  the prolonged failure of power and telecommunications systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
similarly  year related difficulties experienced by our producers or financial institutions have the potential to materially disrupt our business 
given the uncertain nature of year problems that may arise  management cannot determine at this time whether the consequences of year related problems will have a material impact on the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
the year team has included employees of the corporation and software consultants 
a portion of the remediation effort has been accomplished by redirecting existing systems resources to the year effort 
however  we do not believe that this has had a significant adverse effect on other systems initiatives 
we expect that the cost to address the year it systems issue  including compensation of employees and the cost of consultants  will approximate million 
approximately million was incurred as of december   of which million was incurred in these amounts do not include the cost of computer equipment purchased to replace equipment that would have been upgraded in the normal course of business  but not necessarily prior to january an additional concern to the corporation is the potential future impact of the year issue on insurance coverages written by our property and casualty subsidiaries 
the year issue is a risk for some of our insureds and needs to be considered during the underwriting process similar to any other risk to which our customers may be exposed 
it is possible that year related losses may emerge that would adversely affect operating results in future periods 
at this time  in the absence of any significant claims experience  management cannot determine the nature and extent of any losses  the availability of coverage for such losses or the likelihood of significant claims 
the euro on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european economic and monetary union adopted the euro as their common currency  at which time the rates of conversion between the euro and the participating national currencies were fixed 
the euro will be introduced gradually over a period of three years 
during this transition period  business in the participating countries will be conducted in the euro or the national currency 
once the national currencies are phased out  the euro will be the sole legal currency in these countries 
we have identified the systems and operational issues related to the impact of the adoption of the euro on our european property and casualty operations 
we were prepared to transact euro denominated business as of january  we will address additional systems issues over the three year transition period 
the adoption of the euro is not expected to have a material effect on the corporation s financial position or results of operations

currently  we expense all development costs of internal use computer software 
sop is effective for the corporation on january  and is to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sop will increase the corporation s net income in by an amount that has not yet been quantified 
the effect on net income will decrease in future years as the new method of accounting is phased in
