item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition year issue below for additional discussion 
business of the nonutility companies the activities of the nonutility companies are described below 
for edison international s business segment information for each of the years ended december    and  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in edison international s annual report to shareholders incorporated by reference in this report 
edison mission energy eme  primarily through its subsidiary corporations  is engaged in the business of developing  acquiring  owning  and operating electric power generation facilities worldwide 
as of december   eme subsidiaries held interests in domestic and international operating power production facilities with an aggregate power production capability of  mw  of which  mw are attributable to eme s interests 
these operating facilities are located in california  florida  nevada  new jersey  new york  virginia  washington  west virginia  australia  spain  and the united kingdom 
in addition  facilities aggregating more than  mw  of which eme s anticipated share is approximately  mw  are in the construction stage 
eme also has a pending acquisition of a interest in a  mw facility 
eme owns interests in oil and gas producing operations and related facilities in various us locations 
eme s activity in the asia pacific region commenced in december with the acquisition of a interest of the  mw loy yang b power station loy yang b from the state government of victoria state  australia s first electric privatization effort 
in may  a subsidiary of eme acquired the state s interest in loy yang b 
the first of two mw units at loy yang b began commercial operations in october unit commenced commercial operations in october an eme affiliate provides operations and maintenance services for both units 
in april  eme and its partners  mitsui co 
ltd  general electric corporation and pt batu hitam perkasa  an indonesian limited liability company  commenced construction of the billion paiton project  a  mw coal fired power plant in east java  indonesia 
the project will consist of two units  each of which is expected to have a capacity of mw  with commercial operation expected in in january  eme purchased an additional interest in the paiton project from general electric corporation  thereby increasing its ownership interest to 
construction on the two unit paiton project is nearing completion with commercial operation expected in the tariff is higher in the early years and steps down over time 
the tariff for the paiton project includes infrastructure to be used in common by other units at the paiton complex 
the plant s output is fully contracted with the state owned electricity company  pt perusahaan listrik negara pln 
payments are in indonesian rupiah  with the portion of such payments intended to cover non rupiah project costs including returns to investors indexed to the indonesian rupiah us dollar exchange rate established at the time of the power purchase agreement in february pln s payment obligations are supported by the government of indonesia 
the projected rate of growth of the indonesian economy and the exchange rate of indonesian rupiah into us dollars have deteriorated significantly since the paiton project was contracted  approved and financed 
the project received substantial finance and insurance support from the export import bank of the united states  the export import bank of japan  the us overseas private investment corporation and the ministry of international trade and industry of japan 
the paiton project s senior debt ratings have been reduced from investment grade to speculative grade based on the rating agencies perceived increased risk that pln might not be able to honor the electricity sales contract with paiton 
the government of indonesia has arranged to reschedule sovereign debt owed to foreign governments and has entered into discussions about rescheduling sovereign debt owed to private lenders 
pln has recently announced its intentions to commence discussions with independent power producers to renegotiate the power supply contracts  however it is not yet known what form the negotiation may take 
any material modifications of the contract could also require a renegotiation of the paiton project s debt agreement 
the impact of any such renegotiations with pln  government of indonesia or the project s creditors on eme s expected return on its investment in paiton is uncertain at this time  however  management believes that it will ultimately recover its investment in the project 
kwinana is a million  mw gas fired cogeneration project located at the british petroleum kwinana refinery near perth  australia 
the project  which is owned by eme  began commercial operations in december the project supplies electricity to western power formerly the state electricity commission of western australia and both electricity and steam to the british petroleum kwinana refinery 
in july  eme  through its indirect  wholly owned subsidiary  purchased a interest in tri energy  a mw gas fired power plant under construction in the ratchaburi province  thailand 
commercial operation is expected in mid eme s operating projects in the european region are the first hydro project located in north wales  the roosecote project in northwest england  the derwent project located in derby  england and the iberian hy power projects which consist of small  hydroelectric facilities in spain 
iberian hy power i was acquired in december  and iberian hy power ii was acquired in august in january  eme purchased the remaining equity stake in iberian hy power amsterdam  bv  increasing its ownership percentage to approximately minority interests are owned in three of the projects by third parties 
in december  eme purchased all of the outstanding shares of first hydro company first hydro for approximately billion million pounds sterling 
first hydro s principal assets are two pumped storage electric power stations located in north wales at dinorwig and ffestiniog  which have a combined capacity of  mw 
the dinorwig station  which was commissioned in  comprises six units totaling  mw 
the ffestiniog station was commissioned in and comprises four units totaling mw 
first hydro is an independent generating company with three main sources of revenue i selling power into the electricity trading market or pool in england and wales  ii providing system support services to the national grid company plc  and iii selling its installed capacity forward by entering into contracts for differences with large electricity suppliers 
in june  eme ownership and its partner  isab spa ownership  signed a year power purchase contract with enel spa  italy s state electricity corporation  pursuant to which enel spa will purchase mw of output from the mw isab power project  which is located near siracusa in sicily  italy 
the project will employ gasification technology to convert heavy oil residues from the isab refinery in priolo gargallo into clean burning syngas that will be used to generate electricity in a combustion turbine 
the approximately two trillion italian lira us billion project financial closing was completed in april  with construction commencing in july commercial operation is expected in late in february  eme ownership signed a shareholders agreement to develop the million doga enerji as project in esenyurt  near istanbul  turkey 
the mw combined cycle  gas fired cogeneration facility is expected to commence commercial operations in in april  eme completed financing and commenced construction of the doga project 
commercial operation is expected in april on august   eme entered into agreements to acquire the  mw homer city generating station  one of the largest coal fired generating plants in the mid atlantic region of the united states  for approximately billion 
homer city is jointly owned by subsidiaries of gpu  inc and new york state electric gas corporation 
the coal fired facility has the rights to direct  high voltage interconnections to both the new york power pool and the pennsylvania new jersey maryland power pool 
the plant is located approximately miles northeast of pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
eme will operate the plant  which is one of the lowest cost generation facilities in the region 
the closing of the homer city transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of most of the necessary state and federal regulatory approvals have been obtained 
eme plans to finance the acquisition with a combination of debt secured by the project  eme s corporate debt  and cash 
on december   eme had total consolidated assets of over billion  consolidated operating revenue of million  and consolidated net income of million 
in december  eme del caribe  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of eme  acquired of the mw ecoelectrica liquefied natural gas lng cogeneration facility under construction in penuelas  puerto rico for approximately million 
the project also includes a desalination plant and lng storage and vaporization facilities and is expected to begin commercial operation by late currently  most of eme s domestic operating power production facilities have qf status under the public utility regulatory policies act purpa and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
qf status exempts the projects from the application of the holding company act  many provisions of the federal power act  and state laws and regulations respecting rates and financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities 
eme  through wholly owned subsidiaries  also has ownership interests in five operating power projects that have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined in the holding company act 
in addition  some eme subsidiaries have made fuel related investments and a limited number of non energy related investments 
while qf status entitles projects to the benefits of purpa  each project must still comply with other federal  state  and local laws  including those regarding siting  construction  operation  licensing  and pollution abatement 
eme competes with many other companies  including multinational development groups  equipment suppliers  and other independent power producers including affiliates of utilities  in selling electric power and steam  and with electric utilities in obtaining the right to install new generating capacity 
over the past decade  obtaining a power sales contract with a utility has generally become a progressively more difficult  expensive  and competitive process 
many power sales contracts are now awarded by competitive bidding  which both increases the costs of obtaining such contracts and decreases the chances of obtaining such contracts 
as a result of competition  it may be difficult to obtain a power sales agreement for a proposed project  and the prices offered in new power sales agreements for both electric capacity and energy may be less than the prices in prior agreements 
eme evaluates each potential project in an effort to determine when the probability of success is high enough to justify expenditures in developing a proposal or bid for the project 
amendments to the holding company act made by the energy policy act have increased the number of competitors in the domestic independent power industry by reducing certain restrictions applicable to projects that are not qfs under purpa 
the offering of unbundled retail distribution service in certain states  through legislation or regulatory order  could also lead to increased competition in the independent power market 
year issue eme  like sce and the other nonutility companies  has a comprehensive program in place  provided overall coordination by edison international  to address potential year impacts 
see business of sce year issue above for a description of this program 
eme has essentially completed all phases of the project inventory  impact assessment  remediation  testing  and implementation and is going through the final review and approval process

palo verde and four corners are operated by other utilities 
sce operates and owns a undivided interest mw in the mohave generating station  which consists of two coal fueled steam electric generating units in clark county  nevada 
at year end  the existing sce owned generating capacity summer effective rating was divided approximately as follows nuclear  coal  hydroelectric  and oil 
san onofre  four corners  certain of sce s substations and portions of its transmission  distribution and communication systems are located on lands of the us or others under with minor exceptions licenses  permits  easements or leases  or on public streets or highways pursuant to franchises 
certain of such documents obligate sce  under specified circumstances and at its expense  to relocate transmission  distribution  and communication facilities located on lands owned or controlled by federal  state  or local governments 
the hydroelectric plants  some with related reservoirs  currently having an effective operating capacity of  mw  and are  with five exceptions  located in whole or in part on lands of the us pursuant to to year governmental licenses that expire at various times between and such licenses impose numerous restrictions and obligations on sce  including the right of the united states to acquire projects upon payment of specified compensation 
when existing licenses expire  ferc has the authority to issue new licenses to third parties  but only if their license application is superior to sce s and then only upon payment of specified compensation to sce 
any new licenses issued to sce are expected to be issued under terms and conditions less favorable than those of the expired licenses 
sce s applications for the relicensing of certain hydroelectric projects with an aggregate effective operating capacity of mw are pending 
the sce hydroelectric projects that are undergoing relicensing and whose long term licenses have expired  have been issued annual licenses  which will be renewed until the new licenses are issued 
in  sce s peak demand was  mw  set on august  substantially all of sce s properties are subject to the lien of a trust indenture securing first and refunding mortgage bonds trust indenture  of which approximately billion in principal amount was outstanding on december  such lien and sce s title to its properties are subject to the terms of franchises  licenses  easements  leases  permits  contracts  and other instruments under which properties are held or operated  certain statutes and governmental regulations  liens for taxes and assessments  and liens of the trustees under the trust indenture

sce construction program and capital expenditures cash required by sce for its capital expenditures totaled million in  and million in and million in construction expenditures for the period are forecasted at billion 
in addition to cash required for construction expenditures for the next five years as discussed above  billion is needed to meet requirements for long term debt maturities and sinking fund redemption requirements 
sce s estimates of cash available for operations for the five years through assume  among other things  the receipt of adequate and timely rate relief and the realization of its assumptions regarding cost increases  including the cost of capital 
sce s estimates and underlying assumptions are subject to continuous review and periodic revision 
the timing  type  and amount of all additional long term financing are also influenced by market conditions  rate relief  and other factors  including limitations imposed by sce s articles of incorporation and trust indenture 
nuclear power matters sce s nuclear facilities have been reliable sources of inexpensive  non polluting power for sce s customers for more than a decade 
throughout the operating life of these facilities  sce s customers have supported the revenue requirements of sce s capital investment in these facilities and for their incremental costs through traditional cost of service ratemaking 
in  the cpuc adopted sce s san onofre unit and proposal under which sce would have recovered its remaining investment in these san onofre units at a reduced rate of return of  but on an accelerated basis during the eight year period from the effective date in through december  ab  however  requires the recovery of the san onofre investment to be completed by december  in addition  the traditional cost of service ratemaking for san onofre units and was superseded by an incentive pricing plan in which sce s customers pay a preset price for each kwh of energy generated at san onofre during the eight year period 
ab allows for the continuation of the incentive pricing plan through december  sce was compensated for the incremental costs required for the continued operation of san onofre units and with revenue earned through the incentive pricing plan 
sce also retained the ability to request recovery of the cost of fuel consumed for generation of replacement energy for periods in which san onofre will not generate power through ecac filings and  beginning in  as part of atcp 
ab also allows sce to continue to collect funds for decommissioning expenses through traditional ratemaking treatment 
on july   the cpuc approved sce s request to transfer the recorded net investment in san onofre units and step up transformers to san onofre units and sunk costs for recovery by december   at a reduced rate of return of 
on august   the cpuc approved san diego gas electric s sdg e and sce s joint petition to modify  requesting continued recovery of certain corporate administrative and general costs allocable to san onofre units and  at rates of cent and cent per kwh  respectively  for the period january   through december  in  sce filed its palo verde proposal application requesting adoption of a new rate mechanism for palo verde consistent with that of san onofre units and on november   sce  ora  and turn entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the cpuc on december   regarding sce s palo verde proposal application which now allows sce to recover its remaining investment in the palo verde units by december   at a reduced rate of return of consistent with ab the settling parties agreed that sce would recover its share of palo verde incremental operating costs  except if those costs exceed of the levels forecast by sce in its application by more than in any given year in which case  sce must demonstrate that the aggregate amount of the costs exceeding the forecast in that year are reasonable 
if the annual palo verde site gross capacity factor gcf is less than in a calendar year  sce will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate that the site s operations causing the gcf to fall below were reasonable in that year 
if operations are determined to be unreasonable by the cpuc  sce s replacement power purchases associated with that period of palo verde operations below gcf may be disallowed 
beginning in  the benefits of future operation of palo verde units   and will be shared equally between shareholders and customers 
likewise  beginning in  the benefits of future operation of san onofre units and will be shared equally between shareholders and customers 
san onofre nuclear generating station in  the cpuc approved a settlement agreement between sce and ora to discontinue operation of unit at the end of its then current fuel cycle 
in november  sce discontinued operation of unit as part of the agreement  sce recovered its remaining investment over a four year period ending august on december   sce filed an application with the cpuc requesting authorization to access its nuclear decommissioning trust funds for unit for the purpose of commencing decommissioning of unit in the units and steam generators have performed relatively well through the first years of operation  with low rates of ongoing steam generator tube degradation 
during the unit scheduled refueling and inspection outage  which was completed in  an increased rate of degradation was identified  which resulted in the removal of more tubes from service than had been expected 
the present design analysis  which is being reviewed for a potential increase  allows for the removal of up to of the steam generator tubes before the unit s capacity must be re evaluated 
as a result of the increased degradation  a mid cycle outage was conducted in early for unit continued degradation was found during this inspection 
a favorable decreasing trend in degradation was observed during inspection in the scheduled refueling outage in january the results of the january inspection are being analyzed to determine if there is a need for a mid cycle inspection outage in early with the results from the january outage  of the tubes have now been removed from service 
in september  san onofre unit experienced a small amount of leakage from a steam generator tube plug  which required an day outage to repair 
during unit s refueling outage  which was completed in july  inspections of structural supports for steam generator tubes identified several areas where the thickness of the supports had been reduced  apparently by erosion during normal plant operation 
a follow up mid cycle inspection indicated that the erosion had been stabilized 
additional monitoring inspections are planned during the next scheduled refueling outage in to date  of unit s tubes have been removed from service 
during unit s february mid cycle outage  similar tube supports showed no significant levels of such erosion 
palo verde nuclear generating station based on latest available data  aps estimates that the unit and unit steam generators should operate for the year licensed operating life of those units  although aps continues to monitor the situation 
aps has disclosed that it believes that it will be economically desirable to replace the unit steam generators  which have been most affected by tube cracking  in four to nine years 
aps has indicated to the participants that it believes that replacement of the unit steam generators would cost between million and million 
sce estimates that this cost could be higher  such that its share of this cost would be between million and million plus replacement power costs 
unanimous approval of the palo verde participants is required for capital improvements  including steam generator replacement 
in december  the palo verde participants unanimously agreed to purchase two spare steam generators at a cost of approximately million  however  sce has not yet decided whether it supports replacement of the unit steam generators 
during  palo verde nuclear generating station generated billion kwh of electricity 
it was the first time an american power plant of any kind crossed the billion kwh threshold in a single year 
palo verde broke its own record of billion kwh that it set in and was the nation s top power producer for the fourth consecutive year 
the year end station capacity factor was 
units and were each refueled in day outages a site record 
unit operated on line the entire year and at year s end had operated continuously for days 
nuclear facility decommissioning with the exception of san onofre unit  sce plans to decommission its nuclear generating facilities at the end of each facility s operating license by a prompt removal method authorized by the nrc 
on december   sce filed an application with the cpuc requesting the authority to access its decommissioning trust funds for san onofre unit for the purpose of decommissioning commencing in decommissioning is estimated to cost billion in current year dollars based on site specific studies performed in for san onofre and palo verde 
this estimate considers the total cost of decommissioning and dismantling the plant  including labor  material  burial  and other costs 
the site specific studies are updated approximately every three years 
changes in the estimated costs  timing of decommissioning  or the assumptions underlying these estimates could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission in the near term 
decommissioning is scheduled to begin in at san onofre unit sce expects decommissioning san onofre units and and palo verde to occur after its generating licenses expire in and respectively 
decommissioning expense was million in and million in the accumulated provision for decommissioning was billion at december   and billion at december  the estimated costs to decommission san onofre unit million in dollars are recorded as a liability 
decommissioning funds collected in rates are placed in independent trusts which  together with accumulated earnings  will be utilized solely for decommissioning 
nuclear insurance federal law limits public liability claims from a nuclear incident to billion 
sce and other owners of san onofre and palo verde have purchased the maximum private primary insurance available million 
the balance is covered by the industry s retrospective rating plan that uses deferred premium charges to every reactor licensee if a nuclear incident at any licensed reactor in the us results in claims and or costs which exceed the primary insurance at that plant site 
federal regulations require this secondary level of financial protection 
the nrc exempted san onofre unit from this secondary level  effective june the maximum deferred premium for each nuclear incident is million per reactor  but not more than million per reactor may be charged in any one year for each incident 
based on its ownership interests  sce could be required to pay a maximum of million per nuclear incident 
sce  however  would have to pay no more than million per incident in any one year 
such premium amounts include a surcharge if additional funds are needed to satisfy public liability claims and are subject to periodic adjustment for inflation 
if the public liability limit above is insufficient  federal regulations may impose further revenue raising measures to pay claims  including a possible additional assessment on all licensed reactor operators 
property damage insurance covers losses up to million  including decontamination costs  at san onofre and palo verde 
decontamination liability and property damage coverage exceeding the primary million has also been purchased in amounts greater than federal requirements 
additional insurance covers part of replacement power expenses during an accident related nuclear unit outage 
these policies are issued primarily by mutual insurance companies owned by utilities with nuclear facilities 
if losses at any nuclear facility covered by these arrangements were to exceed the accumulated funds for these insurance programs  sce could be assessed retrospective premium adjustments of up to million per year 
insurance premiums are charged to operating expense 
item legal proceedings edison international tradename litigation on september   an action was filed against edison international in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging trademark infringement under the lanham act and related state causes of action for unfair competition

on the same day  the court stayed all proceedings in the california action pending an order by the new york appellate court of the appeal by pmnc of a denial of its motion to dismiss the new york action 
that appeal was denied following a hearing on september  southern california edison company wind generators litigation sce was named as a defendant in a series of eight lawsuits brought by independent power producers of wind generation 
seven of the lawsuits were filed in los angeles county superior court and one was filed in kern county superior court 
the lawsuits alleged that sce incorrectly interpreted contracts with the plaintiffs by limiting fixed energy payments to a single ten year period rather than beginning a new ten year period of fixed energy payments for each stage of development 
in its responses to the complaints  sce denied the plaintiffs allegations 
in each of the lawsuits  the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief regarding the proper interpretation of the contracts 
plaintiffs alleged a combined total of approximately million in damages  which included consequential damages claimed in seven of the eight lawsuits 
a ninth lawsuit was subsequently filed in los angeles county raising claims similar to those alleged in the first eight 
sce responded to the complaint in the new lawsuit by denying its material allegations 
after receiving a favorable decision in the liability phase of the lead case  sce agreed to settle with the plaintiffs in seven of the lawsuits on terms whereby sce waived its rights to recover costs against such plaintiffs in exchange for their agreement that there is only one fixed price period under each of their power purchase contracts with sce and a mutual dismissal with prejudice of claims 
sce also entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff in another of the lawsuits which resolved the issue of multiple fixed price periods on the same terms and which also resolved a related issue unique to that plaintiff in exchange for a nominal payment by sce
