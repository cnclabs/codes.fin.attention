unsecured credit facility in october  the company obtained a million unsecured credit facility from a group of commercial banks for the purpose of financing the rockwell acquisition 
at december   the interest rate on the note was per annum 
in january  this facility was repaid with proceeds of the additional note offering 
pulse note as partial payment for the pulse acquisition  the company issued a million note due january  interest is payable semiannually and accrues at until february   and from february  until january   interest will accrue at the prime rate charged by chase manhattan bank on december  plus with a maximum adjustment of 
comet notes in connection with the comet acquisition  the company issued notes totaling million  of which unsecured notes totaling million were delivered by the company and a note in the amount of million was delivered by a subsidiary of the company and secured by the acquired assets 
the notes bore interest at the rate of per annum and were scheduled to mature on october  these notes were repaid in january see subsequent event below 
esop in connection with the establishment of the esop in january  the company made a million loan to the esop the esop loan  which was used to purchase  shares of the company s outstanding common stock 
the esop loan had an original term of years  with annual payments of principal and interest of approximately million 
the esop loan bears interest at per annum 
the esop will repay the esop loan using contributions from the company 
the company is obligated to contribute amounts sufficient to repay the esop loan 
the net effect of the esop is that the company s common stock is allocated to employees in lieu of a retirement plan that was previously a cash based defined benefit plan and  accordingly  results in reduced annual cash outlays by an estimated to million 
subsequent event in january  the company issued the additional notes at a premium resulting in an effective rate of 
as a result of the issuance and payoff of the unsecured credit facility  the company will write off previously capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately 
per diluted share in the first quarter of management believes  based upon current levels of operations and forecasted earnings  that cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under the credit agreement  will be adequate to make payments of principal and interest on debt  including the notes  to make required contributions to the esop  to permit anticipated capital expenditures  and to fund working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future  including the issuance of the additional notes increased the company s liquidity by reducing its outstanding revolving credit borrowings and thereby increasing its available borrowing capacity 
nevertheless  the company will remain leveraged to a significant extent and its debt service obligations will continue to be substantial 
the debt of the company requires the dedication of a substantial portion of future cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for capital expenditures and future business opportunities that the company believes are available 
cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to meet its debt service requirements 
if the company s sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company s cash requirements  the company may need to refinance its existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available  and  in any case  such new financing  if available  would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 
the company intends in to reduce its indebtedness through generating operating income and by reducing working capital requirements and other measures 
effects of year the company has information system improvement initiatives in process that include both new computer hardware and software applications 
the new system is substantially operational and is year compliant 
the estimated cost of the project is expected to be in the to million range with the majority of costs approximately million previously incurred 
the majority of the expenditures incurred for hardware and purchased software related to this project have been capitalized and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
other costs  such as training and advisory consulting  are expensed as incurred 
these expenditures are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s future results of operations or financial condition 
the company has identified other equipment it uses in its operations that have non information system characteristics and have embedded technology components  such as those items with internal clocks 
the company will need to replace this type of equipment but does not believe a possible year failure will have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the estimated cost of replacement equipment is not considered significant 
the company has received written assurances from some of its suppliers and customers and other providers acknowledging year issues and stating their present intention to be compliant  however  not all customers  vendors and providers have provided such assurances 
the company will evaluate on an ongoing basis whether it is necessary and practical to establish contingency plans with respect to year issues 
however  if large scale systems failures occur  it could have a significant adverse effect on the company s financial condition  future results of operations and liquidity 
the company s products are generally sold with a limited warranty for defects 
the company has reviewed its products currently in use by its customers or being sold and does not believe that there will be material increases in warranty or liability claims arising out of year non compliance 
however  a material increase in such claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  future results of operations and liquidity 
effects of inflation  seasonality general price inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
some of the company s labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses  which would cause the company s cost automatically to increase if inflation were to become significant 
the company s business is not seasonal  although the third quarter results generally tend to be slightly lower than other quarters  reflecting vacation and down time at its major customers during this period 
conversion to the euro currency on january   certain members of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european union s common currency the euro 
the company conducts business in member countries
