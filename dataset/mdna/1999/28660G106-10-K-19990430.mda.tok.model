for example  in fiscal  of the company s net sales were made during the second half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from its customers  sales and results of operations can vary significantly between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result  the company expects to experience variability in net sales and net income on a quarterly basis 
the company s working capital borrowings are also seasonal  and are normally highest in the months of september  october and november 
during the fourth fiscal quarter ending january  significant cash is normally generated as customer payments on holiday season orders are received

in connection with the psi acquisition  the company paid approximately million in cash and issued a subordinated debenture of  the psi debenture 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed from available cash from operations 
the psi debenture is non interest bearing  with the principal amount being payable within months of the date of closing of the psi acquisition  and is being held by the company as security for psi s indemnification obligations under the asset purchase agreement between the company and psi 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company financed approximately million of the purchase price not including approximately million of accounts payable assumed for the jpf acquisition with available cash from operations  the company s credit facility and a million debenture the jpf debenture 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility for the jpf acquisition were repaid from the proceeds of the april note offering 
the jpf debenture is non interest bearing  with the principal amount being payable in three equal annual installments only if certain conditions relating to jpf s business are achieved by the company  including achieving certain gross profit thresholds 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company has historically financed  and expects to continue to finance  its internal growth and acquisitions primarily through internally generated funds  its credit facility and external financing 
the company s principal future uses of funds are for working capital requirements  debt service and additional brand acquisitions or product distribution arrangements 
as a result of several acquisitions during the past four years  including the geoffrey beene acquisition  the halston acquisition  the fmg acquisition  the jpf acquisition and the psi acquisition  the growth in direct distribution relationships for additional fragrance brands and certain favorable product buying opportunities  the company s working capital needs have increased significantly 
nevertheless  management of the company believes that internally generated funds and available financing under the credit facility will be sufficient to cover the company s working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months  other than any additional working capital requirements which may result from further expansion of the company s operations through acquisitions of brands or new product distribution arrangements 
the company s future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon its relative amounts of current assets principally cash  accounts receivable and inventories and current liabilities principally short term debt  accrued expenses and accounts payable 
additional inventory requirements and accounts receivable can have a significant impact on the company s liquidity  particularly during expansion 
to date  the company generally has not experienced any material adverse problems with the collection of accounts receivable relating to its fragrance operations 
there can be no assurance that refusals to pay or delays in payment would not have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  results of operations and general financial condition in the future 
the company establishes reserves and provides allowances for returns at the time of sale  but there can be no assurance that such reserves and allowances will be adequate 
in connection with the increased department store business associated with the psi acquisition  the company expects to see an increase in reserves as a percentage of gross sales and expects to increase its reserves and allowances as necessary 
further expansion of the company s operations  including through additional brand acquisitions or the acquisition of exclusive distribution rights to additional fragrance brands  will require increased investment in accounts receivable and inventories  which may negatively impact the company s cash flow from operations 
the company has discussions from time to time with manufacturers of prestige fragrance brands and with distributors that hold exclusive distribution rights regarding possible acquisitions by the company of additional exclusive manufacturing and or distribution rights 
the company currently has no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although it periodically executes routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with manufacturers and distributors 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that it will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of its operations 
in april  the company consummated the private placement under rule a pursuant to the securities act of  as amended the act  of million principal amount of series c senior notes due the series c senior notes were sold at of their principal amount and had substantially similar terms to the million principal amount of the company s series b senior notes which were issued in may the net proceeds of the april note offering from the sales of the series c senior notes of approximately million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  which were used for the jpf acquisition  as well as for working capital purposes 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in august  the series c senior notes were exchanged for an equivalent principal amount of series d senior notes containing identical terms to the series c senior notes  but which have been registered under the act 
the indentures pursuant to which the series b senior notes and the series d senior notes were issued the indentures generally permit the company subject to the satisfaction of a fixed charge covenant ratio and  in certain cases  also a net income test to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  purchase or redeem capital stock of the company  or redeem subordinated indebtedness 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the indentures do not limit the amounts which can be borrowed by the company under any credit facility 
the company presently has a credit facility with fleet which provides for borrowings on a revolving basis of up to million including up to million in commercial letters of credit for general corporate purposes  including working capital needs and acquisitions  subject to certain borrowing base limitations 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility currently mature on may  the company expects to renew the credit facility with fleet for three years effective june loans under the revolving credit portion of the credit facility bear interest  payable monthly  at a floating rate ranging from  at the option of the company  either i over the london interbank offered rate libor to over libor or ii the prime rate as quoted by fleet to over such prime rate  and combinations thereof  in each case depending on the ratio of the company s total funded debt to its shareholders equity base 
the company s borrowing availability under the credit facility is limited to the sum of between to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory up to a maximum of million 
these limitations do not  however  currently affect the company s ability to utilize the full amount of the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on all of the company s accounts receivable and inventory 
the company s existing collateral base is more than adequate to cover the collateral requirements of the credit facility and management believes  based on discussions with its lender  that  if necessary  the excess collateral could be used to increase the borrowing availability under the credit facility to fund acquisitions or for additional working capital requirements 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the credit facility restricts the company s ability to incur additional non trade debt with certain exceptions  including indebtedness not exceeding million for a fiscal year issued in connection with certain asset purchases  and to enter into certain acquisitions  mergers  investments and affiliated transactions  and prohibits the payment of dividends on  or the redemption of  the company s capital stock  certain payments on its subordinated debt  and the sale of the company s interest in its subsidiaries 
at january   the company had approximately million of availability under the credit facility to use for additional working capital support and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
at april   the company had no amounts borrowed under the credit facility and  thus  had million of availability 
the company pays quarterly in arrears a fee of per annum on the unused portion of the credit facility and a letter of credit fee of per annum on the face amount of trade letters of credit and per annum on the face amount of stand by letters of credit issued and outstanding 
at january   the company had outstanding approximately million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures due the convertible debentures 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the convertible debentures are convertible at any time at per share into shares of common stock  and are redeemable at par at any time commencing july  at the option of the company  but only in the event the common stock  at the time a redemption notice is delivered by the company  has been trading at not less than for consecutive trading days 
the convertible debentures are due june  and require interest only payments payable semi annually until maturity  at which time the entire unpaid principal amount and any unpaid accrued interest is due and payable 
the company also has outstanding approximately million aggregate principal amount of subordinated debentures the debentures 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the debentures require mandatory annual principal repayments in the aggregate amount of million on may  and the characteristics of the company s business do not generally require it to make significant ongoing capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended january   the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures excluding fixed assets acquired in connection with the psi acquisition  primarily relating to computer software and hardware costs  the purchase of warehouse and manufacturing equipment and the expansion of the warehouse racking area 
during fiscal  the company is planning to add new features to its distribution management system during the summer of and to make other capital expenditures to improve its production and delivery capabilities 
the company anticipates that its capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended january  will be approximately million 
year the company has evaluated both its information technology it systems and technologies which include embedded non it systems for year compliance 
the company believes that its it and non it systems are year compliant 
the primary it systems of the company are a fully integrated accounting  forecasting  purchasing and order entry software system  an edi system  which allows customers of the company to order products electronically from the company and to be invoiced electronically for those orders  and a distribution management system  which assists the company in facilitating and managing the shipment of products to its customers 
the software companies that developed those systems all have represented to the company that their systems are year compliant 
in fact  all three systems are relatively new  having been installed at the company over the last eighteen months 
the company anticipates adding new features to its existing distribution management system during the summer of  which will allow the company to better manage the receipt and control of its inventory 
the software developer of the distribution management system has represented that the new features of the system will be year compliant 
other it systems include the company s personal computers  servers and associated software  all of which the company believes are year compliant 
the company s non it systems  which are generally embedded in its equipment and machinery  have been evaluated for year compliance 
the company believes that all of its non it systems are year compliant 
as part of the year project  the company has identified relationships with third parties  including customers  suppliers and service providers  which the company believes are material to its business and operations 
the company is in the process of contacting these third parties through questionnaires  letters or interviews in an effort to determine the status of their year readiness 
the company has already received responses from many of those third parties and will follow up with them until it is satisfied with the reported status of their year compliance efforts 
the company expects to complete its third party compliance review process by august additionally  the company has been testing and will continue to test edi transmissions to its customers to determine year compliance 
for the remainder of and into  the company will continue to assess and monitor the progress of its material third party customers  suppliers and service providers in resolving year issues 
because the year compliance features of the company s it systems were an integral part of its recently procured management information systems  no specific costs have been attributed by the company to the year compliance of its systems 
additionally  to date  the company has not determined that any of its non it systems need to be fixed or replaced due to year issues 
although  the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur labor and material costs associated with the assessment  testing and monitoring of the year compliance of its own systems and those of its material third party customers  suppliers and service providers  these costs are not anticipated to be material to the company s business  results of operations or financial position 
the company has not determined the actual year compliance costs it has incurred to date  because such costs have not been considered material 
the company anticipates minimal disruptions to its business and operations as a result of system failures related to year issues 
nevertheless  if the company or a key third party customer  supplier or service provider experiences a systems failure due to a year problem  the company s business  results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that the most significant impact would be an inability to process customer transactions  to collect its accounts receivable or to ensure timely delivery of inventory 
although the company does not believe that the actual impact of year issues will be material  the company is currently developing contingency plans to respond to potential year issues 
in particular  the company is developing contingency plans to receive product requirements and to receive and fulfill customer orders in the event that the delivery of products and the processing of customer transactions are affected by year issues 
the company will continue to develop and refine its contingency plans based on tests with third parties and its assessment of other internal and outside risks 
the company anticipates completing the vast majority of its contingency planning by august item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe that it is materially at risk relating to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price risks fluctuations 
the only debt instrument of the company that is subject to interest rate fluctuations is its million credit facility 
while inflation likely would increase the interest rates that the company pays on its credit facility  based on the amounts and projected utilization of the credit facility  the company does not anticipate that any such increase would be material to its results of operations 
further  all of the company s purchases of fragrances and related cosmetic products from foreign suppliers are in us dollars  which avoids foreign currency exchange rate risks 
moreover  while the company s international sales may be subject to foreign currency fluctuation risks  such sales  and any currency fluctuations relating to those sales  have not been and are not expected to be material to the company s results of operations
