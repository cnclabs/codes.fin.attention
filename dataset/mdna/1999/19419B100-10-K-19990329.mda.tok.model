year issues assessment the company believes its exposure to year problems lies primarily in two areas i its own internal operating systems  and ii year compliance by third parties with whom the company has a material relationship 
the company has completed an assessment of its principal internal systems 
however  the company is continuing to assess its year exposure with respect to third parties 
while the costs of these assessment efforts are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition or any year s results of operations  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
internal operating systems the company believes that its principal internal systems are year compliant 
the company recently installed upgraded versions of its internal accounting  management and financial reporting applications which the vendor has represented are year compliant 
some of the company s non critical applications  however  may not be year compliant 
the company is conducting a program to identify and resolve any such exposure 
although the costs related to these efforts are not expected to be material to the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  no assurance can be made that this will be the case 
third party relationships the company is conducting a program to identify and resolve year exposure from third parties 
the company is presently conducting inquiries of its outside vendors  suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and marketing partners to assess their year readiness 
any failure of third parties with whom the company has a material relationship to resolve year problems in a timely manner could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks of the company s year issues the company expects to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the company believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting it have been identified or will be corrected 
further  the company cannot accurately predict how many failures related to the year problem will occur or the severity  duration or financial consequences of such failures 
as a result  the company expects that it could possibly suffer the following consequences o a significant number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for the company and the company s customers that may divert the company s time and attention and financial and human resources from the company s ordinary business activities  and o a lesser number of serious system failures whether the company s systems or those of its vendors  suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and marketing partners that may require significant efforts by the company  its customers or third parties to prevent or alleviate material business disruptions 
costs other than time spent by the company s own personnel  to date the company has not incurred any significant costs in identifying and remediating year problems 
the company s contingency plans the company believes its plans for addressing the year problem are adequate 
the company does not believe it will incur a material financial impact from system failures  or from the costs associated with assessing and addressing the risks of failure  arising from the year problem 
consequently  the company does not intend to create a detailed contingency plan 
in the event that the company does not adequately identify and resolve its year issues  the absence of a detailed contingency plan may materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations
