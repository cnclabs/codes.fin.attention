year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year during fiscal and continuing through fiscal  the company is in the process of converting substantially all of its computer software systems and hardware 
prior to the purchase of the new systems and hardware the company obtained or is in the process of obtaining assurance from the vendors that the products purchased are in fact year compliant 
the company will also complete an independent review of such systems to further verify year compliance 
the company has performed a thorough review of its existing computer software systems and hardware to identify processes which may be affected by year problems 
at this time  no significant issues have been identified and the company has developed an adequate plan for year compliance should the conversions fall behind schedule 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company is also in the process of completing a year review of its relationships with suppliers and financial institutions to obtain assurance  where necessary  that these entities are year compliant 
the company s total year project costs include the estimated costs and time associated with the impact of a third party s year issue on the company  and are based on presently available information 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if the company is not completely successful in mitigating internal and external year risks  the result could be a system failure causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  distribute merchandise  or engage in similar normal business activities at the company or its vendors and suppliers 
the company believes that under a worst case scenario  it could continue the majority of its normal business activities on a manual basis 
with respect to potential year failures of its vendors and suppliers  the company plans to mitigate this risk by not depending on any single vendor or supplier for products or merchandise 
due to the fact that the majority of the company s computer software systems and hardware have been purchased or developed recently and were designed to be year compliant  the company does not expect to incur significant additional costs in addressing the year issue 
the total cost of the year project is estimated at  and will be funded through operating cash flows 
year costs as of january  totaled
