year issue the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its operations to identify those systems that could be affected by the year issue 
the review covered information systems  mainframe and personal computers  the company s product research and development facilities and its manufacturing operations 
the year issue is the general term used to describe various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery  as a result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or any hardware that has date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  production difficulties  or an inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
management presently believes that the company has substantially completed its year planning for its internal systems and facilities utilizing both internal and external resources 
the company has implemented a new computer network throughout the organization and is currently implementing a year compliant version of its core business software 
it is anticipated that year compliance efforts will be completed by mid  allowing time for testing

management also plans to review its external relationships to address potential year issues arising from relationships with significant suppliers  service providers and customers and will determine whether it is appropriate  in light of particular relationships and their size and sophistication  to contact significant customers 
contingency plans are being considered and to the extent practicable will be put in place  as required  during in the event that the company determines that it is at significant risk in regard to suppliers  customers or its own internal hardware and software 
contingency plans may include  but will not be limited to  consideration of alternative sources of supply  customer communication plans  manually performing certain functions and plant and business response plans 
in general  the company s plans are intended to provide a means of managing risk  but cannot eliminate the potential for disruption due to third party failure 
the company believes that due to the widespread nature of the potential year issues  its contingency planning is an ongoing process which will require further consideration as the company obtains additional information 
the company has not yet developed specific contingency plans in the event of a year failure caused by a supplier or third party  but intends to do so if a specific problem is identified through the program described above 
in some cases  particularly with respect to its utility vendors  alternative suppliers may not be available 
the failure to correct a material year problem could  of course  result in an interruption in  or failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of the company s suppliers  other third party providers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of any year failures will have a material impact on the company 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the company s year modifications  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be mitigated
