utility industry outlook iec competes in an ever changing utility industry 
set forth below is an overview of this evolving marketplace 
electric energy generation  transmission and distribution are in a period of fundamental change in the manner in which customers obtain  and energy suppliers provide  energy services 
as legislative  regulatory  economic and technological changes occur  electric utilities are facing increased numbers of alternative suppliers 
such competitive pressures could result in loss of customers and an incurrence of stranded costs ie  assets and other costs rendered unrecoverable as the result of competitive pricing 
to the extent stranded costs cannot be recovered from customers  they would be borne by security holders 
legislation which would allow customers to choose their electric energy supplier is expected to be introduced in iowa and minnesota in iec does not currently expect similar legislation to be introduced in wisconsin this year 
nationwide  states including illinois and michigan have decided to provide for customer choice 
iec realized   and of its electric utility revenues in  in iowa  wisconsin  minnesota and illinois  respectively 
approximately of the electric revenues were regulated by the respective state commissions while the other were regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
iec realized   and of its gas utility revenues in iowa  wisconsin  minnesota and illinois  respectively  during the same period 
iesu realized of its electric and gas utility retail revenues in in iowa 
approximately of the electric revenues in were regulated by the iowa utilities board iub while the other were regulated by the ferc 
wp l realized of its electric utility revenues in in wisconsin and in illinois 
approximately of the electric revenues in were regulated by the public service commission of wisconsin pscw or the illinois commerce commission icc while the other were regulated by the ferc 
wp l realized of its gas utility revenues in in wisconsin and in illinois 
federal regulation wp l  iesu and ipc are subject to regulation by the ferc 
the national energy policy act of addresses several matters designed to promote competition in the electric wholesale power generation market 
in  ferc issued final rules ferc orders and requiring electric utilities to open their transmission lines to other wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity 
in march  ferc issued orders on rehearing for orders and orders a and a 
in response to ferc orders and a  alliant energy corporate services  on behalf of wp l  iesu and ipc  filed an open access transmission tariff that complies with the orders 
upon receiving the final merger related regulatory order  a compliance tariff was filed by alliant energy corporate services with the ferc 
this filing was made to comply with the ferc s merger order 
in response to ferc orders and a  wp l  iesu and ipc are participating in a regional open access same time information system 
ferc order permits utilities to seek recovery of legitimate  prudent and verifiable stranded costs associated with providing open access transmission services 
ferc does not have jurisdiction over retail distribution and  consequently  the final ferc rules do not provide for the recovery of stranded costs resulting from retail competition 
the various states retain jurisdiction over the question of whether to permit retail competition  the terms of such retail competition  and the recovery of any portion of stranded costs that are ultimately determined to have resulted from retail competition 
iec and the utility subsidiaries cannot predict the long term consequences of these rules on their results of operations or financial condition 
in november  iec and northern states power co 
nsp announced plans to develop an independent transmission company itc to provide electric transmission services to the upper midwest 
the two companies are developing a relationship by which nsp will create an independent transmission entity that  in turn  will lease the transmission assets of iec 
the independent entity is expected to be publicly traded and have its own board of directors  management and employees 
in february  the nebraska public power district signed an agreement with iec and nsp to share information and discuss how they might participate in the proposed itc 
iec expects to file with the pscw  ferc and minnesota public utilities commission mpuc in the second quarter of for permission to lease its transmission assets to the itc 
filings will also be made at the iub and icc at a later time 
the first ferc filing will also include a tariff designed to allow for open and economical delivery of electric power throughout the region 
the tariff will be available to non itc participants as well as itc members 
although no assurance can be given  iec and nsp currently believe they can have the itc established in the year iec had originally filed to participate in the midwest independent system operator midwest iso which was conditionally approved by the ferc on september  however  as a result of the itc announcement  iec has withdrawn its midwest iso membership 
state regulation iowa iesu and ipc are subject to regulation by the iub 
the iub has issued an order covering unbundling of natural gas rates for all iowa customers 
in the first quarter of  the iub conducted workshops concerning this unbundling as well as allowing choice of the supplier of the natural gas for the small volume natural gas customers 
inasmuch as gas is a flow through cost item in iowa  and iec would retain the margins on the delivery of the natural gas  the impact on iec of these potential changes is not expected to be material 
the iub has been reviewing all forms of competition in the electric utility industry for several years 
a group comprised of the iub  iec  midamerican energy company maec  the rural electric cooperatives  the municipal utilities and iowans for choice in electricity a diverse group of industrial customers  marketers  such as enron  and a low income customer representative  among others has endorsed a bill that was agreed upon in february iec expects the bill to be introduced in the iowa legislature in march the bill is opposed by the office of consumer advocate  which is charged by iowa law with representation of all consumers generally 
the bill would allow choice of electric suppliers for all customers on may  it would freeze iesu s and ipc s iowa regulated prices at january levels 
the iub could not order any rate reductions subsequent to the bill s proposed effective date of june  it would allow  however  for investor owned utilities to propose increases due to exogenous factors for example  environmental compliance costs in the generation cost component 
assigned service territories would be maintained for the delivery function 
delivery prices would be regulated  with the option available to propose performance based rate making 
prices for generation and other retail services would not be regulated  except for standard offer service sos pricing starting may for all residential customers and non residential customers with annual usage of less than  kilowatt hours kwh 
pricing for sos would initially be at levels equivalent to prices as they exist today 
sos would continue until at least december  the iub would be able to terminate sos if it were to determine several conditions exist  including  most importantly  that effective competition exists such that regulation is no longer necessary 
if the iub continues sos past december   then prices would be based upon competitive bids 
there are no price protections for non residential customers with usage greater than  kwh annually  with the exception of transitional service 
transitional service would exist for no longer than one year  until may   at prices the iub determines to be just and reasonable 
currently existing automatic fuel adjustment clauses for recovery of fuel costs would be eliminated no later than may a nuclear only fuel adjustment would be permitted with increased prices effective immediately if an electric company s nuclear plant is not operational due to exogenous factors 
transition cost is the difference between the revenues that would have been collected pursuant to an electric company s revenue requirement existing as of january   and market prices for the period through these differences would be afforded recovery in  in  in and in effective january   transition cost recovery would end 
in lieu of accepting this transition cost recovery mechanism  an electric utility may elect to divest itself of its generation assets  including power supply contracts 
in such case  the utility would be given an opportunity to be made whole for recovery of embedded costs with the possibility for shareowners to retain the amount realized from the sale of the assets beyond the sum of depreciated book value and unfunded decommissioning 
a divestiture plan would be filed with the iub no later than january   with iub approval or modification by july  the utility would have until september   to revoke its election 
costs of start up  including computer systems and employee transition costs  would be recoverable over a ten year period  as approved by the iub 
the difference between regulatory assets and liabilities would be fully recoverable as a delivery charge 
nuclear decommissioning costs would be fully recoverable 
iec is unable to predict if this legislation will be enacted in or what modifications  if any  may be made to the proposed bill 
wisconsin wp l is subject to regulation by the pscw 
the pscw s inquiries into the future structure of the natural gas and electric utility industries are ongoing 
the stated goal of the pscw in the natural gas docket is to accommodate competition but not create it 
the pscw has followed a measured approach to restructuring the natural gas industry in wisconsin 
the pscw has determined that customer classes will be deregulated ie  the gas utility would no longer have an obligation to procure gas commodity for customers  but would still have a delivery obligation in a step wise manner  after each class has been demonstrated to have a sufficient number of gas suppliers available 
a number of working groups have been established by the pscw and these working groups are addressing numerous issues which need to be resolved before deregulation may proceed 
the short term goals of the electric restructuring process are to ensure reliability of the state s electric system and development of a robust wholesale electric market 
the longer term goal is to establish prerequisite safeguards to protect customers prior to allowing retail customer choice 
the pscw has issued an order outlining its policies and principles for public benefits low income assistance  energy efficiency  renewable generation and environmental research and development including funding levels  administration of the funds and how funds should be collected from customers 
the pscw has proposed increasing annual funding levels primarily through utility rates by to million statewide 
in may  the pscw reactivated docket no 
bu  with the objective of examining the degree of separation which should be required as a matter of policy between utility and non utility activities involving the various state utilities 
hearings were held in the fourth quarter of but a final decision by the pscw has not been issued yet 
a future phase of the docket will investigate the standards of conduct that should govern relationships and transactions between a utility and its affiliates 
it is anticipated that there will be legislative proposals introduced in the legislative session on issues dealing with restructuring  including affiliated interest  public benefits  competition and others 
it is impossible to predict at this time the scope or the possibility of enactment of such proposals 
minnesota ipc is subject to regulation by the mpuc 
the mpuc established an electric competition working group in april on october   the working group issued a report and recommendations on retail competition 
the mpuc reviewed the report and directed its staff to develop an electric utility restructuring plan and timeline 
it does not appear that any restructuring legislation will be passed in illinois ipc and wp l are subject to regulation by the icc 
in december  the state of illinois passed electric deregulation legislation requiring customer choice of electric suppliers for non residential customers with loads of four megawatts or larger and for approximately one third of all other non residential customers starting october  all remaining non residential customers will be eligible for customer choice beginning december  and all residential customers will be eligible for customer choice beginning may  the new legislation is not expected to have a significant impact on iec s results of operations or financial condition given the relatively small size of iec s illinois operations 
accounting implications each of the utilities complies with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas provides that rate regulated public utilities record certain costs and credits allowed in the rate making process in different periods than for nonregulated entities 
these are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and are recognized in the consolidated statements of income at the time they are reflected in rates 
if a portion of the utility subsidiaries operations becomes no longer subject to the provisions of sfas as a result of competitive restructurings or otherwise  a write down of related regulatory assets and possibly other charges would be required  unless some form of transition cost recovery is established by the appropriate regulatory body that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets during such recovery period 
in addition  each utility subsidiary would be required to determine any impairment of other assets and write down any impaired assets to their fair value 
the utility subsidiaries believe they currently meet the requirements of sfas positioning for a competitive environment iec and its subsidiaries cannot currently predict the long term consequences of the competitive and restructuring issues described above on their results of operations or financial condition 
the major objective is to allow the company to compete successfully in a competitive  deregulated utility industry 
the strategy for dealing with these emerging issues includes seeking growth opportunities  forming strategic alliances with other energy related businesses  continuing to offer quality customer service  initiating ongoing cost reductions and productivity enhancements and developing new products and services 
as competitive forces shape the energy services industry  energy providers will face challenges to continued growth 
since consumption of electricity or natural gas is expected to grow only modestly within iec s utility service territory  iec has entered several markets that provide opportunities for new sources of earnings growth 
in addition to alliant energy resources existing businesses  iec has launched four distinct platforms designed to meet customer needs throughout the midwest  the nation and the world 
these platforms include alliant energy industrial services  a provider of energy and environmental services designed to maximize productivity for industrial and large commercial customers  alliant energy international  a partner in developing energy generation and infrastructure in growing markets throughout the world  alliant energy retail services  encompassing a wide array of products and services designed to meet the comfort  security and productivity needs of residential and small commercial customers  and cargill alliant energy  an energy trading joint venture that combines the superior risk management and commodity trading expertise of cargill incorporated cargill  one of the world s largest and most established commodity trading firms  with iec s low cost electric generation and transmission business experience 
iec believes that each of these four platforms provides unique prospects for growth both individually and collectively as the competitive energy services marketplace evolves 
iec results of operations overview iec s net income for each of the last three years was as follows earnings excluding merger related charges net income in thousands    earnings per share pre tax merger related charges in thousands    earnings as reported net income in thousands    earnings per share the above financial information reflects the consummation of the merger on april   as a pooling of interests 
the merger related charges were primarily for employee retirements and separations  the services of iec s advisors  costs related to iec s name change and other miscellaneous costs 
iec s utility operations reported net income of million in  million for and million in excluding merger related expenses  the utility earnings were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in utility earnings excluding merger related expenses in resulted primarily from higher purchased power and transmission costs at wp l  a percent decrease in retail natural gas sales largely due to milder weather conditions in compared to  a million regulatory asset write off at iesu  increased expenses for year readiness efforts  higher injuries and damages expenses and increased depreciation expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by a percent increase in retail electricity sales volumes  largely due to continued economic growth within iec s service territory  lower purchased power capacity costs at iesu and ipc  reduced employee pension and benefits costs  and lower costs in due to merger related operating efficiencies 
a loss incurred on the disposition of an investment in at iesu also enhanced the earnings compared to iec s nonregulated operations alliant energy resources reported net losses of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
excluding merger related expenses  the nonregulated operations net losses were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in earnings excluding merger related expenses was due to lower oil and gas prices at whiting petroleum corp 
whiting  iec s denver based oil and gas subsidiary  continuing expenses for new business development in international and domestic markets  higher interest expense to fund iec s growth and the pursuit of other business opportunities  and a modest loss from iec s electricity trading joint venture 
a tax benefit realized in from a donation of securities to iec s charitable foundation also contributed to the lower earnings in compared to increased earnings from iec s industrial services businesses as well as gains realized on asset sales partially offset these items 
the decrease in utility earnings was primarily due to increased operating expenses  higher interest expense  rate decreases implemented at wp l and ipc in  the loss on the investment disposition at iesu in and the recognition of a gain on the sale of a combustion turbine in at wp l 
partially offsetting this decrease were increased retail electric sales and costs incurred in relating to the successful defense of a hostile takeover attempt of ies by maec 
the decrease in nonregulated earnings in was primarily due to lower earnings at whiting  business development expenses in international and domestic growth areas and a gain on the sale of an investment in assisted living properties 
partially offsetting these items were improved performance in the energy marketing businesses and the tax benefit resulting from the donation of securities 
electric utility operations electric margins and megawatt hour mwh sales for iec for and were as follows revenues and costs mwhs sold in thousands in thousands change change residential     commercial     industrial     total from ultimate customers     sales for resale     other   total     electric production fuels   purchased power   margin   electric margins and mwh sales for iec for and were as follows revenues and costs mwhs sold in thousands in thousands change change residential     commercial     industrial     total from ultimate customers     sales for resale     other   total     electric production fuels   purchased power   margin   electric margin increased million  or  and million  or  for and  respectively 
the increase for both periods was primarily due to the recovery of concurrent and previously deferred expenditures for iowa mandated energy efficiency programs  reduced purchased power capacity costs at iesu and ipc and higher sales volumes to ultimate customers 
the recovery for energy efficiency programs in iowa is in accordance with iub orders a portion of these recoveries is also amortized to expense in other operation expenses 
electric revenues included increased recoveries for energy efficiency program costs in iowa of million and million for and  respectively 
the increased sales volumes were primarily due to continued economic growth within the iec service territory 
weather normalized sales volumes excluding off system sales increased approximately in compared to an actual increase of 
the increase in margin was partially offset by a lower margin at wp l and rate decreases implemented at wp l and ipc in the lower margin at wp l  which was partially offset by an increase in retail sales  was also due to a purchased power and transmission costs such costs have increased significantly because of stricter reliability requirements and higher transmission costs due to system constraints in wisconsin 
recovery of such increased costs in wisconsin generally involves regulatory lag between the time of the cost increase and the time a rate increase is implemented 
the pscw granted wp l an annual rate increase of million in july related to these cost increases 
in addition  wp l made a filing with the pscw in november seeking another rate increase for higher purchased power and transmission costs 
refer to rates and regulatory matters for a further discussion of this filing 
the effect of these cost increases was partially offset by wp l s reliance on more costly purchased power in the first six months of due to various power plant outages  particularly the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee 
b lower off system sales income due to the transmission constraints  increased native demand  a more active bulk power market  which resulted in lower bulk power margins  and the implementation of a merger related joint sales agreement effective with the consummation of the merger  the margins resulting from iec s off system sales are allocated among iesu  ipc and wp l 
pursuant to rate making provisions  bulk power margins at iesu and ipc are returned to ratepayers through their fuel adjustment clauses 
an increase in off system sales at wp l in also contributed to the margin increase 
the impact of the power plant outages at wp l in and the rate decreases implemented at wp l and ipc in partially offset the margin increase 
iesu s and ipc s electric tariffs include energy adjustment clauses eac that are designed to currently recover the costs of fuel and the energy portion of purchased power billings see note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the eac 
gas utility operations gas margins and dekatherm dth sales for iec for and were as follows revenues and costs dekatherms sold in thousands in thousands change change residential     commercial     industrial     transportation and other     total     cost of gas sold   margin   gas margins and dth sales for iec for and were as follows revenues and costs dekatherms sold in thousands in thousands change change residential     commercial     industrial     transportation and other     total     cost of gas sold   margin   gas margin decreased million  or  and decreased million  or  for and  respectively 
dth sales declined by and for and  respectively  largely due to milder weather 
a rate reduction implemented in april at wp l also contributed to the decrease in margin for and partially offsetting the decline in margin for and were higher revenues from the recovery of concurrent and previously deferred energy efficiency expenditures for iowa mandated energy efficiency program costs in accordance with iub orders a portion of these recoveries is also amortized to expense in other operation expenses and gas cost adjustments at ipc 
gas revenues included increased recoveries for energy efficiency program costs in iowa of million and million for and  respectively 
iesu s and ipc s gas tariffs include purchased gas adjustment pga clauses that are designed to currently recover the cost of utility gas sold see note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the pga 
nonregulated and other revenues nonregulated and other revenues for  and were as follows in millions environmental and engineering services oil and gas production transportation  rents and other nonregulated energy steam affordable housing water the revenues for nonregulated energy declined significantly in primarily due to decreased low margin gas marketing activities and the transfer of the electricity trading business to the cargill joint venture in july  which markets electricity and risk management services to wholesale customers 
iec s investment in the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
oil and gas production revenues declined in primarily due to significantly lower oil and gas prices  largely offset by a significant increase in gas volumes sold 
in  nonregulated energy revenues declined primarily due to the formation of the joint venture with cargill as described above 
transportation  rents and other revenues increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of a gas gathering system in texas in environmental and engineering services revenues declined due to a softening market 
operating expenses other operation expenses for  and were as follows in millions utility wp l iesu ipc nonregulated and other other operation expenses at the utility subsidiaries increased million in  including million of merger related expenses 
the merger related expenses were primarily for employee retirements  separations and relocations 
in addition  increased energy efficiency expenses in iowa  a write off of million of certain employee benefits related regulatory assets at iesu which were deemed no longer probable of recovery  higher administrative and general expenses at wp l  higher injuries and damages expenses and increased expenses for year readiness efforts also contributed to the increase 
the increase was partially offset by reduced employee pension and benefit expenses  reduced conservation expense at wp l  lower costs resulting from merger related operating efficiencies and reduced nuclear operation expenses at iesu 
in  other operation expenses at the utility subsidiaries increased million primarily due to increased amortization of previously deferred energy efficiency expenditures in iowa 
these expenses were partially offset by a reduction in conservation expense at wp l in accordance with an april rate order 
other operation expenses at the nonregulated businesses decreased million in primarily due to the formation of the cargill joint venture 
these reductions in other operation expenses were partially offset by million of merger related costs and continuing expenses for new business development in international and domestic markets 
other operation expenses decreased million in primarily due to the joint venture with cargill and also reduced activity in the environmental and engineering services businesses and the energy marketing business 
these decreases were partially offset by higher operating expenses at whiting 
maintenance expenses decreased slightly in primarily due to reduced expenses at fossil fueled plants  which was virtually offset by increased maintenance at the nuclear plants 
maintenance expenses increased million in primarily due to increased nuclear maintenance expenses  higher transmission and distribution expenses at iesu and increased maintenance at fossil fueled plants 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million and million in and  respectively  primarily as a result of utility property additions 
the increase in was also due to a kewaunee surcharge which is recorded in depreciation and amortization expense with a corresponding increase in revenues resulting in no impact on earnings 
higher depreciation rates implemented at wp l in january and higher depreciation and amortization expenses at whiting also contributed to the increase 
interest expense and other interest expense increased million in due to higher utility and nonregulated borrowings during and an adjustment to decrease interest expense in relating to a tax audit settlement at wp l 
interest expense increased million in primarily due to the change in the amount of debt outstanding 
miscellaneous  net income decreased million in primarily due to million of merger related expenses  for the services of iec s advisors and costs related to iec s name change  and a modest loss from iec s electricity trading joint venture 
gains realized on asset sales in partially offset these items 
the results included a loss incurred on the disposition of an investment at iesu 
the increase in income in was due to costs incurred in related to the successful defense of the hostile takeover attempt at ies 
this was partially offset by the investment disposition loss at iesu in  a gain on the sale of a combustion turbine at wp l in and the gain on a sale of an investment in assisted living properties in income taxes iec s income tax expense decreased million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to lower pre tax income 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the effective tax rate changes 
iesu results of operations overview iesu s earnings available for common stock increased million and decreased million in and  respectively 
the increased earnings for were primarily due to a percent increase in retail electricity sales volumes  largely due to continued economic growth in iesu s service territory  lower purchased power capacity costs  reduced employee pension and benefits costs and lower costs in due to merger related operating efficiencies 
a loss incurred on the disposition of an asset in also improved earnings compared to partially offsetting the higher earnings were merger related expenses  a million write off of a regulatory asset  decreased gas sales resulting from milder weather  increased depreciation and amortization expenses and increased expenses for year readiness efforts 
the decreased earnings for were primarily due to increased operating expenses  higher interest expense and a loss on the investment disposition in such items were partially offset by increased electric sales excluding off system sales resulting from continuing growth in iesu s service territory and the nonrecurrence of costs incurred in related to the successful defense of a hostile takeover attempt of ies by maec

the recovery for energy efficiency programs in iowa is in accordance with iub orders a portion of these recoveries is also amortized to expense in other operation expense 
electric revenues included increased recoveries for energy efficiency program costs of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
sales for resale increased significantly for as a result of the implementation of a merger related joint sales agreement during the second quarter of off system sales revenues are passed through iesu s energy adjustment clause and therefore have no impact on electric margin 
refer to rates and regulatory matters for a further discussion 
the decrease in sales for resale in was primarily due to the implementation of ferc orders and a 
weather normalized sales volumes excluding off system sales increased approximately and in and  respectively  compared to actual increases of and for the same periods

gas revenues included increased recoveries for energy efficient program costs of million and million for and  respectively 
lower grain drying related sales also contributed to the decrease in sales in iesu s gas tariffs include pga clauses that are designed to currently recover the cost of gas sold 
refer to iec s note k of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the pga 
operating expenses iesu s other operation expenses increased million and million for and  respectively 
the increases were primarily due to million of merger related expenses  increased amortization of previously deferred energy efficiency expenditures  a million regulatory asset write off and increased year compliance costs 
the merger related expenses were primarily for employee retirements  separations and relocations 
the regulatory asset write off stemmed from management no longer being able to assert that rate recovery of certain employee benefits costs was probable given the existing merger related price freeze in effect as well as other factors 
these items were partially offset by lower nuclear operation expenses  reduced employee pension and benefit costs and lower costs resulting from merger related operating efficiencies 
the increase in was primarily due to increased amortization of previously deferred energy efficiency expenditures and costs related to an early retirement program  which were partially offset by lower employee labor and benefit costs 
maintenance expenses decreased million and increased million in and  respectively 
the decrease in was due to reduced fossil fueled maintenance expenses  which were partially offset by higher nuclear maintenance expenses 
the increase in was primarily due to increased nuclear maintenance expenses  higher transmission and distribution maintenance expenditures and increased maintenance at the fossil fueled generating stations 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million and million for and  respectively  primarily due to property additions 
interest expense and other interest expense decreased million and increased million in and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increases in the average amount of debt outstanding and changes in interest accruals related to income tax audits 
miscellaneous  net expense increased million and decreased million for and  respectively 
the increase in resulted primarily from million of merger related expenses which were substantially offset by the write off of an investment in and a gain on an asset sale in the decrease in was also due to costs incurred in related to the successful defense of the hostile takeover attempt of ies 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the changes 
wp l results of operations overview wp l s earnings available for common stock decreased million and million in and  respectively 
the decreased earnings for were primarily due to merger related expenses  higher purchased power and transmission costs  higher depreciation and amortization expenses  decreased retail natural gas sales largely due to milder weather  higher injuries and damages expenses  higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate 
these decreases were partially offset by a percent increase in retail electricity sales volumes  largely due to continued economic growth within wp l s service territory  reduced employee pension and benefit costs and lower costs in due to merger related operating efficiencies 
the decreased earnings for were primarily due to lower gas and electric margins  higher depreciation expense  higher interest expense and the recognition of a gain on the sale of a combustion turbine in electric utility operations electric margins and mwh sales for wp l for and were as follows revenues and costs mwhs sold in thousands in thousands change change residential     commercial     industrial     total from ultimate customers     sales for resale     other   total     electric production fuels   purchased power   margin   electric margins and mwh sales for wp l for and were as follows revenues and costs mwhs sold in thousands in thousands change change residential     commercial     industrial     total from ultimate customers     sales for resale     other   total     electric production fuels   purchased power   margin   electric margin decreased million  or  and million  or  during and  respectively 
the decline in margin was due to a purchased power and transmission costs such costs have increased significantly because of stricter reliability requirements and higher transmission costs due to system constraints in wisconsin 
recovery of such increased costs in wisconsin generally involves regulatory lag between the time of the cost increase and the time a rate increase is implemented 
the pscw granted wp l an annual rate increase of million in july related to these cost increases 
in addition  wp l made a filing with the pscw in november seeking another rate increase for higher purchased power and transmission costs 
refer to rates and regulatory matters for a further discussion of this filing 
the effect of these cost increases was partially offset by wp l s reliance on more costly purchased power in the first six months of due to various power plant outages  particularly kewaunee 
b lower off system sales income due to the transmission constraints  increased native demand  a more active bulk power market  which resulted in lower bulk power margins  and the implementation of a merger related joint sales agreement effective with the consummation of the merger  the margins resulting from iec s off system sales are allocated among iesu  ipc and wp l 
a retail rate decrease implemented at wp l in april also contributed to the lower electric margin in the increased sales to ultimate customers  largely due to economic growth in wp l s service territory  partially offset these items 
weather normalized sales volumes excluding off system sales increased approximately in compared to an actual increase of 
the decrease in margin in was due to the rate decrease  milder weather conditions in as compared to and wp l s reliance on more costly purchased power in due to the various power plant outages

in  off system gas revenues were million 
refer to rates and regulatory matters for a discussion of a gas cost adjustment mechanism in place at wp l 
the impact on the results of operations from such mechanism was not significant in any of the periods presented 
operating expenses other operation expense increased million and decreased million for and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to million of merger related expenses for employee retirements  separations and relocations 
higher injuries and damages expenses and an increase in other administrative and general expenses also contributed to the increase 
such items were partially offset by reduced employee pension and benefits expenses  reduced conservation expense and lower costs from merger related operating efficiencies 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in conservation expense  which was partially offset by costs associated with an early retirement program in for eligible bargaining unit employees 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million and million for and  respectively 
the increase was due to property additions  higher kewaunee depreciation refer to capital requirements nuclear facilities for additional information and a kewaunee surcharge of million which has been recorded in depreciation and amortization expense with a corresponding increase in revenues resulting in no impact on earnings 
the increase was due to higher depreciation rates approved by the pscw  effective january   and property additions 
interest expense and other interest expense increased million in primarily due to unusually low interest expense in the second quarter of  resulting from an adjustment to decrease interest expense relating to a tax audit settlement  and increased borrowings during miscellaneous  net income decreased million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to million of merger related expenses which was partially offset by higher earnings on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund 
the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the sale of a combustion turbine in income taxes income taxes decreased million and million in and  respectively  due to lower pre tax income 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the effective tax rate changes 
liquidity and capital resources historical iec analysis cash flows from operating activities at iec increased million and million for and  respectively 
the increases were primarily due to changes in working capital and additional depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by lower net income and lower deferred taxes and investment tax credits 
cash flows used for financing activities decreased million and increased million in and  respectively 
the changes were primarily a result of the net changes in the amount of debt outstanding 
cash flows used for investing activities increased million and decreased million in and  respectively  primarily due to changes in the levels of construction and acquisition expenditures 
the decrease in was partially offset by higher proceeds from the disposition of assets in historical iesu analysis cash flows generated from operating activities increased million and million in and  respectively 
cash flows used for financing activities decreased million and increased million for and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily a result of reduced common stock dividends and the increase in was due to the net change in borrowings in cash flows used for investing activities decreased million and million in and  respectively

historical wp l analysis cash flows generated from operations increased million and decreased million in and  respectively 
the increase was primarily a result of changes in working capital and higher depreciation and amortization expenses partially offset by lower net income 
the decrease in was mainly attributable to the change in working capital 
cash flows used for financing activities increased million and decreased million in and  respectively  primarily due to changes in the amount of debt outstanding 
cash flows used for investing activities increased million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to higher shared savings expenditures and the increase in was mainly due to the proceeds from the sale of other property and equipment in future considerations the capital requirements of iec are primarily attributable to its utility subsidiaries construction and acquisition programs  its debt maturities and business opportunities of alliant energy resources 
it is anticipated that future capital requirements of iec will be met by cash generated from operations and external financing 
the level of cash generated from operations is partially dependent upon economic conditions  legislative activities  environmental matters and timely regulatory recovery of utility costs 
iec s liquidity and capital resources will be affected by costs associated with environmental and regulatory issues 
emerging competition in the utility industry could also impact iec s liquidity and capital resources  as discussed previously in the utility industry outlook section 
at december   alliant energy resources had approximately million of investments in foreign entities 
at december   iesu  wp l and ipc did not have any foreign investments 
iec continues to explore additional international investment opportunities 
such investments may carry a higher level of risk than iec s traditional domestic utility investments or alliant energy resources domestic investments 
such risks could include foreign government actions  foreign economic and currency risks and others 
iec is expected to pursue various potential business development opportunities  including international as well as domestic investments  and is devoting resources to such efforts 
it is anticipated that iec will strive to select investments where the international and other risks are both understood and manageable 
under puhca  iec s investments in exempt wholesale generators ewg s and foreign utility companies fuco s is limited to of iec s consolidated retained earnings 
in addition  there are limitations on the amount of non utility investments iec can make under the wisconsin utility holding company act wuhca as well 
at december   iec had an investment in the stock of mcleodusa inc mcleod  a telecommunications company  valued at million based on a december  closing price of per share and compared to a cost basis of million 
pursuant to the applicable accounting rules  the carrying value of the investments are adjusted to the estimated fair value each quarter based on the closing price at the end of the quarter 
the adjustments do not impact net income as the unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  are recorded directly to the common equity section of the balance sheet and are a component of other comprehensive income 
in addition  any such gains or losses are reflected in current earnings only at the time they are realized through a sale 
iec entered into an agreement in november with mcleod whereby iec s ability to sell the mcleod stock is subject to various restrictions 
iec had certain off balance sheet financial guarantees and commitments outstanding at december  they generally consist of third party borrowing arrangements and lending commitments  guarantees of financial performance of syndicated affordable housing properties and guarantees relating to iec s electricity trading joint venture 
refer to note d of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 
financing and capital structure access to the long term and short term capital and credit markets  and costs of external financing  are dependent on creditworthiness 
the debt ratings of iec and certain subsidiaries by moody s and standard poor s are as follows standard moody s poor s iesu secured long term debt a a unsecured long term debt a a wp l secured long term debt aa aa unsecured long term debt aa a ipc secured long term debt a a unsecured long term debt a a alliant energy resources commercial paper p a iec commercial paper a p a a iesu  wp l and ipc participate in a utility money pool which is funded  as needed  through the issuance of commercial paper by iec 
the pscw has restricted wp l from lending money to non utility affiliates and non wisconsin utilities 
as a result  wp l is restricted from lending money to the utility money pool but is able to borrow money from the utility money pool 
alliant energy resources is a party to a year credit agreement with various banking institutions 
the agreement extends through october  with one year extensions available upon agreement by the parties 
unused borrowing availability under this agreement is also used to support alliant energy resources commercial paper program 
a combined maximum of million of borrowings under this agreement and the commercial paper program may be outstanding at any one time 
interest rates and maturities are set at the time of borrowing 
the rates are based upon quoted market prices and the maturities are less than one year 
at december   alliant energy resources had million of commercial paper outstanding and backed by this facility with interest rates ranging from 
see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of interest rate swaps alliant energy resources has entered into relative to million of short term borrowings under  or backed by  this agreement 
alliant energy resources intends to continue issuing commercial paper backed by this facility and no conditions existed at december  that would prevent the issuance of commercial paper or direct borrowings on its bank lines 
accordingly  this debt is classified as long term 
in addition  alliant energy resources has in place a million day credit agreement which is described below 
other than periodic sinking fund requirements  which will not require additional cash expenditures  the following long term debt in millions will mature prior to december  iesu ipc wp l alliant energy resources iec depending upon market conditions  it is currently anticipated that a majority of the maturing debt will be refinanced with the issuance of long term securities 
wp l currently has no authority from the pscw or the securities and exchange commission sec to issue additional long term debt 
on november   iesu and ipc received authority from the sec under puhca to issue million and million of long term debt securities  respectively 
the companies continually evaluate their future financing needs and will make any necessary regulatory filings as needed 
under the most restrictive terms of their respective indentures  iesu  wp l and ipc could have issued at least million  million and million of long term debt at december   respectively 
on october   wp l issued million of debentures at a coupon rate of maturing on october  the net proceeds from the debt offering were used to pay down short term debt  including short term debt used to retire maturing long term debt 
on november   ipc issued million and million of pollution control revenue bonds due november  and november   respectively 
the proceeds were used to retire at maturity million of pollution control revenue bonds 
the bonds have a fixed interest rate of for the first five years 
thereafter  ipc will have the option to reset the interest rate at one of three variable short term interest rates or at a new long term interest rate  based on the then prevailing market conditions  provided the rate does not exceed per annum 
on november   iesu issued million of pollution control revenue bonds due november  the proceeds were used to refinance million of pollution control revenue bonds that were due serially through the bonds have a fixed rate of for the first five years 
thereafter  iesu will have the option to reset the interest rate at one of three variable short term interest rates or at a new long term interest rate  based on the then prevailing market conditions  provided the rate does not exceed per annum 
the various charter provisions of the entities identified below authorize and limit the aggregate amount of additional shares of cumulative preferred stock and cumulative preference stock that may be issued 
at december   the companies could have issued the following additional shares of cumulative preferred or preference stock iesu wp l ipc cumulative preferred   cumulative preference   for interim financing  iesu  wp l and ipc were authorized by the applicable federal or state regulatory agency to issue short term debt as follows in millions at december  iesu wp l ipc regulatory authorization short term debt outstanding external parties short term debt outstanding money pool in addition to the short term debt outstanding at its utility subsidiaries  iec had an additional million of short term debt outstanding at december  in addition to providing for ongoing working capital needs  this availability of short term financing provides the companies flexibility in the issuance of long term securities 
the level of short term borrowing fluctuates based on seasonal corporate needs  the timing of long term financing  and capital market conditions 
to maintain flexibility in its capital structure and to take advantage of favorable short term rates  iesu and wp l also use proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues to finance a portion of their long term cash needs 
iec anticipates that short term debt will continue to be available at reasonable costs due to current ratings by independent utility analysts and rating services 
alliant energy resources is also a party to a day credit agreement with various banking institutions 
the agreement extends through october   with day extensions available upon agreement by the parties 
the unborrowed portion of this agreement is also used to support alliant energy resources commercial paper program 
a combined maximum of million of borrowings under this agreement and commercial paper backed by this facility may be outstanding at any one time 
interest rates and maturities are set at the time of borrowing 
the rates are based upon quoted market prices and the maturities are less than one year 
there were no borrowings under this facility at december  in addition to the aforementioned borrowing capability under alliant energy resources credit agreements  iec has million of bank lines of credit  of which none was utilized at december   available for direct borrowing or to support commercial paper 
commitment fees are paid to maintain these lines and there are no conditions which restrict the unused lines of credit 
from time to time  iec may borrow from banks and other financial institutions on as offered credit lines in lieu of commercial paper  and has agreements with several financial institutions for such borrowings 
there are no commitment fees associated with these agreements and there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements at december  iec made a filing with the sec in february under puhca to provide iec with  among other things  broad authorization over the next three years to issue stock and debt  provide guarantees  acquire energy related assets and enter into interest rate hedging transactions 
given the above financing flexibility  including iec s access to both the debt and equity securities markets  management believes it has the necessary financing capabilities in place to adequately finance its capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
capital requirements general capital expenditure and investment and financing plans are subject to continual review and change 
the capital expenditure and investment programs may be revised significantly as a result of many considerations  including changes in economic conditions  variations in actual sales and load growth compared to forecasts  requirements of environmental  nuclear and other regulatory authorities  acquisition and business combination opportunities  the availability of alternate energy and purchased power sources  the ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief  escalations in construction costs and conservation and energy efficiency programs 
construction and acquisition expenditures for iec for the year ended december  were million  compared with million for the year ended december  iec s anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million  consisting of approximately million in its utility operations  million for energy related international investments and million for new business development initiatives at alliant energy resources 
iec s anticipated utility construction and acquisition expenditures for is made up of for electric transmission and distribution  for electric generation  for information technology and for miscellaneous electric  gas  water and steam projects 
the level of domestic and international investments could vary significantly from the estimates noted here depending on actual investment opportunities  timing of the opportunities and the receipt of regulatory approvals to exceed limitations in place under wuhca and puhca on the amount of iec s non utility investments 
it is expected that iec will spend approximately billion on utility construction and acquisition expenditures during  including expenditures to comply with nitrogen oxides nox emissions reductions in wisconsin as discussed in other matters environmental 
it is expected that alliant energy resources will invest in energy products and services in domestic and international markets  industrial services initiatives and other strategic initiatives during iesu s construction and acquisition expenditures for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
iesu s anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million  of which represents expenditures for electric transmission and distribution facilities  represents generation expenditures  represents information technology expenditures and the remaining represents miscellaneous electric  gas  steam and general expenditures 
iesu s levels of utility construction and acquisition expenditures are projected to be million in  million in  million in and million in wp l s construction and acquisition expenditures for the years ended december  and were and million  respectively 
wp l s anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million  of which represents expenditures for electric transmission and distribution facilities  represents generation expenditures  represents information technology expenditures and the remaining represents miscellaneous electric  gas  water and general expenditures 
wp l s construction and acquisition expenditures are projected to be million in  million in  million in and million in which include expenditures to comply with nitrogen oxides nox emissions reductions as discussed in other matters environmental 
iec anticipates financing utility construction expenditures during through internally generated funds supplemented  when required  by outside financing 
funding of a majority of the alliant energy resources construction and acquisition expenditures is expected to be completed with external financings 
nuclear facilities iec owns interests in two nuclear facilities  kewaunee and the duane arnold energy center daec 
set forth below is a discussion of certain matters impacting these facilities 
kewaunee  a megawatt pressurized water reactor plant  is operated by wisconsin public service corporation wpsc and is jointly owned by wpsc  wp l  and madison gas and electric company mg e 
the kewaunee operating license expires in on april   the pscw approved wpsc s application for replacement of the two steam generators at kewaunee 
the total cost of replacing the steam generators would be approximately million  with wp l s share of the cost being approximately million 
the replacement work is tentatively planned for the spring of and will take approximately days 
on july   the pscw approved an agreement between the owners of kewaunee which provides for wpsc to assume the kewaunee ownership share currently held by mg e prior to work beginning on the replacement of steam generators 
on september   wpsc and mg e finalized an arrangement in which wpsc will acquire mg e s share of kewaunee 
this agreement  the closing of which is contingent upon the steam generator replacement  will give wpsc ownership in kewaunee 
after the change in ownership  wpsc and wp l will be responsible for the decommissioning of the plant 
wpsc and wp l are discussing revisions to the joint power supply agreement which will govern operation of the plant after the ownership change takes place 
on october   kewaunee was shut down for a planned maintenance and refueling outage 
inspection of the plant s two steam generators shows that the repairs made in are holding up well and few additional repairs were needed 
in addition to the inspection and repairs of the steam generator  a major overhaul was performed on the main turbine generator 
the plant was back in operation on november  prior to the july  pscw decision  the pscw had directed the owners of kewaunee to record depreciation and decommissioning cost levels based on an expected plant end of life of versus a license end of life of this was prompted by the uncertainty regarding the expected useful life of the plant without steam generator replacement 
the revised end of life of resulted in higher depreciation and decommissioning expense at wp l beginning in may  in accordance with the pscw rate order ur this level of depreciation will remain in effect until the steam generator replacement is completed at which time the entire plant will be depreciated over years using an accelerated method 
at december   the net carrying amount of wp l s investment in kewaunee was approximately million 
wp l s retail customers in wisconsin are responsible for approximately of wp l s share of kewaunee costs see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
daec  a megawatt boiling water reactor plant  is operated by iesu which has a ownership interest in the plant 
the daec operating license expires in pursuant to the most recent electric rate case order  the iub allows iesu to currently recover million annually for iesu s share of the cost to decommission daec 
the current recovery figures are based on an assumed cost to decommission daec of million  which is iesu s portion in dollars  based on the nuclear regulatory commission nrc minimum formula which exceeds the amount in the site specific study completed in 
at december   iesu had million invested in external decommissioning trust funds and also had an internal decommissioning reserve of million recorded as accumulated depreciation 
iesu s share of the estimated cost to decommission daec based on the most recent site specific study completed in is million  in dollars 
this study includes the costs to terminate daec s nrc license and to return the site to a greenfield condition 
iesu s share of the estimated cost to decommission daec based on the most recent nrc minimum formula is in dollars 
the nrc minimum formula is intended to apply only to the cost of terminating daec s nrc license 
the additional decommissioning expense funding requirements which should result from these updated studies are not reflected in iesu s rates 
in february  iec  nsp  wpsc and wisconsin electric power co 
announced the formation of a nuclear management company nmc to sustain long term safety  optimize reliability and improve the operational performance of their nuclear generating plants 
combined  the four utilities operate seven nuclear generating plants at five locations 
iec s participation in the nmc is contingent on approval from the sec under puhca 
each utility will be required to obtain various other state or federal regulatory approvals prior to its participation in the nmc 
in addition  nrc approval is required if any utilities choose to transfer their operating license to the new company 
as presently proposed  the utilities would continue to own their plants  be entitled to energy generated at the plants and retain the financial obligations for their safe operation  maintenance and decommissioning 
refer to the other matters environmental section for a discussion of various issues impacting iec s future capital requirements 
rates and regulatory matters in november  as part of its merger approval  ferc accepted a proposal by iesu  wp l  and ipc  which provides for a four year freeze on wholesale electric prices beginning with the effective date of the merger 
in association with the merger  iesu  wp l and ipc entered into a system coordination and operating agreement which became effective with the consummation of the merger 
the agreement  which has been approved by the ferc  provides a contractual basis for coordinated planning  construction  operation and maintenance of the interconnected electric generation and transmission systems of the three utility companies 
in addition  the agreement allows the interconnected system to be operated as a single control area with off system capacity sales and purchases made to market excess system capability or to meet system capability deficiencies 
such sales and purchases are allocated among the three utility companies based on procedures included in the agreement 
the procedures were approved by both the ferc and all state regulatory bodies having jurisdiction over these sales 
iesu in september  iesu agreed with the iub to provide iowa customers a four year retail electric and gas price freeze commencing on the effective date of the merger 
the agreement excluded price changes due to government mandated programs such as energy efficiency cost recovery  the electric fuel adjustment clause and pga clause and unforeseen dramatic changes in operations 
in addition  the price freeze does not preclude a review by either the iub or office of consumer advocate oca into whether iesu is exceeding a reasonable return on common equity 
refer to the utility industry outlook section for a discussion of possible legislation to be introduced in iowa regarding restructuring the electric utility industry 
under provisions of the iub rules  iesu is currently recovering the costs it has incurred for its energy efficiency programs 
generally  the costs incurred through july are being recovered over various four year periods 
statutory changes implemented by the iub in allowed iesu to begin concurrent recovery of its prospective expenditures on august  the implementation of these changes will gradually eliminate the regulatory asset that was created under the prior rate making mechanism as these costs are recovered 
wp l in connection with its approval of the merger  the pscw accepted a wp l proposal to freeze rates for four years following the date of the merger 
a re opening of an investigation into wp l s rates during the rate freeze period  for both cost increases and decreases  may occur only for single events that are not merger related and have a revenue requirement impact of million or more 
in addition  the electric fuel adjustment clause and pga clause are not affected by the rate freezes 
in rate order ur  the pscw approved new rates effective april  on average  wp l s retail electric rates under the new rate order declined by and retail gas rates declined by 
in addition  the pscw ordered that it must approve the payment of dividends by wp l to iec that are in excess of the level forecasted in the rate order million  if such dividends would reduce wp l s average common equity ratio below of total capitalization 
the dividends paid by wp l to iec since the rate order was issued have not exceeded the level forecasted in the rate order 
the retail electric rates are based in part on forecasted fuel and purchased power costs 
under pscw rules  wisconsin utilities can seek emergency rate increases if the annual costs are more than higher than the estimated costs used to establish rates 
in march  wp l requested an electric rate increase to cover purchased power and transmission costs that have increased due to transmission constraints and electric reliability concerns in the midwest 
on july   the pscw granted a retail electric rate increase of million annually that was effective on july  in november  wp l requested another electric rate increase to cover additional increases in purchased power and transmission costs 
in early march  the pscw granted a retail electric rate increase of million 
the additional revenues collected are subject to refund if wp l s earnings exceed its authorized return on equity 
the gas performance incentive includes a sharing mechanism  whereby of all gains and losses relative to current commodity prices as well as other benchmarks are retained by wp l rather than refunded to or recovered from customers 
rate order ur also provided for the recovery of costs associated with wp l s energy efficiency programs  including the recovery of the cost of capital associated with advances made to customers to install energy efficient equipment 
in may  the pscw approved the deferral of certain costs associated with the year issue and in november  wp l filed for rate recovery of million related to the wisconsin retail portion of year costs 
a pre hearing conference was held in january and hearings are scheduled for may management anticipates receiving an order by the end of the second quarter of in january  wp l made a filing with the pscw proposing to begin deferring  on january   all costs associated with the united states environmental protection agency s epa required nox emission reductions 
wp l has requested recovery of all the nox reduction costs through a surcharge mechanism 
wp l anticipates receiving a final order in this proceeding in late or early refer to the other matters environmental section for a further discussion of the nox issue 
refer to nuclear facilities for a discussion of several pscw rulings regarding kewaunee 
ipc in september  ipc agreed with the iub to provide iowa customers a four year retail electric and gas price freeze commencing on the effective date of the merger 
the agreement excluded price changes due to government mandated programs such as energy efficiency cost recovery  the electric fuel adjustment clause and pga clause and unforeseen dramatic changes in operations 
in addition  the price freeze does not preclude a review by either the iub or oca into whether ipc is exceeding a reasonable return on common equity 
ipc also agreed with the mpuc and icc to four year and three year rate freezes  respectively  commencing on the effective date of the merger 
refer to the utility industry outlook section for a discussion of possible legislation to be introduced in iowa regarding restructuring the electric utility industry 
on september   the iub approved a settlement between ipc and the oca which provided for an electric rate reduction in annual revenues of approximately million 
the reduction applied to all bills rendered on and after october  ipc is also recovering its energy efficiency costs in iowa in a similar manner as iesu and began its concurrent cost recovery in october assuming capture of the merger related synergies and no significant legislative or regulatory changes negatively affecting its utility subsidiaries  iec does not expect the merger related electric and gas price freezes to have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
other matters year overview iec utilizes software  embedded systems and related technologies throughout its business that will be affected by the date change in the year the year problem exists because many computerized operating systems  applications  databases and embedded systems use a standard two digit year field instead of four digits to reference a given year 
for example  in the date field would actually represent as a result  information technology and embedded systems may not properly recognize the year or process data correctly  potentially causing data inaccuracies  operational malfunctions or operational failures 
following up on earlier work  iec formally established a company wide project team in to assess  remediate and communicate its year issues as well as develop the necessary contingency plans 
expertise on the team has been drawn from various areas  including  but not limited to  information technology  engineering  communications  internal audits  legal  facilities  supply chain  finance  and project management 
a full time project manager heads up a team of approximately employees who are dedicated to the team full time and another employees are working on the project on a part time basis 
in addition  there are approximately individuals from external consulting firms who are also providing various year related services for the project team 
status reports are provided to senior management monthly and at every meeting of iec s board of directors 
auditing of the year inventory  remediation efforts and contingency planning is being done by the internal audits department 
iec has also retained an outside third party to assess and evaluate its year project 
the various phases of and other matters relating to the year project are described below 
assessment a company wide inventory has been completed for information technology hardware  software  databases  network infrastructure operating systems and embedded systems computers or microprocessors that run specialized software 
inventoried devices and systems have been assessed and prioritized into three categories based on the relative critical nature of their business function safety related  critical business continuity related  and non critical 
remediation and testing iec s approach to remediation is to repair  replace or retire the affected devices and systems 
remediation and testing of safety related and critical business continuity related devices and systems is underway in all business units 
in some cases iec s ability to meet its target date for remediation is dependent upon the timely provision of necessary upgrades and modifications by its software vendors 
as of december   iec was expecting upgrades from embedded system vendors and information technology vendors 
should these upgrades be delayed it would impact iec s ability to meet its target date 
at this time  iec does not expect that these upgrades will be delayed 
as part of the testing process  client server applications are being tested in an isolated test lab on year compliant hardware and software 
also  iec intends to implement a process to protect the integrity of the data once it is year compliant 
a 
embedded systems the project team is using testing standards and procedures based on those developed in the national electric utility industry effort led by the electric power research institute epri 
the team is also using information and testing guidance received from iec s vendors 
iec is participating in epri s year collaborative effort to share information about test procedures  test results and vendor information 
the project team is also working with equipment vendors to ascertain year compliance with systems and devices 
testing methodology includes a power on off test and testing for critical dates including  and all testing for assessing year compliance has been completed 
the only testing remaining is post remediation testing 
the goal is to complete remediation testing work for the embedded systems by march   approximately of this remediation testing work has been completed as of the end of experience to date suggests that year problems in embedded systems are occurring at a lower rate than originally anticipated 
for iec  of embedded systems have been identified as year problematic 
this rate is generally consistent in both volume and by type of device with other similar sized electric utilities participating in epri s year embedded system program 
b 
information technology iec s information technology year readiness project consists of both application and operating systems  and infrastructure pc  servers  printers  etc 
components 
the inventory and assessment of both the systems and the infrastructure has been completed 
iec s goal is to complete the remediation and testing of the systems by march  and the infrastructure components by june  at the end of  approximately of the systems and of the infrastructure components have been remediated and tested 
iec s customer information systems and financial systems make up the majority of the remediation and testing effort remaining 
the remediation and testing of the customer information systems was complete at the end of with an anticipated completion date of may  the financial systems have been remediated with final roll forward testing scheduled to be completed by mid year therefore  it is anticipated that iec will have its information technology remediation and testing efforts complete by march  with work completed and into production by mid year costs to address year compliance iec s historical year project expenditures as well as current estimates for the remaining costs to be incurred on the project are as follows incremental costs  in millions description total iesu wp l other costs incurred from current estimate of remaining modifications in addition  the company estimates it incurred million in costs for internal labor and associated overheads in and anticipates expenditures of million in while work was done on the year project prior to  iec did not begin tracking the costs separately until in accordance with an order received from the pscw  wp l began deferring its year project costs  other than internal labor and associated overheads  in may approximately million of the expenditures incurred at wp l for the months ended december  have been deferred 
refer to liquidity and capital resources rates and regulatory matters for a further discussion 
iec expects to fund its year expenditures through internal sources 
other than the costs being deferred by wp l pursuant to the pscw order  iec is expensing all the year costs noted above 
communications third party assessment iec is heavily dependent on other utilities including electric  gas  telecommunications and water utilities and its suppliers 
an effort is underway to communicate with such parties to increase their awareness of year issues and monitor and assess  to the extent possible  their year readiness 
iec has sought written assurance that third parties with significant relationships with iec will be year ready 
as part of an extensive awareness effort  iec is also communicating with its utility customers  regulatory agencies  elected and appointed government officials  and industry groups 
iec executives and account managers are also having discussions with iec s largest customers to review their initiatives for year readiness 
iec is also working closely with the north american electric reliability council nerc and the natural gas council to assist their efforts to make certain all system interconnections across regional areas are year compliant 
risks and contingency planning the systems which pose the greatest year risks for iec if the year project is not successful are the telecommunications facilities and network systems as well as the information technology systems 
the potential problems related to these systems include service interruptions  service order and billing delays and the resulting customer relations and cash flow issues 
iec is currently unable to quantify the financial impact of such contingencies if in fact they were to occur 
even though iec intends to complete the bulk of its year remediation and testing activities by the end of march and has initiated year communications with significant customers  key vendors  suppliers  and other parties material to iec s operation  failures or delay in achieving year compliance could significantly disrupt iec s business 
therefore  iec has initiated contingency planning to address alternatives in the event of a year failure that occurs within iec or where iec is impacted by an external year failure 
the plan will address mission critical processes  devices and systems and will include training  testing and rehearsal of procedures  and the need for installation of backup equipment as necessary 
the goal is to have the contingency plan completed by mid year as a member of mid america interconnected network  inc main  iec is also working with the operating committee yk task force which will expand existing emergency operating strategies for member company control centers to ensure rapid responses to any year related electric system disturbances and will coordinate those strategies with other reliability organizations 
main is one of the regional coordinating councils that make up nerc 
iec also belongs to the mid continent area power pool mapp  another one of the nerc councils  and will be coordinating year contingency planning with mapp as well 
as part of its contingency planning process  nerc has scheduled two nation wide electric utility industry drills in april and september these drills will focus on safe and reliable electrical system operations with the partial loss of telecommunications 
in addition to these nerc drills  iec will be conducting three additional internal drills 
these will include a march table top drill  a june functional drill and an august full scale development drill where key employees will test and critique iec s contingency plans 
since early  iec has devoted a significant portion of its information technology resources to the year project given the importance of such project to the continued operations of iec 
as a result  there have been some delays in implementing other information technology projects 
the delays are simply a matter of timing and iec does not currently believe that such delays will have a material adverse impact on its results of operations or financial position 
summary based on iec s current schedule for completion of its year tasks  iec believes its plan is adequate to secure year readiness of its critical systems 
nevertheless  achieving year readiness is subject to many risks and uncertainties  as described above 
if iec  or third parties  fail to achieve year readiness with respect to critical systems and  as such  there are systematic problems  there could be a material adverse effect on iec s results of operations and financial condition 
labor issues the status of the collective bargaining agreements at each of the utilities is as follows at december  iesu wp l ipc number of collective bargaining agreements percentage of workforce covered by agreements eight agreements are scheduled to expire in and represent substantially all employees covered under collective bargaining agreements 
these employees represent approximately of all iec employees 
iec has not experienced any significant work stoppage problems in the past 
while negotiations have commenced  iec is currently unable to predict the outcome of these negotiations 
market risk sensitive instruments and positions iec  through its consolidated subsidiaries  has historically had only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and has not used them for speculative purposes 
they have been used to manage well defined interest rate and commodity price risks 
wp l and alliant energy resources have historically entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
the total notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at wp l and alliant energy resources at december   was million and million  respectively 
see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
whiting is exposed to market risk in the pricing of its oil and gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile because of seasonal weather patterns  supply and demand factors  transportation availability and price  and general economic conditions 
worldwide political developments have historically also had an impact on oil prices 
in the past  iec generally has not utilized derivative instruments designed to reduce its exposure to these price fluctuations and no such positions were outstanding at december  however  during  iec has entered into a limited amount of transactions involving a collar strategy for a portion of whiting s gas production 
as discussed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements  from time to time wp l utilizes gas commodity swap arrangements to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations on gas purchased and injected into storage during the summer months and withdrawn and sold at current prices during the winter months 
while it is not wp l s intent to terminate the contracts currently in place  the impact of a termination of all the agreements outstanding at december   would have been an estimated gain of million 
wp l has entered into a weather insurance agreement which terminates march   for the purpose of hedging a portion of the risk associated with the changes in weather from normal conditions 
under this agreement  a payment will be made or received if the heating degree days from november  to march   fall outside certain pre determined heating degree levels 
the payment is limited to a maximum of million 
at december   the fair value of this agreement if it were terminated would have resulted in a payment to wp l of an estimated million 
in the course of alliant energy resource s gas marketing activities  it enters into fixed price sales commitments to customers and purchases the corresponding physical supplies at fixed prices from a third party provider to lock in the related margin on the sale 
the risk associated with gas price fluctuations is managed by closely matching purchases from suppliers with the sales commitments to the customers 
there were no derivative positions outstanding at december  while iec is exposed to credit risk when it enters into a hedging transaction  it has established procedures and policies designed to mitigate such risks due to a counterparty default 
iec utilizes a listing of approved counterparties and monitors the creditworthiness on an ongoing basis 
iec s investments in china and new zealand are valued in renminbi rmb and in new zealand nz dollars  respectively 
as a result  these investments are subject to currency exchange risk when the investments are translated into us dollars 
during  the rmb remained stable as compared to the us dollar  however  the nz dollar decreased in value in relation to the us dollar 
at december   iec had a cumulative million foreign currency translation loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on its consolidated balance sheets which primarily related to decreases in the nz dollar in relation to the us dollar 
at december   iec had an investment in the stock of mcleod  a telecommunications company  valued at million based on a december  closing price of per share and compared to a cost basis of million 
pursuant to the applicable accounting rules  the carrying value of the investments are adjusted to the estimated fair value each quarter based on the closing price at the end of the quarter 
iec entered into an agreement in november with mcleod whereby iec s ability to sell the mcleod stock is subject to various restrictions 
iec has a interest in an electricity trading joint venture with cargill which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the joint venture s trading activities principally consist of marketing and trading over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
the majority of the forward contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell electricity at fixed prices in the future and require settlement by physical delivery of electricity or are netted out in accordance with industry trading standards 
the market risk exposure of the joint venture for its forward contracts outstanding at december   was not significant 
in addition  cargill has made guarantees to certain counterparties regarding the performance of contracts entered into by the joint venture 
guarantees of approximately million have been issued of which approximately million were outstanding at december  under the terms of the joint venture agreement  any payments required under the guarantees would be shared by iec and cargill on a basis to the extent the joint venture is not able to reimburse the guarantor for payments made under the guarantee 
accounting pronouncements in february  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop addresses  among other things  expensing versus capitalization of costs  accounting for the costs incurred in the upgrading of the software and amortizing the capitalized cost of software 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  iec adopted the requirements of this statement in and such adoption did not have any significant impact on its financial statements 
in april  the aicpa issued sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
this sop provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up costs and organization costs 
costs of start up activities and organization costs are required to be expensed as incurred 
the statement is effective for periods beginning after december  iec adopted the requirements of this statement in and such adoption did not have any significant impact on its financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired  or substantively modified after december  iec has not yet quantified the impacts of sfas on the financial statements and has not determined the timing of or method of adoption of sfas however  the statement could increase volatility in earnings and other comprehensive income 
in december  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf issue 
eitf issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and requires energy trading contracts to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet  with the changes in fair value included in earnings 
iec anticipates that the adoption of eitf issue will not have a significant impact on iec s financial statements based on its current operations 
accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets the staff of the sec has questioned certain of the current accounting practices of the electric utility industry  including iesu and wp l  regarding the recognition  measurement and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in financial statements of electric utilities 
in response to these questions  the fasb is reviewing the accounting for closure and removal costs  including decommissioning of nuclear power plants 
if current electric utility industry accounting practices for nuclear power plant decommissioning are changed  the annual provision for decommissioning could increase relative to  and the estimated cost for decommissioning could be recorded as a liability rather than as accumulated depreciation  with recognition of an increase in the cost of the related nuclear power plant 
assuming no significant change in regulatory treatment  iesu and wp l do not believe that such changes  if required  would have an adverse effect on their financial position or results of operations due to their ability to recover decommissioning costs through rates 
inflation iec  iesu and wp l do not expect the effects of inflation at current levels to have a significant effect on their financial position or results of operations 
environmental the pollution abatement programs of iesu  wp l  ipc and alliant energy resources are subject to continuing review and are revised from time to time due to changes in environmental regulations  changes in construction plans and escalation of construction costs 
while management cannot precisely forecast the effect of future environmental regulations on iec s operations  it has taken steps to anticipate the future while also meeting the requirements of current environmental regulations 
the clean air act amendments of act require emission reductions of sulfur dioxide so  nox and other air pollutants to achieve reductions of atmospheric chemicals believed to cause acid rain 
iesu  wp l and ipc have met the provisions of phase i of the act and are in the process of meeting the requirements of phase ii of the act effective in the year 
the act also governs so allowances  which are defined as an authorization for an owner to emit one ton of so into the atmosphere 
the companies are reviewing their options to ensure they will have sufficient allowances to offset their emissions in the future 
the companies believe that the potential costs of complying with these provisions of title iv of the act will not have a material adverse impact on their financial position or results of operations 
the act and other federal laws also require the epa to study and regulate  if necessary  additional issues that potentially affect the electric utility industry  including emissions relating to ozone transport  mercury and particulate control as well as modifications to the polychlorinated biphenyl pcb rules 
in july  the epa issued final rules that would tighten the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter emissions and in june  the epa modified the pcb rules 
iec cannot predict the long term consequences of these rules on its results of operations or financial condition 
in october  the epa issued a final rule requiring states  including wisconsin  to modify their state implementation plans sips to address the ozone transport issue 
the implementation of the rule will likely require wp l to reduce its nox emissions at all of its plants to 
lbs mmbtu by wp l is currently evaluating various options to meet the emission levels 
these options include fuel switching  operational modifications and capital investments 
based on existing technology  the preliminary estimates indicate that capital investments will be approximately million 
refer to the rates and regulatory matters section for a discussion of a filing wp l made with the pscw regarding rate recovery of these costs 
revisions to the wisconsin administrative code have been proposed that could have a significant impact on wp l s operation of the rock river generating station in beloit  wisconsin 
the proposed revisions will affect the amount of heat that the generating station can discharge into the rock river 
wp l cannot presently predict the final outcome of the rule  but believes that  as the rule is currently proposed  the capital investments and or modifications required to meet the proposed discharge limits could be significant 
pursuant to a routine internal review of documents  iesu determined that certain changes undertaken during previous years at one of its generating facilities may have required a federal prevention of significant deterioration psd permit 
iesu initiated discussions with its regulators on the matter  resulting in the submittal of a psd permit application in february iesu received the permit in the second quarter of iesu may be subject to a penalty for not having obtained the permit previously  however  iesu believes that any likely actions resulting from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operation 
pursuant to a separate routine internal review of plant operations  iesu determined that certain permit limits were exceeded in at one of its generating facilities in cedar rapids  iowa 
iesu has initiated discussions with its regulators on the matter and has proposed a compliance plan which includes equipment modifications and contemplates operational changes 
on may   iesu received a citation from the linn county health department alleging violations at the facility 
iesu has negotiated a settlement agreement with the linn county health department  resolving the matter for  the settlement was reviewed and approved by a local court with appropriate jurisdiction during the third quarter of on february   iesu received a letter from the iowa department of natural resources idnr stating that idnr will require the iesu customer served by this facility to obtain a psd permit for the facility 
iesu is currently evaluating the ramifications of this idnr decision  and formulating a response 
however  management believes that any likely actions resulting from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on iesu s financial position or results of operations 
in march and january  ipc received notices of intent to sue from an environmental group alleging certain violations of effluent limits  established pursuant to the clean water act  at ipc s generating facility in clinton  iowa 
on may   ipc received from the idnr an inspection report and notice of violation addressing the same and other concerns as were raised by the environmental group 
ipc responded to the environmental group on may   providing an evaluation of the alleged violations 
ipc responded to the idnr on june  with a plan of action addressing the idnr s concerns 
ipc responded to the environmental group again on february   stating that all of the alleged violations were either already resolved or invalid 
while ipc believes that it has satisfied idnr s concerns  it may be subject to a penalty for exceeding permit limits established for this facility  however  management believes that any likely actions resulting from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on ipc s financial position or results of operations 
pursuant to an internal review of operations  ipc discovered that unit no 
at its generating facility in dubuque  iowa  may require a clean air act acid rain permit and continuous emissions monitoring system cems 
ipc has initiated discussions with the regulators  has discontinued operation of the unit pending resolution of the issues  and will be installing a cems on the unit and will be applying for an acid rain permit 
pursuant to its internal review  ipc also identified and disclosed to regulators a potentially similar situation at its lansing  iowa generating facility  and will potentially be installing cems and applying for acid rain permits for these units as well  pending the outcome of regulatory review 
ipc may be subject to a penalty for not having installed the cems and for not having obtained the permit previously 
however  ipc believes that any likely actions resulting from this matter will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations 
a global treaty has been negotiated that could require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from utility plants 
in november  the united states signed the treaty and agreed with the other countries to resolve all remaining issues by the end of at this time  management is unable to predict whether the united states congress will ratify the treaty 
given the uncertainty of the treaty ratification and the ultimate terms of the final regulations  management cannot currently estimate the impact the implementation of the treaty would have on iec s operations 
the low level radioactive waste policy amendments act of mandates that each state must take responsibility for the storage of low level radioactive waste produced within its borders 
the states of iowa and wisconsin are members of the six state midwest interstate low level radioactive waste compact compact which is responsible for development of any new disposal capability within the compact member states 
in june  the compact commissioners voted to discontinue work on a proposed waste disposal facility in the state of ohio because the expected cost of such a facility was comparably higher than other options currently available 
dwindling waste volumes and continued access to existing disposal facilities were also reasons cited for the decision 
a disposal facility located near barnwell  south carolina continues to accept the low level waste and iesu and wp l currently ship the waste each produces to such site  thereby minimizing the amount of low level waste stored on site 
in addition  given technological advances  waste compaction and the reduction in the amount of waste generated  daec and kewaunee each have on site storage capability sufficient to store low level waste expected to be generated over at least the next ten years  with continuing access to the barnwell disposal facility extending that on site storage capability indefinitely 
see notes f and g of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of iec s environmental issues 
power supply the power supply concerns of have raised awareness of the electric system reliability challenges facing wisconsin and the midwest region 
as a result  wisconsin enacted electric reliability legislation in april wisconsin reliability act 
the legislation has the goal of assuring reliable electric energy for wisconsin 
the new law  effective may   requires wisconsin utilities to join a regional independent system operator for transmission by the year  allows the construction of merchant power plants in the state and streamlines the regulatory approval process for building new generation and transmission facilities 
as a requirement of the legislation  the pscw completed a regional transmission constraint study 
the pscw is authorized to order construction of new transmission facilities  based on the findings of its constraint study  through december  on september   the pscw ordered wp l and two other wisconsin utilities to arrange for additional electric capacity to help maintain reliable service for their customers 
in july  iec and polsky energy corp 
polsky announced an agreement whereby polsky would build  own and operate a power plant in southeastern wisconsin capable of producing up to megawatts mw of electricity reduced from earlier estimates of mw due to nox emissions limitations imposed by the wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr 
under the agreement  iec will purchase the capacity to meet the electric needs of its utility customers  as outlined by the wisconsin reliability act 
it is expected that this new power plant will be operational in june the pscw issued an order dated december  approving the project 
utility officials noted that it will take time for new transmission and power plant projects to be approved and built 
while utility officials fully expect to meet customer demands in  problems still could arise if there are unexpected power plant outages  transmission system outages or extended periods of extremely hot weather
