results of operations compared with sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or approximately over the amount of million 
century contributed million of this increase due largely to favorable economic and weather conditions in most of its market areas and to geographical expansion relating to acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of presently  century has more than branches 
cbe s sales in have increased more than over levels principally due to market growth 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or approximately over the amount of million 
this increase is due primarily to the higher sales noted above 
the overall gross profit percentage of sales declined slightly to due in part to the overall competitive conditions in the irrigation market 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million or of sales to million from million for the year ended december  the full year effect of the geographical expansion resulting from acquisitions made during at century noted above accounted for a major portion of this increase 
interest expense  net for the year ended december  increased 
million to million 
this increase reflects the higher borrowings under the line of credit facility incurred in carrying the higher working capital 
the federal  state and foreign income tax provision for the year ended december  was million  an increase of approximately 
million from last year 
the higher taxes are due to higher income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share diluted 
this compares with million or 
per share diluted reported for the year ended december  compared with sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or approximately over the amount of million 
century contributed million of this increase due largely to favorable economic and weather conditions in most of it s market areas and to geographical expansion principally in the east and south east sections of the country 
in  century had branches 
cbe s sales in have increased more that over levels principally due to expansion through the acquisition made a year ago in maine and in los angeles  california 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million an increase of million or approximately over the amount of million 
this increase is due primarily to the higher sales noted above 
the overall gross profit percentage of sales remained about 
selling  general and administration expenses for the year ended december  increased million or to million from million for the year ended december  the full year effect of the geographical expansion noted above accounted for a portion of this increase 
interest expense  net for the year ended december  increased 
million or nearly to million over the year earlier period of million 
this increase reflects the higher borrowings under the line of credit facility incurred in carrying the higher working capital  partially offset by a slightly lower borrowing rate 
the federal  state and foreign income tax provision for the year ended december  was million  a increase of approximately million from last year 
the higher tax is principally due to higher income 
as a result of the foregoing  net income for the year ended december  was million  or 
per share diluted 
this compares with million or 
per share diluted reported for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources the company s financial condition continues to improve 
the net worth as of december  has increased to million 
the company s long term debt including the current position at december  was million  a decrease of 
million from december  the company continues to rely on short term borrowings to finance its working capital 
during the first quarter of each year  century s working capital requirements are at a low point  with short term borrowings of million a significant increase from prior year due principally to the increase in the number of branches and markets served by century 
during the second quarter working capital requirements begin to expand and by july of each year the amount necessary to carry the working capital expands to approximately million 
from july through the remainder of the year  receivable balances are liquidated  releasing substantial amounts of cash that may be used to reduce short term debt 
the operating profits before interest and taxes of the company improved to million from million last year 
the company was thus able to retire nearly 
million of term and subordinated debt which came due during the year and partially fund million on acquisitions of businesses in new markets 
at december  working capital was million  a decrease of approximately 
million from last year 
this decline was partially attributed to the higher debt associated with the acquisitions and the related intangibles costs which in amounted to a net increase of million as compared to a net increase of 
million in when  due to the lower level of acquisition expenditure  funding was internally provided 
it is expected that the company will continue to rely on short term borrowings to fund its future growth which will increase the company s leverage 
however  because the company expects to continue to reinvest its available funds  the amount of debt will grow at a slower rate than the growth in assets 
while the company has continued to generate sufficient cash to liquidate its term and subordinated debt as it becomes due  and make acquisitions necessary for its growth  there is no assurance  given the high degree of financing leverage  the potential for continued growth in this leverage  the seasonality of its principal business  and the strong construction economy that it can continue to do so in the future 
year the year issue exists because many computer systems and applications  including those imbedded in equipment and facilities  use two digit rather than four digit date fields to designate an applicable year 
as a result  the systems and applications may not properly recognize the year or process data which includes it  potentially causing data miscalculations or inaccuracies or operational malfunctions or failures 
each of the company s operating subsidiaries uses systems software acquired from an established software vendor 
in each case the vendor has indicated that the software being supplied is year compliant 
in the case of century  their operating computer environment uses a proxy for a date rather than the actual date thus there is no double zero problem to deal with that would be subject to misinterpretations or miscalculation 
cbe has received a yk compliance certificate from american micro innovations  inc the vendor of their general ledger systems and its supporting modules 
despite the assurance  the company will test these systems during the rd quarter of both century and cbe communicate with their suppliers through edi 
century  however  does not receive its third party data directly into its operating systems but rather it converts such data before it is internally processed  avoiding the opportunity for contamination of their system 
cbe recently tested their edi transmission with several of their largest vendors and found the systems compliant 
century and cbe are continuing to work with their suppliers  however should any supplier or vendor be unable to achieve year compliance by september   the company intends to switch to other suppliers that are able to provide year compliance 
the company does not expect to incur any material additional cost to achieve year compliance 
the company s ability to be completely compliant is  of course  dependant upon the ability of its vendors  suppliers  bankers and other fiduciaries to also be compliant 
in addition  the company can not guarantee that third parties upon whom the company depend for essential services  such as electric utilities  and telephone and other interchange carriers  will convert their critical systems and processes in a timely manner 
failure or delay by any of these parties could disrupt the company s businesses 
the company has established a supplier compliance program to minimize such risks
