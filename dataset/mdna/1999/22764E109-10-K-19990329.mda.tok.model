item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company s business and the homebuilding industry in general are subject to changes in economic conditions  including but not limited to employment levels  interest rates  the availability of credit  and consumer confidence 
the company s success in and in the past several years has been influenced by favorable economic conditions in its principal markets 
employment has been strong  interest rates have been low and relatively stable  low inflation has kept the company s costs predictable 
financing has been and continues to be readily available to crossmann s consumers in the form of fha and va mortgages 
capital has been readily available for expansion  enabling crossmann to take advantage of this strong economic climate 
there can be no assurance that these trends will continue  that employment for the entry level consumer will stay strong  that government sponsored mortgage programs will not be changed or withdrawn  or that interest rates will not change substantially 
nevertheless  crossmann s management is generally optimistic and believes that modest deterioration in these economic conditions might still afford the company a strong housing market 
because the company targets an entry level consumer  price increases in response to strong demand can only be modest 
management strives to increase profits by increasing unit volume 
the focus of crossmann s management is on selling more units in existing markets  thus improving buying power and margins  and on expanding operations to new markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to find attractive opportunities in new cities  nor can there by any assurance that the company will be able to transfer its business strategy to new market areas successfully  or that new markets will offer the opportunities and stability of the company s existing markets 
results of operations during the five year period ended december   the company s sales increased at an average compound annual rate of per year  from million in to million in net income increased at an average compound annual rate of  from million in to million in shareholders equity increased from million as of december  to million as of december  the following table recaps unit growth in the company s markets 
management views volume relative to the total size of each market a significant factor in producing good margins

liquidity and capital resources at december   crossmann had cash and cash equivalents balances of million  of which million was held in escrow for periods of up to days 
the company s primary uses of capital are home construction costs and the purchase and development of land 
real estate inventories were approximately million or of total assets at december  compared to approximately million or of total assets at december  to assure the future availability of developed lots for next year s operations  from time to time in the normal course of business the company contracts to purchase a portion of its developed lots from outside developers

during  expenditures were financed with cash from operations and with borrowings on a million unsecured line of credit with bank one  indiana na and its participant  nbd bank na the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate  but permits portions of the outstanding balance to be committed for fixed periods of time at a rate equal to libor plus through 
in the summer of  bank one and nbd announced plans to merge

the bank will add additional participants in the line of credit upon renewal of the facility on march  the company also has million in senior notes  maturing in with interest payable quarterly at  and million in new notes issued in june of  payable over years at  payable quarterly 
annual principal reductions for this note issue of  begin june  both the note agreements and the bank line of credit require compliance with certain financial and operating covenants and place certain limitations on the company s investments in land and unconsolidated joint ventures 
they also limit payments of cash dividends by the company 
the notes and the modifications to the banks credit agreement are expected to provide adequate liquidity for planned internal growth and capital expenditures 
in the event that the company seeks to accelerate growth through the acquisition of large parcels of land or of other homebuilders  additional capital may be necessary 
the company believes that such capital could be obtained from banks or other financing alternatives  from the issuance of additional shares  or from seller financing  however  there can be no assurances that the company would be able to secure the necessary capital 
the company has financed some of its growth in with equity 
pursuant to the pinehurst transaction  crossmann issued  shares valued at  to the sellers 
inflation and effects of changing prices the company historically has been able to raise sales prices by amounts at least equal to its cost increases and accordingly has not experienced any detrimental effect from inflation 
because the company sells to a price conscious consumer  its ability to raise prices is limited 
management seeks to optimize volume by keeping homes affordable and to optimize margins thorough careful planning 
housing demand  in general  is affected adversely by increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  the company s sales of residential real estate could be adversely affected 
in addition  gross profit and net income can be affected as well because crossmann can assist buyers  subject to certain limitations by fha and va  by paying a portion of a customer s points and closing costs needed to help in securing a mortgage loan 
year system requirements risks presented by the year issue 
crossmann s management believes that the company s core selling and construction operations are largely unautomated and would continue uninterrupted even in the event of year problems 
as for accounting and administration  the company s software is largely not date dependent 
dates are carried for informational purposes and are not generally used in computations 
systems testing 
the manufacturer of the computer on which crossmann s central accounting and management information systems resides has certified that its hardware and operating system software are year compliant 
the company s applications software has been tested in the course of normal maintenance 
the company s programmers have identified those few instances where dates are compared and have initiated corrections to handle the date change properly 
equipment and software peripheral to crossmann s central system are being tested for year compliance 
any replacements or upgrades required are expected to be complete by mid costs 
the cost and timing of upgrades to hardware and software corrections are not deemed to be materially different than normally scheduled upgrades 
contingency plans 
management s contingency plans  which are intended to enable the company to continue to operate normally  include performing some procedures manually  changing suppliers  if necessary  and repairing or obtaining replacement systems 
future trends management views land acquisition and zoning as the greatest challenges to its business in years to come 
the company will continue to seek to maximize the value of each parcel it purchases so that it can continue to serve its core customer
