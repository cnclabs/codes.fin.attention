seasonality the company s business is seasonal  which the company believes is typical of the retail craft and fabric industry 
the company s highest sales and earnings levels historically occur between september and december 
this period includes the back to school  halloween and christmas seasons 
the company has generally operated at a loss during its fourth quarter  the june through august summer period 
see business seasonality 
year to year comparisons of quarterly results and comparable store sales can be affected by a variety of factors  including the timing and duration of holiday selling seasons and the timing of new store openings and promotional markdowns 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary needs for liquidity are to maintain inventory for the company s existing stores and to fund the costs of opening new stores  including capital improvements  initial inventory and pre opening expenses 
in and  the company relied on short term borrowings  internally generated funds and credit made available by suppliers to finance inventories and new store openings 
the company s working capital has increased  in as compared to primarily as a result of the company retaining its net income for the period 
the company maintains a credit facility with a bank 
the credit facility is renewable annually on or before each december and consists of a discretionary unsecured line of credit for direct borrowings and the issuance and refinance of letters of credit 
the line of credit was increased from  to  on august  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate at august  
the company s term loan  initiated during the fiscal year ended august  to finance its new point of sale systems  was paid in april the credit facility requires the company to maintain a compensating balance of  in addition to certain financial covenants which require a minimum defined working capital and tangible net worth  a maximum ratio of debt to tangible net worth and set limits on the payment of dividends 
as of august   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
historically  the amount borrowed has varied based on the company s seasonal requirements  generally reaching a maximum amount outstanding during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the maximum amount borrowed under the line was   and  in  and  respectively 
as of august  and august    and  respectively  was outstanding under the line of credit for direct borrowings and  was outstanding as of august  under the term loan that matured in the company intends to maintain the availability of the line of credit for working capital requirements and in order to be able to take advantage of future opportunities 
the company s point of sale and automated store ordering and receiving systems were completely installed in all stores as of july and march  respectively  and are now fully operational 
the company purchases merchandise directly from manufacturers in the far east 
these purchases are payable in united states dollars and are either by direct payment or supported by letters of credit 
the results of operations of the company have not been significantly affected by foreign currency fluctuation 
at august   the company had outstanding letters of credit in the approximate amount of  during  and  the company had net cash used in provided by operating activities of   and  respectively  and used   and  respectively for purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by operating activities decreased in primarily as a result of the increase in merchandise inventories 
the company expects to open three stores and close two existing stores during costs associated with opening of new stores  including capital expenditures  inventory and pre opening expenses have approximated  per store 
these costs will be financed primarily from cash provided by operating activities  credit made available by suppliers to finance inventories and  if necessary  from the company s bank line of credit 
however  the company will redeploy assets of stores being closed to the new stores as opportunities evolve in order to curtail the costs of opening stores 
year to conduct its business efficiently  the company relies on several critical information technology it systems for functions including point of sale operations  inventory control  financial and accounting management  communications  purchasing  records retention  and general administrative procedures 
beginning in  the company began an internal review of its it systems to ensure their viability in light of the highly publicized year problem 
the company has also continued to assess other non it systems such as security and electrical to identify potential year issues that may arise from embedded chip technology 
because the company s use of internal systems that include such technology is limited  management does not expect its non it systems to pose a material year issue 
concurrently  management has been undertaking a general reevaluation of the company s it systems in its effort to enhance efficiency and increase profitability in a highly competitive marketplace 
in several cases  this modernization program has allowed management to address year compliance issues by entirely replacing certain obsolete technology with new systems that are year compliant 
among the systems whose modernization is completed or underway are those controlling inventory  purchasing  point of sale data and central administration 
as part of this review  management has also communicated with its most important suppliers and other vendors to ensure their year compliance 
the company is cooperating with these vendors to upgrade certain software and maintain year compliance both internally and externally 
the company believes it has successfully achieved year compliance with all of its significant computer hardware and software 
because the company has focused its attention primarily on updating its systems  it has commenced the development of a contingency plan in the event of any interruption of key internal or external services 
management expects to complete such a plan prior to january in particular  the company s plan will seek to establish alternatives in the event of any disturbance in external telecommunications  electric power  financial or transportation networks 
although at this time the company cannot estimate the impact of an interruption in any of these services  it is possible that a sustained disruption would materially affect the company s operations and financial results 
since most of the company s year compliance expenses have arisen in the context of a general it modernization  these remediation costs did not rise to a material level
