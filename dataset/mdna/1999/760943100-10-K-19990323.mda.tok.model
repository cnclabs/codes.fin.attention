item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview res care  inc the company receives revenues primarily from the delivery of residential  training  education and support services to populations with special needs 
the company has three reportable operating segments i disabilities services  ii job corps program  and iii other youth services programs 
management s discussion and analysis of each segment follows 
further information regarding each of these segments  including the required disclosure of certain segment financial information  is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements of the company 
such disclosures are incorporated herein by reference and should be read in conjunction with this item 
revenues for the company s disabilities services operations are derived primarily from state government agencies under the medicaid reimbursement system and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid system 
reimbursement methods vary by state and are typically based on a flat rate or cost based reimbursement system on a per person  per diem basis 
generally  rates are adjusted annually based primarily upon historical costs experienced by the company and by other service providers  and on inflation 
at facilities and programs where it is the provider of record  the company is directly reimbursed under state medicaid programs for services it provides and such reimbursement is affected by occupancy levels 
at most facilities and programs that the company operates pursuant to management contracts  the management fee is negotiated based upon the reimbursement amount expected to be earned by the provider of record  which is affected by occupancy levels 
under certain management contracts  the company is paid a fixed fee regardless of occupancy levels 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s revenue recognition policies with respect to medicaid contracts 
as of february   the company operated vocational training programs under the federal job corps program administered by the united states department of labor dol 
under the job corps program  the company is reimbursed for direct costs related to job corps center operations and allowable indirect costs for general and administrative expenses  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a fixed percentage of facility and program expenses 
all of such amounts are reflected as revenue  and all such direct costs are reflected as facility and program expenses 
final determination of amounts due under job corps contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol  and renewals and extension of job corps contracts are based in part on performance reviews 
in  the company began operating other programs for at risk and troubled youths through its youthtrack  inc youthtrack and alternative youth services ays subsidiaries 
most of the youth services programs are funded directly by federal  state and local government agencies including school systems 
under these contracts  the company is typically reimbursed based on fixed contract amounts  flat rates or cost based rates 
in and  the effect of youthtrack management s ownership interest is reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income as a minority interest 
on january   the company acquired through merger  the twenty percent minority interest in youthtrack formerly held by members of its founding management 
expenses incurred under federal  state and local government agency contracts for disabilities services  job corps and other youth services  as well as management contracts with providers of record for such agencies  are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
any resulting adjustments would be recorded as contractual adjustments to revenues in the period in which the adjustment is made 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s revenues and net income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  in part because annual medicaid rate adjustments may be announced by the various states inconsistently and are usually retroactive to the beginning of the particular state s fiscal reporting period 
the company expects that future adjustments in reimbursement rates in most states will consist primarily of cost of living adjustments 
however  in some cases states have revised their rate setting methodologies  which has resulted in rate decreases as well as rate increases 
current initiatives at the federal or state level may materially change the medicaid system as it now exists 
retroactively calculated contractual adjustments are estimated and accrued in the periods the related services are rendered and recorded as adjustments in future periods as final adjustments are received 
because the cumulative effect of rate adjustments may differ from previously estimated amounts  net income as a percentage of net revenues for a period in which an adjustment occurs may not be indicative of expected results in succeeding periods 
revenues in the future may be affected by changes in rate setting structures  methodologies or interpretations that may be proposed or are under consideration in states where the company operates 
also  some states have considered initiating managed care plans for persons currently in medicaid programs 
at this time  the company cannot determine the impact of such changes  or the effect of various federal initiatives that have been proposed

the change in the effective tax rate is due primarily to premier being taxed as a partnership prior to the increase in income tax expense is attributable to a higher level of operating income as described above and the restatement of financial statements for the premier pooling of interests completed january  liquidity and capital resources the company s need for capital is attributable primarily to the company s plans to expand through acquisitions and the development of new facilities and programs  and to have sufficient working capital for general corporate purposes 
since most of the company s facilities and programs are operating at or near capacity  and budgetary pressures and other forces are expected to limit increases in reimbursement rates received by the company  the company s ability to continue to grow at its current rate is directly dependent upon such acquisitions and development 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for  and million for the decrease in from was due primarily to a growth in accounts receivable as well as declines in the growth of current liabilities 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily related to the increased number of acquisitions made during the increase in from was due primarily to an increase in income from continuing operations  trade payables and accrued expenses  offset by an increase in accounts receivable

as of december   the company had million available on its line of credit and million in cash and cash equivalents 
outstanding at that date were irrevocable standby letters of credit in the principal amount of million issued in connection with workers compensation insurance and certain facility leases 
net days revenue in accounts receivable for the company was days at december   compared to days at december  and days at december  accounts receivable at december   increased to million  compared to million at december   and million at december  growth in these amounts has been primarily related to delays in payment from certain state medicaid programs and the integration of acquired operations 
the company has historically sought to provide its services in leased premises  especially in the case of larger facilities 
however  in response to changes in certain reimbursement methodologies primarily related to its expansion of services provided to consumers in community based settings  the company has increased its real estate purchases  particularity residential homes 
also  acquisitions may involve the purchase of real estate 
the company has historically satisfied its working capital requirements  capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments from its operating cash flow and utilization of its credit facility 
cash requirements for the acquisition of new business operations have generally been funded through a combination of cash generated from operating activities  utilization of the company s revolving credit facility and the issuance of long term obligations and common stock 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and availability under its expanded credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet its working capital  planned capital expenditure  business acquisition and scheduled debt repayment requirements over the next twelve months 
year issue assessment and remediation plans in response to the year issue  the company established a task force to address year issues in the following specific areas i information systems  ii medical equipment and physical facilities  and iii third party relationships 
information systems the company has completed its initial assessment of the capability of its information systems to meet year processing requirements 
based on this assessment  the company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace certain portions of its information systems 
the company will be focusing a significant portion of its internal remediation efforts on the aspects of information systems that affect revenue generation 
currently  the company utilizes certain purchased software to monitor accounts receivable and generate a portion of its billings to third party payors 
the company also utilizes software supplied by certain states or their contracted third party vendors to electronically generate its billings to third party payors 
it is the intention of management to upgrade its accounts receivable and billing system beginning in the second quarter of with an estimated completion date in the third quarter of in addition to this upgrade  management is in the process of acquiring a year compliant software program which will be utilized to generate substantially all invoices electronically and monitor accounts receivable 
the estimated completion date for installation and testing of this billing system is october  during  the company completed the requisite upgrades to its general ledger and payroll systems in order for those systems to be compliant 
substantially all desktop computers  network devices and related software have been tested and those found to be noncompliant have been replaced 
the company plans to rely principally on its own staff resources for year remediation of its information systems medical equipment and physical facilities the effort to identify potential year problems within the company s medical equipment and physical facilities is ongoing 
when complete  vendors  manufacturers and others with whom the company conducts business  and where the interruption of such business could have a material adverse effect on the company  will be contacted  and cost effective efforts made to remediate or minimize possible problems 
upon completion of this assessment  remediation plans will be developed 
the company believes that it will be able to complete its assessment of material adverse risk associated with year problems in its medical equipment and physical facilities sufficiently in advance of january   to effect remedial measures where such measures are possible and cost effective 
the current target date for completing the assessment is june  and the target date for completing any remedial measures is september  the company presently believes that with appropriate and timely modifications and replacements  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
the company plans to rely principally on its own staff resources for year remediation of medical equipment and physical facilities 
third party relationships the company continues to assess the year compliance capability of its significant third party payors and vendors 
because a substantial portion of the company s revenues are derived from medicaid programs  to the extent that certain federal and state governmental agencies are noncompliant  the company s cash flows  liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the health care financing administration has issued guidance requiring state medicaid agencies to certify that the state s medicaid management information systems  and mission critical interfaces  are year compliant by march  the company has received representations from its third party payroll processor  as well as its significant relationship banks  that their systems will be year compliant 
there can be no assurance that the systems of these third parties will be compliant and will not have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
an inventory of significant third party payors and vendors is in process  and questionnaires are being mailed during march requesting representations regarding their year readiness 
the company anticipates completing its assessment and any necessary actions by the end of the third quarter of contingency plans the company has not established a formal contingency plan to address failures in the company s year assessment and remediation plan 
the task force has been directed to complete plans for the three areas described in this section  as well as other less significant areas within the company  and to submit the plans to the executive management team by june  contingency plans will be developed for any area of the year remediation effort where such effort is incomplete  the consequence of a possible year problem is materially adverse and a viable contingency plan is possible and economically reasonable 
substantially all critical financial information systems currently in place  including the internal accounts receivable and billing system described above  are being remediated to be year compliant in the event of an unanticipated delay in the implementation of the company s new systems 
as the company contacts third party reimbursement sources  it is developing contingency plans to receive temporary reimbursement in the event of system failures by these entities 
the company s contingency plans will also cover failures by suppliers and vendors 
further  each of the company s operating units has plans to handle emergency situations such as a loss of utility services or supplies 
year risk the company believes the greatest risk posed by the year issue is the timely reimbursement by third party governmental payors 
management believes that delays in the collection of accounts receivable potentially represent significant operational risk with respect to the year issue 
should cash collections on accounts receivable from third party payors be significantly delayed  the company s working capital could be adversely affected 
management continues to evaluate its financing needs  including needs arising from year problems 
while the company could utilize its existing revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs  the company could also be forced to seek additional external financing 
use of funding sources for working capital could also adversely affect plans to expand the company s business through internally generated growth or acquisitions 
no assurance can be given that additional financing to support working capital  growth or acquisitions would be available to the company 
cost of plan the total cost of modifying and replacing information systems is currently expected to range from million to million 
certain of these costs generally attributable to replacement equipment will be capitalized and amortized over a three to five year period 
other costs to remediate the year issue will be expensed as incurred 
at december   the company had incurred approximately million of these costs 
the total cost of modifying and replacing medical equipment and physical facility components is not expected to be material 
the company believes that the total costs associated with replacing and modifying its current systems will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or liquidity 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company believes that it will substantially complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates using information currently available 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
effect of recently issued accounting standards in april  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
the sop requires that all costs of start up activities and organization costs be expensed as incurred 
the sop is effective for the company s year ending december  initial application of the sop will result in the write off of any unamortized start up and organization costs  the impact of which will be reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
it is the intention of management of the company to adopt the provisions of the sop effective january  as of december   deferred start up and organization costs of million net of accumulated amortization of million were included in other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
certain risk factors the company s growth in revenues and earnings per share has been directly related to a considerable increase in the number of individuals served in each of its operating segments 
this growth is largely dependent upon development driven activities  including the acquisitions of other businesses or facilities or of management contract rights to operate facilities  the award of contracts to open new facilities or start new operations or to assume management of facilities previously operated by governmental agencies or not for profit organizations and the extension or renewal of contracts previously awarded to the company 
the company often makes forward looking statements regarding its development activities 
changes in the company s future revenues depend significantly upon the success of these development activities  and in particular on the company s ability to obtain additional contracts to provide services to the special needs populations it serves  whether through acquisitions  awards in response to requests for proposals for new facilities or programs or for facilities being privatized by governmental agencies  or other development activities 
future revenues also depend on the company s ability to maintain and renew its existing services contracts and its existing leases 
the company actively seeks acquisitions of other companies  facilities and assets as a means of increasing the number of consumers served 
changes in the market for such acquisition prospects  including increasing competition for and increasing pricing of such acquisition prospects  could also adversely affect the timing and or viability of future development activities 
revenues of the company s disabilities services segment are highly dependent on reimbursement under federal and state medicaid programs 
generally  each state has its own medicaid reimbursement regulations and formula 
the company s revenues and operating profitability are dependent upon its ability to maintain its existing reimbursement levels and to obtain periodic increases in reimbursement rates 
changes in the manner in which medicaid reimbursement rates are established or reviewed in one or more of the states in which the company conducts its operations could adversely affect revenues and profitability 
other changes in the manner in which federal and state reimbursement programs are operated  and in the manner in which billings costs are reviewed and audited  could also affect revenues and operating profitability 
the company s cost structure and ultimate operating profitability are significantly dependent on its labor costs and the availability and utilization of its labor force and thus may be affected by a variety of factors  including local competitive forces  changes in minimum wages or other direct personnel costs  the company s effectiveness in managing its direct service staff  and changes in consumer services models  such as the trends toward supported living and managed care 
additionally  the company s continued expansion of its existing operations  and its ability to expand its provision of services to other populations utilizing the company s core competencies are dependent upon continuation of trends toward downsizing  privatization and consolidation and the company s ability to tailor its services to meet the specific needs of these different populations 
the success in operating in a changing environment is subject to a variety of political  economic  social and legal pressures  including desires of governmental agencies to reduce costs and increase levels of services  federal  state and local budgetary constraints and actions brought by advocacy groups and the courts to change existing service delivery systems 
material changes resulting from these trends and pressures could adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement of the company s services and its operating flexibility  and ultimately its revenues and profitability 
from time to time  the company or a provider with which the company has a management agreement  is a party to legal and or administrative proceedings involving state program administrators and others that  in the event of unfavorable outcomes  may adversely affect revenues and period to period comparisons 
in addition  the company is a party to various legal proceedings encountered in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes that many of such legal proceedings are without merit 
further  such claims may be covered by insurance 
the company does not believe the results of such proceedings or litigation will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations or liquidity
