graco s sales outside the americas accounted for percent of total sales  and were down slightly from consolidated backlog at december   was million compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the decline in backlog was primarily due to graco s strategic decision to restructure its automotive business  which resulted in fewer large orders

gross margins of percent were down from gross margins of percent 
this was a result of several factors  including the mix of products sold  material cost increases and exchange rates  partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies

foreign currency effects foreign currency translations negatively impacted earnings before income taxes by million when compared to  and decreased earnings before income taxes by million when compared to the reduced profits in both years were due to a strong us dollar  versus other foreign currencies 
since approximately percent of the company s sales and percent of its product costs are in currencies other than the us dollar  a strong us dollar reduces the company s profits 
gains and losses attributable to translating the financial statements of all non us subsidiaries and the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts used to hedge these exposures  which are non speculative  are reported in other expense income 
other expense income in  interest expense  net of interest income  increased to million due to the borrowing incurred to fund the repurchase of million shares of graco inc common stock from the trust under the will of clarissa l 
gray 
other expense  net of other income  was million in compared to other expense in of million and other income in of million 
other expense income includes  among other things  the foreign currency translation gains and losses discussed above  a million gain from the sale of real estate in  a million favorable settlement of a legal dispute in and a million favorable settlement of a lawsuit in income taxes the company s net effective tax rate of percent in is one percentage point lower than the us federal tax rate of percent 
the increase from the percent rate in is due primarily to foreign earnings being taxed at higher effective rates and the full utilization in of tax benefits associated with previously reserved foreign subsidiary net operating losses 
the effective tax rate of percent in was lower than the rate of percent principally due to foreign earnings being taxed at lower effective rates than the us rate as foreign subsidiary earnings permitted the recognition of previously reserved deferred tax benefits and previous tax filings were validated 
reconciliations of the us federal tax rate to the effective rates for  and are included in note d to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting changes the one month reporting lag of the company s european subsidiaries was eliminated in and resulted in europe s december net earnings being recorded as an adjustment to equity 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as discussed under foreign currency effects  graco sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  the company is subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements 
graco uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce risks associated with foreign currency net balance sheet positions 
these contracts typically have maturities of days or less  and gains or losses from changes in market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying balance sheet items 
at december   the foreign currencies to which the company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the canadian dollar  spanish peseta  japanese yen  italian lira  british pound  german mark  korean won  belgian franc and french franc 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
to evaluate its currency exchange rate risks on its foreign exchange contracts  the company uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact on earnings of hypothetical changes in the value of foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
at december   due to the short term nature of the company s hedging instruments  reasonably likely fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the near term would not materially affect graco s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows 
the company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in earnings due to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
at december   a basis point increase or decrease in the market interest rates  principally libor  would not materially increase or decrease interest expense or cash flows

year the year issue is the result of computer programs that were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could cause potential failure or miscalculation in date sensitive software that recognizes as rather than the company is continuing its program  begun in  to ensure that all information technology systems and non information technology non it systems will be year compliant 
the assessment phase of the year project has been completed 
it was determined that the company needed to modify or upgrade most of its mainframe applications  operating systems  network hardware and software and desktop hardware and software 
in addition  many non it systems required upgrading or replacement in order to ensure proper functioning beyond the year the mainframe modification phase involving the conversion of core business applications was completed in july and the operating systems upgrades were completed in november the network and desktop upgrades involving the replacement of certain hardware and software is scheduled to be completed by july further testing of all mainframe applications and databases is scheduled to continue through july approximately non it applications were identified at the company with approximately percent being year compliant as of december non it applications are primarily microprocessors and other electronic controls embedded in non computer equipment used by the company 
teams have been assembled to ensure the successful conversion of the remaining systems 
these conversions will continue into the company has incurred costs totaling million  including million in  and estimates a total of an additional million to be spent in to resolve year issues 
these costs are charged to expense as incurred and include software license fees and cost of persons assigned to the project 
incremental costs associated with year compliance are not anticipated to result in significant increases in future operating expenses and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
existing resources are being redeployed and other projects are being delayed to accommodate year related projects 
these delays are not expected to have a material adverse impact on future results of operations or financial condition 
business continuation plans for critical business processes and applications are being developed 
these plans include adequate staffing on site during the year date change to quickly repair any errant applications 
in addition  in the event of any problems the company will follow its current computer outage business continuation plans until such problems are corrected 
the company is having discussions with  and has sent questionnaires to  its suppliers to assess their year readiness 
information will continue to be gathered from key suppliers throughout the company will identify alternative suppliers for those suppliers unable to supply materials due to year issues 
the company has very few customers whose loss of business would be material to the company 
it is not aware of any year issues with these customers that would have a material adverse impact on the company s results 
management believes that sufficient resources have been allocated and project plans are in place to avoid any adverse material impact on operations or operating results 
however  there can be no guarantee that the company s systems will be converted in a timely fashion and year problems will not have an adverse effect on the company 
the year efforts of third parties are not within the company s control and their failure to respond to year issues successfully could result in business disruption and increased operating costs to the company 
at the present time  it is not possible to determine whether any such events are likely to occur  or to quantify any potential impact they may have on the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading safe harbor cautionary statement on the next page

the company has harmonized its price lists in the affected countries and has updated its system to allow for invoicing in the euro 
although difficult to predict  any competitive implications on the company s pricing and marketing strategies and any impact on existing financial instruments resulting from the euro implementation are not expected to be material to the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations

despite these conditions  we are determined to improve our earnings per share in graco has changed a number of business processes in recent years that have improved its effectiveness in the markets it serves  and have increased the company s operating margins and net profits 
these efforts will continue to favorably impact margins and profits in in  we restructured our automotive operations  and anticipate some short term volatility in these sales  but improved profitability as we transition to serving the automotive industry in a new and improved manner 
we anticipate that the weakness of the us dollar relative to other major currencies will have a slightly positive impact on operating margins in safe harbor cautionary statement the information in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements about the company s expectations of the future  which are subject to certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expectations
