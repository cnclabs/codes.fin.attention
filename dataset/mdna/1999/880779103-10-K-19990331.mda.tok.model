contingencies and uncertainties internal revenue service the company s federal income tax returns for the years through are currently being audited by the irs 
in december  the company received an examination report from the irs proposing a large tax deficiency 
the examination report raised many issues 
among these issues are substantiation for certain tax deductions and whether the company was able to use certain net operating loss carryovers nols to offset taxable income 
in april  the company filed an administrative appeal to the examination report 
the irs is currently reviewing information the company provided to it 
the final outcome of this audit is subject to the resolution of complicated legal and factual issues 
given the number and complexity of the legal and administrative proceedings involved  this audit could continue for several more years 
if the irs prevails on all the issues raised  the amount of the tax the company would have to pay would be approximately million plus penalties of approximately million and interest through december  of approximately million 
the penalties claimed by the irs are between and of the amount of the tax deficiency assessed against the company 
interest on the amount of tax deficiency and penalties assessed against the company is currently accruing at a rate of per annum 
if the company is required to pay a significant portion of the tax deficiency claimed by the irs  it may not have or be able to obtain the money necessary to pay the tax deficiency and continue in business 
the company believes that it is able to provide adequate documentation for a large part of the tax deductions the irs has disallowed 
in addition  the irs has recently advised the company that it is no longer challenging the company s right to use the nols in question 
as a result  the company does not believe that the outcome of the audit will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  the company may lose or have to use some of its nols as a result of the audit 
in addition  there is also a possibility that the company will have to pay some amount of tax  penalties and interest to the irs to resolve this matter 
the final outcome of the audit cannot be determined or estimated at this time 
accordingly  the company does not have any additional reserves for amounts which might be due as a result of the audit because the loss ranges from zero to million plus interest and penalties 
securities and exchange commission in march  the securities and exchange commission began a private investigation of the company and certain of its present and former officers and directors

to date  this investigation has focused primarily on the accounting treatment and the reporting in filings with the sec of various transactions which took place in the late s and the early s 
the company is cooperating with the sec in its investigation 
the sec has advised the company that it may bring an administrative proceeding against the company and certain of its present and former officers and directors 
the company understands that if the sec brings such proceedings  the sec would seek an order requiring the company to cease and desist violating the federal securities laws  but would not impose monetary penalties on the company 
such an order would be based on claims relating to the accounting treatment and the reporting in the company s financial statements for the years ended december  and  and its proxy statement for the fiscal year 
the company is currently in negotiations with the sec to resolve this matter 
it is not possible at this time for us to determine the outcome of this investigation 
year issue the year yk problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
thus  the year is represented by the number in many legacy software applications 
consequently  on january  the year will jump back to for many non yk compliant applications 
to systems that are non yk compliant  the time will seem to have reverted back years 
accordingly  when computing basic lengths of time  computer programs  certain building infrastructure components including elevators  alarm systems  telephone networks  sprinkler systems  security access systems and certain hvac systems and any additional time sensitive software that are non yk compliant may recognize a date using as the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations which could cause personal injury  property damage  disruption of operations  and or delays in payments from terex s customers  any or all of which could materially adversely affect terex s business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the company has conducted a company wide assessment of its computer systems  products and operations infrastructure to identify computer hardware  software  and process control systems that are not yk compliant 
the company believes that it has identified those business critical computer systems which are not presently yk compliant  and has instituted a plan to replace  upgrade or modify most of these systems by mid however  the company acquired seven new companies during  all but one of which is located in europe 
the business critical systems of certain of the newly acquired companies  including o k mining  were not yk compliant at the time of acquisition 
the company has instituted a plan to replace  upgrade or modify the systems at these acquired companies and expects to be completed by the end of  however  no assurance can be given that the replacement  upgrade or modification of the systems at these companies will be timely completed 
the total cost associated with required modifications to become yk compliant is not expected to exceed million  and a significant portion of these costs were planned upgrades to the current financial and operating systems 
the company has also initiated communications with third parties whose computer systems functionality could impact terex 
these communications will facilitate coordination of yk solutions and will permit the company to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to failures of third parties to address their own yk issues 
to date  the company has not identified any significant issues with respect to third parties 
the failure to correct a material yk problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of yk failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition  and as such  has not yet established a contingency plan to handle the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
the company s yk project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the yk problem and  in particular  about the yk compliance and readiness of its material suppliers and customers 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of its yk project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
euro on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency the euro 
the euro now trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
beginning in january  new euro denominated bills and coins will be issued  and legacy currencies will be withdrawn from circulation 
terex s operating subsidiaries affected by the euro conversion are assessing the systems and business issues raised by the euro currency conversion 
these issues include  among others  the need to adapt computer and other business systems and equipment to accommodate euro denominated transactions and the competitive impact of cross border price transparency  which may make it more difficult for businesses to charge different prices for the same products on a country by country basis particularly once the euro currency is issued in the company anticipates that the euro conversion will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
other the company is subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including product liability claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations and guarantees 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any cost to the company 
however  the company does not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company 
when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of the company s liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
the company generates hazardous and nonhazardous wastes in the normal course of its manufacturing operations 
as a result  the company is subject to a wide range of federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects and also require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations also impose liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances 
compliance with these laws and regulations has  and will continue to require  the company to make expenditures 
the company does not expect that these expenditures will have a material adverse effect on its business or profitability 
foreign currencies and interest rate risk the company s products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  revenues of the company are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which the company does business are the pound sterling  the french franc  the german mark and the italian lira 
the company may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
such foreign currency contracts have not historically been material in amount 
because certain of the company s obligations  including indebtedness under the company s bank credit facility will bear interest at floating rates  an increase in interest rates could adversely affect  among other things  the results of operations of the company 
the company has entered into interest protection arrangements with respect to approximately million of the principal amount of its indebtedness under its bank credit facility fixing interest at various rates between and
