sales decreased in to million from million in the decrease was due to the continued softening of the domestic digitizer business  the consolidation among domestic oem customers and lower software sales as compared to this was partially offset by an increase in international digitizer sales 
in the fourth quarter  the company began shipping a computed radiography cr system for the medical market  the acr no customers accounted for more than of the company s sales in either or the company typically does not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from its customers  and a substantial portion of the company s backlog is scheduled for delivery within days or less 
customers may cancel orders and change volume levels or delivery times without penalty 
sales and operating results therefore depend on the volume and timing of the backlog as well as bookings received during the period 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are fixed  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts and product development programs 
if sales do not meet the company s expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust operating expenses sufficiently or quickly enough to compensate for such a shortfall

the development of a new product will require additional research and development resources and therefore the research and development expenses will increase when the next new product is identified

provision benefit for income taxes 
the company recorded a current provision for income taxes of million in in  the company recorded a current provision for income taxes of million  which was partially offset by a deferred benefit of  resulting in a net provision of million for the year 
the recognition of deferred tax assets was based on the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that this portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company has provided a partial valuation allowance against the balance of the deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its operations activities primarily from net cash provided by operations 
in  one time payments for expenses related to the acquisition of compurad resulted in a reduction in cash reserves of million compared to positive cash operating results of  in and  in the company had cash expenditures of million related to the purchase of a software product  hlimage in in and  the company executed a stock repurchase plan resulting in cash expenditures of million and  in and  respectively  for the purchase of its stock

the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds to be generated by operations will satisfy the company s cash flow requirements through at least thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s projected requirements  the company may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain bank or other credit facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell such securities or obtain such credit facilities on acceptable terms in the future  if at all 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders 
impact of the year the rapid approach of year presents significant issues for many computer systems  since much of the software in use today may not accurately process data beyond the company has recently implemented new information systems and accordingly does not anticipate any internal year issue from its own information systems  databases or programs 
however  the company could be adversely impacted by year issues faced by major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors and financial service organizations with which the company interacts 
the company is currently taking steps to address the impact  if any  of the year issue on the operations of the company 
there can be no assurances that such a review will detect all potential failures of the company s and or third party s computer systems 
a significant failure of the company s or a third party s computer system could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain software products currently installed at customer sites will require upgrade or other remediation to become year compliant 
the company believes that it is not legally responsible for costs incurred by its customers to achieve their year compliance 
however  the company is taking steps to identify affected customers  raise customer awareness related to noncompliance of the company s older products  and assist the customer base to assess their risks 
the company may see increasing customer satisfaction costs related to these actions over the next few years 
the potential impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations is not known at this time 
costs to address the company s year issues 
although the company will continue to prioritize resources to address year issues  those resources are allocated within the normal software development and infrastructure and facilities improvement processes of the company 
subsequently  no complete estimate of the expected total cost of this effort can be made at this time 
the costs related to yk have been immaterial to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lumisys has an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
lumisys attempts to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
from time to time  lumisys makes certain capital equipment or other purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  lumisys cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
lumisys attempts to limit these exposures through operational strategies and generally has not hedged currency exposures
