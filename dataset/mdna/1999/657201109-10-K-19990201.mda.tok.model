other relationships 
the company holds licenses and other rights to additional technologies that the company is researching and or developing jointly with various research institutions 
in addition  the company is in various stages of discussions with third parties  including multinational pharmaceutical companies  regarding various business arrangements  including acquisitions  licensing  research and development  distribution  marketing  joint venture and other business agreements 
there are no assurances that the company will successfully negotiate and sign any such agreement or that  if executed  the financial terms of any such agreement will be significant 
competition competition in the vaccine industry is intense 
the company faces competition from many companies  including a number of large companies and specialized firms in the united states and abroad that are engaged in the development and production of vaccines  and major universities and research institutions 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  more extensive experience in conducting clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products  greater operating experience  larger research and development and marketing staffs  and greater production capabilities than those of the company 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors in the vaccine industry are product quality  measured by the safety and efficacy of a vaccine product  ease of administration represented by combination vaccines and vaccines that are stable in liquid form and price 
see marketing of vaccines 
the company believes that its principal competitors in the united states are wyeth lederle a subsidiary of american home products  merck co  smithkline beecham plc  and pasteur merieux connaught  most of which are active in the development of acellular pertussis  combination and conjugate vaccines 
for example  over the past three years  three companies announced that they had received fda approval for their dtap vaccine for infants and children 
in addition  to the extent that these competitors are successful in developing and marketing combination vaccines that include dtap vaccines  these combination vaccines may gain market share at the expense of stand alone dtap vaccines  including certiva trademark 
one of these competitors has announced that the fda licensed a vaccine that combines by reconstitution that company s hib vaccine with its dtap vaccine for administration at months of age and that it continues to seek fda approval for administration of this combination vaccine at two  four and six months of age 
another competitor has reported that it is in clinical trials for a dtap hib combination vaccine 
in addition  several competing dtap vaccines and certain combination vaccines incorporating dtap  ipv and or hib vaccines have been licensed for sale outside of the united states 
see risk factors competition and technological change 
patents and proprietary information the company actively pursues a strategy of seeking patent protection for valuable patentable subject matter 
the company believes that patent and trade secret protection is an important element of its business and that its success will depend in part on its ability to obtain strong patents  to maintain trade secret protection  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
the company holds as assignee and licensee a number of patents and patent applications 
see business relationships and risk factors patent protection and proprietary information 
the company also relies upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain its competitive position 
disclosure and use of the company s know how is generally controlled under agreements with the parties involved 
in addition  the company has confidentiality agreements with its employees  consultants and officers 
there can be no assurance that disclosure of the company s trade secrets will not occur  or that others will not independently develop and patent equivalent technology 
government regulation the company and its products are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda in the united states and by comparable authorities in other countries 
these national agencies and other federal  state  and local authorities regulate  among other things  the preclinical and clinical testing  safety  effectiveness  approval  manufacturing  labeling  advertising  promotion  export  and marketing of the company s products 
in the united states  fda regulates human vaccine products under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the public health service act  and other laws 
the steps required before a human vaccine product may be approved for marketing in the united states generally include i preclinical laboratory and animal testing  ii submission to the fda of an ind for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  iii human clinical trials and other studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the product  iv the submission to the fda of license applications  v fda review of the license applications  and vi satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices gmp 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
see risk factors government regulation  regulatory approvals 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product  as well as animal studies to assess its safety  immunogenicity  and potential efficacy 
the results of preclinical tests  together with the manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 
an ind will automatically become effective days after receipt by the fda  unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions 
if it does  the fda s concerns and questions must be resolved before clinical trials can proceed 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new vaccine to healthy volunteers or to patients  under the supervision of a qualified investigator 
clinical trials are conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used to monitor efficacy and safety 
each clinical study must be reviewed by an independent institutional review board irb  and the irb must approve the study before it begins 
in its review  the irb will consider  among other things  ethical factors and the safety of human subjects 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the vaccine into human subjects usually healthy volunteers  the vaccine is tested for safety adverse effects  optimal dosage  and its ability to induce an immune response immunogenicity 
phase ii involves studies in limited target patient populations to further evaluate immunogenicity and optimal dosage  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
phase iii clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy or some measure thereof and to further test for safety within an expanded target patient population  usually at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
there can be no assurance that phase i  phase ii or phase iii testing of any of the company s products will be successfully completed within any specific time period  if at all  or  that if they are completed  that the results of the trial will be sufficient to serve as the basis of a license application submission to the fda 
furthermore  fda may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
see risk factors uncertainties related to clinical trials 
the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  together with detailed information on the manufacture and composition of a product  are submitted to the fda in the form of both a product license application pla and establishment license application ela requesting approval to market the product 
pursuant to the food and drug modernization act  fda has proposed to combine the pla and ela into a biologics license application bla 
until that proposal is made final  companies will continue to submit a pla ela 
the pla describes the results of clinical and pre clinical studies  the ela describes the facilities  equipment  and personnel involved in the manufacturing process 
the fda may deny a bla or pla ela if applicable regulatory criteria are not met  require additional testing or information  and or require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product 
before approving a bla or pla ela  fda will inspect the facilities at which a product is manufactured  and will not approve the product unless gmp compliance is satisfactory 
both before and after approval is obtained  violations of regulatory requirements  including the preclinical and clinical testing process  the bla or pla ela review process  or thereafter including after approval  may result in various adverse consequences  including the fda s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  withdrawal of an approved product from the market  seizure  injunction  and or the imposition of criminal penalties against the license holder 
for example  each holder of an ind or fda license is required to report certain adverse reactions to the fda  and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products 
also  quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to gmp regulations after approval  and the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with gmp 
accordingly  manufacturers must continue to expend time  moneys  and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain gmp compliance 
in addition  discovery of problems may result in restrictions on a product  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
also  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the company s products under development 
the company will also be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and sales of its products 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
requirements similar to fda s are also in effect in the european union and other foreign countries where the company has applied or may apply for regulatory approval for clinical studies and or marketing of its vaccines 
the company s research and operations also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health agency  the environmental protection agency  the department of agriculture  and the department of transportation 
the company also is subject to regulation under the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and other regulatory statutes  and may in the future be subject to other federal  state  local or foreign regulations 
the company s compliance with laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment  does not have a material effect on the ongoing operations of the company 
the company has not made any material expenditures for environmental control facilities  nor does it anticipate any such expenditures during the current fiscal year 
raw materials laboratory supplies utilized in the company s research  development generally are available from several commercial suppliers under standard terms and conditions 
most raw materials necessary for process development  scale up and commercial manufacturing are generally available from multiple commercial suppliers 
however  certain processes require raw materials from sole sources or materials that are difficult for suppliers to produce and certify to the company s specifications 
in addition  the company may experience temporary or permanent shortages of critical raw materials necessary for continued production of its vaccines 
accordingly  given the specific nature of  and critical need for  certain raw materials  there is a risk that material shortages could delay production efforts  adversely impact production costs and yields  and even necessitate the use of substitute materials 
any of these events could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
see also risk factors dependence on suppliers 
product liability the testing and marketing of vaccines entail an inherent risk of product liability attributable to unwanted and potentially serious health effects 
the extent of this risk was sufficiently great in the united states that  by the mid s  many manufacturers ceased production of pediatric vaccines because of liability exposure 
in response to these withdrawals from the vaccine market  congress enacted the ncvi act to ensure the availability of government mandated pediatric vaccines by addressing the liability of manufacturers for immunization related injuries 
among other things  the ncvi act created a trust fund  supported by an excise tax on each dose of vaccine sold  to compensate eligible injured parties 
compensation awards are statutorily established and are generally limited to actual and projected unreimbursed medical  rehabilitative and custodial expenses  lost earnings  and pain and suffering  together with reasonable attorneys fees 
injured parties are not allowed to bring a lawsuit against the manufacturer unless they have filed a claim with the program  received a final determination and rejected it in favor of litigation 
the ncvi act may not  however  protect vaccine manufacturers against liability if the conditions of the ncvi act are not satisfied  or against suits by family members of an injured party 
as the vaccines covered by the ncvi act include vaccines for the prevention of diphtheria  tetanus  pertussis  polio and hib  the company s dtap  ipv and hib vaccines have certain protection from liability claims 
while none of the company s other products are presently covered by the ncvi act  from time to time there are legislative and regulatory proposals to expand the list of vaccines covered by  and to reduce the excise taxes that fund  the program 
the company is unable to predict whether any other legislative or regulatory proposal will ultimately be enacted or the effect any of these proposals may ultimately have on the company s business or results of future operations 
the testing and marketing of vaccine products involve an inherent risk of product liability 
the company has limited product liability insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that adequate additional insurance coverage will be available at acceptable cost  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not materially adversely affect the company s business or financial condition 
if not covered by insurance  the company faces potential liability that could be substantial in the event of claims 
employees as of december   the company had full time employees of whom have phd degrees and two have phd degrees 
of these employees  were engaged in research  development and production activities  were engaged in administration  and were engaged in quality regulatory and related aspects of the company s operations 
the company considers its relationship with employees to be satisfactory 
risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  readers should consider the following risk factors 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements covered by the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s business and prospects 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section 
lack of profitability 
the company has operated at a loss since its inception and its net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million 
the company expects additional losses during  and there can be no assurance that the company will become profitable thereafter 
to become profitable  the company must 
timely and efficiently expand production capacity and output for its acellular pertussis vaccine products  
increase commercial sales of certiva trademark and products licensed in europe  
obtain regulatory approvals for new products and produce and market those products efficiently  successfully and in sufficient quantities  and 
obtain milestone and other payments under existing and new collaborative agreements 
see risk factors no assurance of effective marketing  risk factors risks associated with limited production capacity and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
risk associated with lack of availability of capital 
to maintain the company s production  research  development and growth at current levels  present cash and cash equivalents  expected product sales of certiva trademark and the company s other products  and revenues from existing collaborative agreements are not expected to provide sufficient cash to fund the company s operations  debt service payments and capital expenditures in and into as a result  the company intends to enter into new license  marketing  distribution and or development agreements that are currently under active discussion  liquidate its investment securities  enter into a sale and lease back of the company s one owned facility  and obtain one or more lines of credit  which may be secured by accounts receivable  inventory or other assets of the company 
the company believes that it may meet cash requirements for operations through these efforts  although there are no assurances in this regard 
this is a forward looking statement and the factors that will determine whether the company will require additional funding include  without limitation  the amount and timing of product sales  the amount and timing of payments under existing and new collaborative agreements and the amount of any proceeds from other previously identified funding sources 
if the company is unable to complete one or more of these transactions and or proceeds from the transactions are inadequate  the company would be required to obtain additional funding through the sale of debt and or equity securities 
the company has no current plans  agreements  commitments  arrangements  or understandings relating to the placement or issuance of any securities 
during the course of the year  the company will evaluate its need for additional debt or equity financing to meet its cash requirements for and if the company determines that such additional financing is required but is not available  then the company would have to reduce its cash requirements through significant reductions in operating levels 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms or in amounts required to meet future cash requirements  or that the company  if necessary  would be successful in reducing operating levels  or that if operating levels are reduced  the company would be able to maintain operations for any extended period of time 
see item selected financial data and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
no assurance of effective marketing 
the company is now implementing its initial marketing and sales plan for certiva trademark in the united states 
the company markets certiva trademark to government purchasers and  through a distribution agreement with abbott  markets certiva trademark to private physicians and managed care organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company or abbott will successfully implement their respective sales and marketing strategies 
factors affecting successful commercial launch of the company s vaccines in the united states include 
establishing an identity and reputation for the company and its products  
increasing awareness among pediatricians of the safety and efficacy of the company s vaccines  
distinguishing the company s products from those of its competitors  
establishing the company as an effective and reliable supplier of vaccines  
establishing efficient and consistent production of sufficient quantities of vaccine  and 
establishing effective distribution channels 
in addition  the company has entered into supply  marketing and distribution agreements with third parties under which these parties have agreed to market certain of the company s products  such as certiva trademark eu and the dtap ipv vaccine  in designated territories 
as a result of this arrangement  the company s revenues from product sales in europe and other territories depend upon the timing  implementation and effectiveness of the sales  marketing and distribution efforts of others 
in addition  the company may not be successful in negotiating and executing marketing and or distribution agreements with any other third parties and these other third parties may be unable to market the company s products successfully 
see business business relationships 
risks associated with limited production capacity 
the company s manufacturing facility has limited production capacity based on the present size  configuration  equipment  processes and methods used to produce its products 
in addition  production expenses are mainly fixed and consist primarily of expenses relating to the operation of its production facilities and maintaining a ready work force 
further  from time to time  the company experiences disruptions and production failures 
these disruptions and failures increase unit production costs as units are lost in the production process 
these factors have contributed to higher production costs for the company s acellular pertussis products  which costs currently exceed their respective net selling prices 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the company is addressing this issue by modifying its existing facilities and operations in a manner intended to significantly expand production capacity and efficiency 
these enhancements are presently scheduled to be completed in the latter half of  although there are no assurances in this regard 
following completion of these enhancements  the company believes that the manufacturing facility will have substantially increased production capacity and output  that unit production costs will be reduced significantly and that certiva trademark will be produced in sufficient quantities and efficiencies to generate a gross profit based on current known pricing arrangements  current competitive environment and projected mix of customer purchases 
the previous paragraph includes forward looking statements and  the company s ability to timely and efficiently expand its production capacity depends  in large part  upon the following 
adequacy of engineering designs  
availability of needed equipment  
manufacturing experience with these enhancements  
timeliness of regulatory review of modifications  and 
acceptability of the modifications to applicable regulatory authorities 
the company s plans to increase production capacity and output could be ineffective or may not result in production efficiencies that cover future production costs 
failure to increase production capacity and output could limit the company s ability to meet market demand or achieve profitability 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
risks associated with manufacturing and scale up 
the production of vaccines is a highly complex  biological process involving many steps from seed culture through final production 
thus  the company s production process could fail or become subject to substantial disruptions that impede its ability to meet production requirements 
from time to time  the company experiences disruptions and production failures 
there is no assurance that the company can adequately address such failures or that production failures will not continue in the future 
these disruptions and failures 
limit the company s production capacity  
increase its production costs  which would affect the company s prospects for profitability  and 
could have a negative impact on the company s existing licenses for its products and delay or inhibit its ability to obtain additional regulatory approvals for its products 
in addition  the company may not consistently produce its vaccines in quantity and quality sufficient to achieve competitive commercial sales or profitability 
the company s manufacturing operations for certiva trademark and its acellular pertussis vaccine are located principally in one facility 
any condition or event that adversely affects the operation of this facility would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and future results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
risk related to significant level of indebtedness 
the company currently has a significant level of indebtedness 
as of december   the company s consolidated indebtedness and capitalized lease obligations were approximately million  including million of convertible subordinated notes notes and million of convertible secured notes notes 
this level of indebtedness could have material consequences for the company such as 
impairing the company s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  and general corporate or other purposes  and 
limiting the availability of a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations  as it will be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on its indebtedness 
the company s ability to service its indebtedness will depend upon its future operating performance and the availability of capital 
the company may not generate sufficient increases in cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness 
in that case  the company could attempt to refinance such indebtedness 
there can be no assurance  however  that any refinancing would be available to the company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risk of foreclosure of collateral for notes 
the notes are secured by a pledge of collateral  which includes certain of the company s equipment and other assets at the company s principal manufacturing facility and the company s ownership rights in us patent no 
 entitled vaccines against group c neisseria meningitidis the patent 
if the company defaulted on its obligations under the notes and the holders of these notes foreclosed on the collateral  the company s ability to operate its business may be substantially impaired 
dependence on suppliers 
while the company produces the pertussis component of certiva trademark  it has purchased  and intends to continue to purchase  required diphtheria and tetanus toxoids from ssi and enhanced ipv from ssi and another supplier 
these suppliers may not fulfill the company s requirements  their components may not be supplied on commercially reasonable terms  or they may experience difficulties in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals or disruptions in their production of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids or ipv 
any of the foregoing could significantly affect the company s operations 
certain of the company s production processes require raw materials from sole sources or materials that are difficult for suppliers to produce and certify to the company s specifications 
the company also may experience temporary or permanent shortages of critical raw materials necessary for continued production of its vaccines 
any shortage of these materials could delay production efforts  adversely impact production costs and yields  or necessitate the use of substitute materials  any of which could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operations 
in addition  the company has contracted with third parties for certain product testing and for the sterile fill  labeling and packaging of its vaccine products 
failure of any such contractor to meet the company s requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company  may involve costly delays and significant expense  and would require additional regulatory approval as the company seeks alternative arrangements 
competition and technological change 
competition in the vaccine industry is intense 
competitors of the company both in the united states and internationally include major pharmaceutical and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions 
many of these competitors are actively developing competing vaccines 
three competitors have received fda approval for their dtap vaccine for use in infants and children 
if these competitors are successful in developing and marketing combination vaccines that include dtap vaccines  then these combination vaccines may gain market share at the expense of stand alone dtap vaccines  including certiva trademark 
one of those competitors has announced that the fda licensed a vaccine for administration at months of age that combines that company s hib vaccine with its dtap vaccine by reconstitution 
this same competitor is also seeking fda approval for administration at two  four and six months of age 
another competitor has reported that it is in clinical trials for a dtap hib combination vaccine 
in addition  several dtap vaccines and dtap combination vaccines are licensed for sale outside of the united states 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources  more extensive experience in conducting clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals for their products  greater operating experience  larger research and development and marketing staffs  and greater production capabilities than the company 
these factors may be particularly advantageous because the vaccine industry is subject to significant technological change 
the company s competitors could also gain a competitive advantage by designing around the company s patents  and developing technologies and products that are as or more effective than any that have been or are being developed by the company 
they could also develop technologies and products that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and noncompetitive 
changes in government purchasing policies 
children in the united states receive immunizations from private providers and public providers  such as local health departments 
immunizations provided by public providers are generally funded through federal and state government public health programs 
government purchases historically have been at prices substantially below those offered to the private sector and presently account for a substantial portion of the vaccine doses distributed in the united states 
in the united states  federal and state governments historically have purchased dtap and other vaccines from multiple suppliers 
there can be no assurances that this practice will continue 
from time to time  legislative and regulatory initiatives are proposed that  if adopted  could significantly modify government vaccine programs 
these initiatives could materially affect the federal government s purchasing authority  the contract award process  or the funding available for government vaccine purchases 
the company is unable to predict which legislative initiative  if any  will ultimately be enacted or the effect any such initiative may ultimately have on the company s business or results of future operations 
in addition  proposals for health care  insurance and tax reform may be considered in the future by federal and state governments and some of these proposals  if adopted  may limit government or third party  private reimbursement policies  or prices charged by pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturers for their products 
government regulation  regulatory approvals 
the company s vaccine products  product development activities and manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda 
fda regulation includes preclinical and clinical testing requirements and inspection and approval processes 
to date  the company has received fda approval for only one product 
approval of the company s products for commercial introduction in the united states currently requires both a license for each product and a license for each production facility 
obtaining licenses can be costly and time consuming 
there can be no assurance that the licenses will be granted  or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to market products 
there also can be no assurance that any products under development by the company will demonstrate the safety or efficacy profiles necessary for regulatory approval  or that the company s products under development or its production facilities will receive the requisite regulatory approvals and licenses in a timely fashion or at all 
moreover  fda granted licenses may impose limitations that affect the commercialization of the product  including limitations on product use and requirements for post licensure testing 
the fda can withdraw approvals at any time by following appropriate regulatory procedures 
the fda can also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of the company s products both in the united states and abroad and can require recalls of products 
fda regulations depend heavily on administrative and scientific interpretation and advisory committee determinations 
such interpretations  with possible prospective and retroactive effect  could adversely affect the company 
in addition  the fda and various state agencies inspect the company and its facilities from time to time to determine whether the company is in compliance with regulations  including manufacturing  testing  recordkeeping  quality control and labeling practices 
if such entities find that the company is in material violation of these regulations  the company could be subject to  among other things  product recalls  suspensions or withdrawals of licenses  revocation or suspension of export authorizations  and denials of any pending applications 
uncertainties related to clinical trials 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any products under development  the company must demonstrate through pre clinical studies and clinical trials that these products are safe and effective 
the results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in large scale clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that large scale clinical trials for any of the company s products will demonstrate safety and efficacy  be sufficient to support application for regulatory approval  or lead to marketable products 
a number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier trials 
patent protection and proprietary information 
traditionally  the vaccine industry has placed importance on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products and processes 
the company believes that this protection will be an important factor in its success and may require the expenditure of substantial resources 
many companies  universities and research institutions have applied for and or obtained patents for vaccine products and technologies that may be competitive or inconsistent with those held by or licensed to the company 
no assurances can be given that the degree and range of protection of any patents will be sufficient  that additional patents will be issued to the company  or that the company will not infringe upon patents granted to others 
further  others have or may independently develop or otherwise properly gain access to technology or information that is substantially similar to that which is unpatented yet considered proprietary by the company 
the company also may desire or be required to obtain licenses from others to effectively develop  produce and market commercially viable products 
failure to obtain those licenses could have a significant adverse effect on the company s ability to commercialize its vaccine products 
there can be no assurance that the company can obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  that the patents underlying these licenses will be valid and enforceable or that the proprietary nature of the unpatented technology underlying these licenses will remain proprietary 
there has been  and the company believes that there may be in the future  significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if the company becomes involved in this type of litigation  it could consume substantial resources 
risk of product liability and limited insurance 
the testing and marketing of vaccine products involve an inherent risk of product liability 
the company has limited product liability insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that adequate additional insurance coverage will be available at acceptable cost  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not materially adversely affect the company s business or financial condition 
if not covered by insurance  the company faces potential liability that could be substantial in the event of claims 
dependence on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
the company s success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to attract or retain such personnel 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect the company 
dividends and taxation 
the company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock 
the company intends to retain earnings  if any  to finance the growth and development of its business and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
moreover  any profits earned by the company s us subsidiary will be declared and paid as a dividend to the company  and the company will in turn declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders 
each such dividend would be subject to a withholding tax 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
impact of becoming a passive foreign investment company 
if more than a certain percentage of the company s assets or income becomes passive  the company would be classified as a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result  us taxpayers who receive certain dividends from the company or who sell shares of the company s common stock would be subject to additional federal income tax 
there are no assurances that the company will continue to be successful in avoiding pfic classification 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters  and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
voting control by principal shareholders 
the principal shareholders of the company  biochem and dr 
phillip frost  either directly or through affiliates  are parties to a shareholders agreement requiring  among other things  that the company s common stock covered by the agreement be voted together for the election of directors 
as of december   these principal shareholders beneficially owned approximately million shares of the company s outstanding common stock  which represented approximately of the then outstanding shares of the company s common stock

revenue in consisted of million from product sales to ssi and million of revenue from collaborative agreements of which million was from an agreement with pasteur merieux connaught 
production expenses were million in compared to million in the increase in these expenses in is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of production and service related employees as the company prepared for regulatory approval of certiva trademark 
the increase was offset in part by lower depreciation expense related to the use of an accelerated depreciation method and to the capitalization of certiva trademark inventory for sale in the united states following fda approval 
costs attributable to certiva trademark production were expensed until regulatory approval was obtained in july since fda approval  production costs have exceeded the net realizable value of inventory produced  which excess has been recorded as production expenses incurred in research and development expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease is attributable primarily to lower depreciation expense related to the use of an accelerated depreciation method  reduced expenses for clinical trials  and reimbursements for expenses under a collaborative agreement 
these decreases were offset in part by higher labor expenses as a result of an increase in the number of employees and higher building costs 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease is due to the recognition of a non cash compensation expense of approximately million and a non recurring royalty payment both incurred in  offset in part by higher labor expenses as a result of an increase in the number of employees 
interest and dividend income decreased to million in from million in this reduction is due primarily to a decrease in the average cash balance

liquidity and capital resources  outlook the company s cash requirement for operations for the fourth quarter and year ended december  was million and million  respectively 
for the quarter and year ended december   cash requirements for operations were million and million  respectively 
the company s cash requirement for operations is the net cash used in operating activities for the period being reported less amounts received under license  marketing  distribution and or development agreements and further adjusted by the timing of proceeds from the sale of an investment in an affiliate 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  and investment securities in an affiliate with a market value of million 
the investment consisted of  shares of ivax common stock 
the fair market value of such stock as of january  was approximately million 
this investment is volatile and therefore subject to significant fluctuations in value 
in addition  the company had million of restricted cash pledged as collateral under the letter of credit agreement  which will be reduced in amount as payments are made under the equipment lease described above 
projected results from operations 
the company anticipates that it will report a net loss of between and million for each of the first and second quarters of  and that it will likely continue to incur quarterly net operating losses during the second half of  although projected to be in lesser amounts  based upon several factors 
the factors contributing to the projected losses include  among others limited projected revenues  current manufacturing limitations  the timing and amount of milestone payments under existing collaboration agreements  and the timing and amount of up front and other payments under anticipated license  distribution  marketing and collaboration agreements  all as more completely discussed in the following paragraphs 
as described above  quarterly operating results will be affected by the revenue associated with the launch of certiva trademark  which began during the middle of the fourth quarter of initial revenues from the sale of certiva trademark  although encouraging  were limited and the reported net sales during the fourth quarter of were approximately million  representing approximately a six percent market share in the public sector for that period 
the company anticipates growing but limited revenues during as certiva trademark continues to be introduced to us pediatricians and other vaccine purchasers and as its acellular pertussis toxoid is sold to ssi for further manufacturing and sale in ssi s territory 
moreover  the company s national marketing authorization for the sale and distribution of its dtap ipv vaccine is pending in germany and austria 
the company is presently developing  with chiron behring  a product launch schedule  which should contribute to further revenues during for the reasons described below  however  revenues associated with certiva trademark sales and further product launches are not expected to be sufficient to achieve profitability during and into as noted above  quarterly operating results will be affected by various manufacturing limitations 
the company s manufacturing facility has limited production capacity based on the present size  configuration  equipment  processes and methods utilized to produce certiva trademark and its acellular pertussis toxoid 
in addition  production expenses are mainly fixed and consist primarily of expenses relating to the operation of its production facility and maintaining a ready work force 
further  from time to time  the company experiences disruptions and production failures 
these disruptions and failures increase unit production costs as units are lost in the production process 
these factors have contributed to higher production costs for the company s acellular pertussis products  which costs currently exceed their net realizable value 
these excess costs are expensed in the quarter incurred 
thus  during the first three quarters of  the company expects that costs to produce certiva trademark and the acellular pertussis toxoid will exceed their respective net selling prices 
the company is modifying its existing facilities and operations in a manner intended to significantly expand production capacity and efficiency 
these enhancements are presently scheduled to be completed in the latter half of following completion of these enhancements  the company believes that the manufacturing facility will have substantially increased production capacity and output  that unit production costs will be reduced significantly and that certiva trademark would be produced in sufficient quantities to generate a gross profit based on current known pricing arrangements  current competitive environment  and projected mix of customer purchases 
finally  as noted above  future operating results are dependent upon the amount and timing of further milestone and other payments under existing and new license  distribution or development agreements 
during  the company will be continuing its development efforts for several products  including those covered by existing marketing  license and research agreements 
as noted above  the company is entitled under those agreements to milestone payments upon achievement of prescribed events 
in addition  the company is entitled to be paid for certain prescribed development costs as incurred 
the milestone payments under the existing agreements are tied to measured progress in the regulatory process for the company s combination and group b meningococcal vaccines 
although initial clinical development plans have been completed for these products  and clinical trials are projected to commence during  there are no assurances that such milestone events will occur during  or at all  or that any such payments will contribute materially to quarterly net operating results 
in addition  the company is considering executing further distribution agreements for its products in certain markets throughout the world 
the company also has identified certain vaccines for which it intends to seek collaborative agreements for the purpose of expediting the further development and commercialization of the targeted products 
the company has begun this process with the intention of expeditiously completing these additional collaborative agreements 
the company is also in various stages of discussions with third parties regarding various business arrangements 
there are no assurances that the company will successfully negotiate and sign any such agreements or that  if executed  the financial terms for any such agreement will be significant 
the foregoing paragraphs include forward looking statements including statements as to revenue projections and assessments for further regulatory approvals  the ability of the company to timely and efficiently expand its production capacity and lower unit costs  the ability of the company to address production failures  among others 
the factors that affect the level of future revenues from product sales include  among other things  the ability of the company and its distribution partners to effectively position the company s products against competitive products including safety  efficacy  and pricing  the company s ability to manufacture and deliver products in accordance with customer orders  the timing and amount of product orders  and the timing of future product launches 
the factors that affect the ability of the company to timely and efficiently expand its production capacity include  among others  the adequacy of engineering designs  the availability of needed equipment  the manufacturing experience with these enhancements  the timeliness of regulatory review of modifications  and the acceptability of such modifications to the applicable regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurances that the company s plans to increase production capacity and output will be effective or result in anticipated production efficiencies and reduced unit cost or will be acceptable to any regulatory agency 
in addition  there are no assurances that the steps taken by the company to address production disruption and failures will be effective or that failures will not continue in the future 
production disruptions or failures could have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results and could affect the company s existing licenses as well as any applications for approval for its products or the timing of such approval 
no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in maintaining consistent and continuous commercial production of its products 
further  because the company s manufacturing operations are located principally in one facility  any condition or event that adversely affects the condition or operation of such facility would have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and future results of operations

the cash requirements for operations in the first quarter of are projected to be between and million and between and million for the first quarter cash requirement is anticipated to be lower than that incurred in the fourth quarter of due primarily to the semi annual interest payment of million on the notes paid on november  the foregoing is a forward looking statement and the factors which affect the actual cash required for operations could include  among other things the production levels of vaccine product for commercial sale  the production of vaccine for clinical investigations  marketing costs associated with the launch of certiva trademark in the united states  timing of regulatory authorization to commence clinical investigations  timing for the commencement of planned clinical trials  and the level of expenditures for the company s ongoing research and development program 
capital expenditures 
total capital expenditures for were million  excluding a million tenant improvement allowance provided to the company under the terms of the research facility lease 
as noted above  the company is expanding its manufacturing capacity and efficiency for its acellular pertussis toxoid and certiva trademark 
total projected capital expenditures for for facilities modifications  equipment  systems and other capital additions could range between million to million  with about to million to be expended in the first quarter of the foregoing include forward looking statements 
the amount of and timing for capital expenditures could fluctuate based upon a number of factors including  without limitation the equipment purchases required in order to expand the company s production capacity and the amount and timing of unanticipated costs to replace or repair existing equipment and systems in order to keep facilities operational and in compliance with regulatory requirements 
funding sources 
to maintain the company s production  research  development and growth at current levels  present cash and cash equivalents  expected product sales of certiva trademark and the company s other products  and revenues from existing collaborative agreements are not expected to provide sufficient cash to fund the company s operations  debt service payments and capital expenditures in and into as a result  the company intends to enter into new license  marketing  distribution and or development agreements that are currently under active discussion  liquidate its investment securities  enter into a sale and lease back of the company s one owned facility  and obtain one or more lines of credit  which may be secured by accounts receivable  inventory or other assets of the company 
the company believes that it may meet cash requirements for operations through these efforts  although there are no assurances in this regard 
this is a forward looking statement and the factors that will determine whether the company will require additional funding include  without limitation  the amount and timing of product sales  the amount and timing of payments under existing and new collaborative agreements and the amount of any proceeds from other previously identified funding sources 
if the company is unable to complete one or more of these transactions and or proceeds from the transactions are inadequate  the company would be required to obtain additional funding through the sale of debt and or equity securities 
the company has no current plans  agreements  commitments  arrangements  or understandings relating to the placement or issuance of any securities 
during the course of the year  the company will evaluate its need for additional debt or equity financing to meet its cash requirements for and if the company determines that such additional financing is required but is not available  then the company would have to reduce its cash requirements through significant reductions in operating levels 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms or in amounts required to meet future cash requirements  or that the company  if necessary  would be successful in reducing operating levels  or that if operating levels are reduced  the company would be able to maintain operations for any extended period of time 
the foregoing paragraphs contain only a partial description of the factors affecting the company s business prospects and risk factors affecting future operations 
reference is made to the risk factors and other information described elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including in the first paragraph hereof  and appearing elsewhere in this annual report and in the company s filings with the sec  for a more complete description of the risks and uncertainties affecting the company and its business 
tax and other matters accounting and tax impact of consummation of sale of the notes offering 
on november   the date on which the notes were issued  the closing price of the company s common stock was 
as this price exceeded the conversion price for the notes  the company recognized an approximately million beneficial conversion feature  which was recorded as paid in capital in the fourth quarter of the amount recorded to paid in capital was calculated by multiplying the total number of shares then issuable upon conversion of the notes by the difference between the closing price on the issuance date and the conversion price 
this discount also was deemed to be an increase in the effective interest rate of the notes to be reflected as a charge to interest expense and amortized over the period from the issuance date to the date the notes first become convertible 
given that the notes are immediately convertible  the company recognized a corresponding one time interest charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of this interest expense is not deductible for us or canadian income tax purposes 
in addition  with recent amendments to the us tax laws  the notes may be deemed to be disqualified debt instruments  such that the company would not be permitted to deduct the annual million interest payments for us federal tax purposes 
under the new law  if there is a substantial certainty that the notes would be converted as of the date of issuance  they would be disqualified for deductibility purposes 
in the near term  this would reduce the company s net operating losses to be used to offset any future operating profits  and  if the company earns any operating profits while the notes are outstanding  the non deductibility of the interest payments would effectively increase the company s us federal tax liability 
other tax issues 
at december   the company and its subsidiaries had income tax loss carry forwards of approximately million to offset future canadian source income and approximately million to offset future united states taxable income subject to the alternative minimum tax rules in the united states 
if more than a certain percentage of the company s assets or income becomes passive  the company will be classified for us tax purposes as a passive foreign investment company pfic  and a us taxpayer may be subject to an additional federal income tax on receiving certain dividends from the company or selling the company s common stock 
the company has not been classified as a pfic to date  and it intends to  and believes that it can  generate sufficient other income to avoid being classified as a pfic 
this is a forward looking statement and the factors affecting this classification include  among other things  the timing and amount of revenue from product sales  the timing and amount of license fees  milestone payments and development funding under license  marketing  distribution and development agreements  the classification of payments received by the company as active or passive  and the classification of the company s assets as active or passive 
new accounting pronouncements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 earnings per share 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending after december  the company implemented sfas no 
in  retroactive for all periods presented 
sfas no 
requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period 
diluted loss per share includes the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock 
options  warrants and convertible securities that were outstanding at december   and  were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would be anti dilutive 
as a result  the basic and diluted loss per share amounts are identical 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income and no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company has implemented sfas beginning with the first quarter financial statements 
the implementation of this standard did not result in a material impact to the company s financial statements 
the company implemented sfas no 
for the year ended december  and has determined that it currently does not have reportable segments 
product sales in the united states were approximately million  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
product sales to europe were approximately million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all products are currently being manufactured at the company s one production facility in the united states 
the production process  and ultimately product costing  is primarily the same for all of the company s acellular pertussis vaccine products sold in the united states and europe 
because of this  and the relative consistency in selling prices  as well as the nature of the distribution methods utilized by the company  the company does not differentiate and manage its business along geographic lines 
impact of the year issue on the company the year issue is the result of some computers  software and other equipment  including computer code  in which calendar year data is abbreviated to only two digits 
management has initiated a company wide program to prepare the company s information systems for the year based on an internal interim assessment  the company believes that the principal management information system software that is currently being implemented is designed to be year compliant 
however  there can be no assurances in this regard 
the company intends to test the system for year compliance 
the company also uses various off the shelf software applications for the storage and analysis of various types of data and systems 
management is dependent on this software for day to day operations 
the company is currently in the inventory and assessment phases in which it is evaluating all such applications and systems  as well as embedded systems  in order to determine whether or not modifications or replacement will be necessary to achieve year qualification 
this is an ongoing process and the company is unable at this time to assess the impact  if any  this assessment might ultimately have on the company s systems and operations or its future financial position and results of operations 
upon completion of its assessment  the company will commence any required remediation  beginning with its mission critical systems 
the company has not communicated with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to failures by such third parties to remediate their own year issues 
the company has not been advised by its suppliers that costs to obtain year compliance will be passed on to the company  however  there can be no assurances that such costs will not be passed through to the company either directly or indirectly or  if passed through to the company  the magnitude of such charges 
the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely may not be timely converted 
accordingly  there are no assurances that the failure by such other companies systems to achieve year qualification  or qualify in a manner that is compatible to company systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
upon completion of the assessment phase  the company intends to develop contingency plans for various possible scenarios 
the company has determined that it has no exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for product it has sold 
based on the preliminary internal assessment  the company has not identified any material costs or expenditures specifically related to modifications of information systems for year compatibility 
the costs incurred to date in conducting the internal assessment have not been material 
this internal assessment is a continuing process  consequently there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to expend significant amounts on achieving year qualification or that such expenditures will not have a material adverse affect on future results of operations or financial condition 
the company has not yet developed any contingency plans for its operations should any of its systems ultimately prove not to be year compliant 
the foregoing paragraphs contain forward looking statements and the factors affecting the impact of year on the company include  among others  the availability and cost of programming and testing resources  vendors ability to modify proprietary software  unanticipated problems identified in the ongoing compliance assessment  and compliance of material third party suppliers and vendors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at december  the company invests in us treasury bills and investment grade commercial paper that have maturities of three months or less 
as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low  as the investments mature within three months 
the company had million of convertible secured notes at december   which bear interest at per annum and mature in november the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates related to the notes because the interest rate on these notes is fixed 
the company had million of convertible subordinated notes at december   which bear interest at per annum and mature in may the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates related to the notes because the interest rate on these notes is fixed 
the company has not undertaken any actions to cover interest market risk and is not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in the market interest rates over the next year would not materially impact the company s earnings or cash flow as the interest rates on the company s long term convertible debt are fixed and its cash investments are short term 
a hypothetical ten percent change in the market interest rate over the next year  by itself  would not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the company s long term convertible debt or its short term cash investments 
the company does principally all of its transactions in us dollars and currently has limited payment obligations in swedish krona  however  such obligations are not material to the company s operations
