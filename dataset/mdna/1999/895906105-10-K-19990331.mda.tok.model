first  a forecast of net cash flows that were expected to result from the development effort 
second  a percentage of completion estimated by considering a number of factors  including the costs invested to date relative to the expected total cost of the development effort and the amount of progress completed as of the transaction date  on a technological basis  relative to the overall technological achievements required to achieve the intended functionality of the eventual product 
the technological issues were addressed by engineering representatives from both progressive and an independent technology consulting firm engaged by the company 
third  a discount rate of approximately  which represents the company s risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital  was applied to the cash flows resulting from the revenues expected to be generated from the iris project 
as a result of the revised valuation  the amount of purchase price allocated to in process technology decreased from million to million and the amount ascribed to purchased existing and core technology and goodwill and other intangibles increased from million to million

iv the year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to represent the year 
computer programs that have a time sensitive program may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures  miscalculations  temporary inability to process transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
the company has identified the following areas which could be affected by the year issue company products  internally used systems and software  products and or services provided by key third parties and business partners  and internal systems used by key customers 
the company created a year project team to address each area and report their findings to the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the team s assignment is to first identify possible areas of non compliance  second develop a fix or solution to the non compliance  and third to implement and test the fix and or solution 
the company has been performing extensive testing on software products and third party components used in products sold or licensed by the company to its customers 
the company has tested and continues to test its current dos and windows r nt r software releases 
testing is not being performed with respect to legacy products that the company no longer sells or supports

the company currently uses three internal information systems 
each system has been updated with new releases from its vendor to bring the system into year compliance 
two of the three systems have been installed and tested for compliance 
the third system has been installed and is in the process of being tested for year compliance 
the expense incurred to date  as of december   was approximately  the cost to finish the testing will be expensed as incurred and is not expected to be material 
the company has other internal systems that are used in the development of products and services

as of december   the company has received responses from of its customer base 
the company will continue to follow up with the remaining and hopes to have a response by the end of the third quarter however  there can be no absolute assurance that customers will convert their internal systems in a timely manner to avoid a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its current and future communication and actions with customers will minimize these risks 
the company has expensed costs as incurred related to the year analysis and remediation process

b impact of inflation tridex believes that its business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends because of the low rate of inflation during the past three years and cost reduction programs at each of its operations 
tridex believes that any increase in cost due to inflation can be recovered by price increases or offset by cost reductions and productivity improvements
