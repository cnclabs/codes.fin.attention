item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview parlex completed fiscal year with record revenues of million 
despite some first quarter difficulties primarily associated with the establishment of its mexican operation  the company recovered quickly and improved the earnings in each sequential quarter 
the fourth quarter resulted in record sales and earnings 
in our methuen  massachusetts flexible circuit manufacturing site  capacity was increased 
shipments of the patented palflex r product were at greatly improved yields and orders for this product continue to increase 
the salem  new hampshire operation produced laminated cable for hundreds of new applications and increased its capacity by 
parlex shanghai  a chinese joint venture  experienced a increase in revenues and the mexican facility is now fully operational and contributing to the financial plan 
on april   the company acquired the assets of dynaflex from hadco corporation for approximately million 
dynaflex is situated in san jose  california and is a prototype quickturn facility 
although this purchase had a minimum impact in the current year  management believes that this acquisition gives the company a west coast presence and a greatly improved quick turnaround capability 
this capability is significant  since large volume orders often evolve and could lead to additional business at the company s other flexible circuit locations 
the company expended in excess of million in property and equipment and million in research and development 
these expenditures will allow the company to meet increased customer demand for its products  and enable the company to remain at the forefront as a technological leader in the flexible interconnect arena 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected items in the company s statement of operations as a percentage of total revenues 
the table and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto fiscal year ended june  total revenues cost of products sold gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses operating income income from operations before income taxes and minority interest net income total revenues total revenues rose to  in fiscal year  an increase of from the  reported in fiscal year  while revenues rose in fiscal year from the  reported in fiscal year in each of the respective time periods  revenues grew in each of the company s principal product lines flexible circuits  laminated cables  flexible cable hybrid circuits and flexible interconnect assemblies 
the company has been developing new  innovative products that continue to gain acceptance in the marketplace and have been a prime factor in the company s continued growth 
the increase in total revenues in each year was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of units shipped 
total revenues included licensing and royalty fees of   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
although the company intends to continue its practice of developing materials and processes that it can license to third parties  it does not expect that royalty revenues will represent a significant portion of total revenues in the near term 
cost of products sold cost of products sold in fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of products sold was   and in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the slight increase in is the result of the non recurring events in the first quarter of fiscal year as discussed in the form q filing dated september  the company  in the first quarter of the fiscal year  incurred some unanticipated losses in the manufacturing of flexible circuits associated with automotive applications 
product shipped to the company s mexican facility was returned because of an unexpected delay by our customer to qualify the site for finishing operations 
as a result  the material was contaminated during unplanned storage and shipment back to our methuen  massachusetts facility 
these circuits required extensive rework with a significant quantity being scrapped 
the cost of products sold for the remainder of the year was 
in fiscal year  the company benefited from assigning production to the facility most economically suited to manufacture a particular type of product  which resulted in lower costs as a percentage of sales 
this strategy was expanded in with the purchase of dyanflex for the production of prototypes and quickturn production requirements 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal years   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were   and in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company is presently in an expansion mode  increasing its internal sales personnel  adding new field offices  etc 
once the full complement of selling and administrative personnel is in place  the company anticipates that selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease as revenues increase 
other income other income of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  was comprised  for the most part  of interest income 
in fiscal year  other income of  was principally the result of a gain on the sale of equipment 
interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal year versus  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the reduction in expense over the past two years is attributable to a lower level of average borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
interest rates during the period remained relatively constant 
provision for taxes the company s effective tax rate in fiscal year was versus and in fiscal years and  respectively 
this fiscal year  the company benefited from the income generated by the chinese joint venture  which  for most of the year  was not subject to tax 
the company also benefited from an increase in foreign sales  which income is subject to a lower rate of tax 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal year  the company had net income of million  as well as depreciation and amortization of million and other non cash charges of million  thus adding million to cash flow 
cash flow was reduced by million relating to increased working capital  resulting in a positive cash flow from operations of million 
these monies  together with million from maturing investments and available cash from the beginning of the year  were used to purchase approximately million in property and equipment and to pay for an acquisition costing approximately million 
the company has a  unsecured revolving line of credit 
as of june    was borrowed against this line 
the company believes that its cash on hand  its anticipated cash flow from operations  and the amount available under its revolving credit facility  should be sufficient to meet its foreseeable needs 
the company has a deferred compensation obligation that is owed to a key executive of the board of directors 
under the current arrangement  monthly payments were to have begun in june  or the first month after the termination of employment  whichever occurs first  and continues for no fewer than months or  at the election of the employee prior to his termination of employment  for up to months 
subsequent to year end  the executive has elected to have the monies distributed over months  and the disbursements have been appropriately made 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenues  expenses  gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements 
sfas no 
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
sfas no 
was adopted by the company during the first quarter of fiscal year and sfas no 
was adopted by the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year these standards will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
will be adopted by the company during fiscal year the company has not completed an evaluation of the effects of adopting sfas no 
on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and financial statement disclosures 
year disclosure statement the year will affect not only the company s internal computer systems  but also those external systems with which the company exchanges any date related information  its customers  suppliers  banks  insurance companies  stockholders  etc 
in order to properly assess the extent this problem may have on its operations  the company has and is continuing to survey its key suppliers  service providers  and trading partners as to their level of preparedness and the effect it will have on the company s operations 
the company is confident that its enterprise system will be fully year compliant in the first quarter of fiscal year quite apart from the year problem  the company has replaced its legacy computer system with a client server system for which both the hardware and software has been certified as year compliant 
the total external cost of this project is approximately  of which  has been spent through june  the company has completed an inventory of all its mission critical manufacturing systems in order to determine any year issues 
all identified issues have been remediated and as a result the company does not believe that any issues exist which will prevent these systems from operating as expected after january  the testing necessary to validate being year ready is scheduled to be completed by october the year issue does present some risk that the company s operation may suffer disruption as a result of either a computer malfunction or a corruption of date sensitive data 
if in the event this does occur  the company believes that it will most likely be due to factors external to the company  and contingency plans have been prepared to deal with any such occurrence 
these include provisions for extra raw materials above that needed for normal operations  staffing the plant with critical personnel on january st  scheduling the new year s holiday to provide extra time for recovery in the event it is needed  and duplication of production capability at its various facilities 
these contingency plans apply to all company facilities as appropriate 
because of the company s internal year program  the company does not believe there is a significant risk of disruption of operations due to malfunction of its internal systems or equipment 
certain factors that may affect future operating results fluctuations in operating results  variability of orders 
the company s operating results have historically been subject to fluctuations  and the company expects that they will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors  including the timing and volume of orders from  and shipments to  customers  the timing of introductions of and market acceptance of new products and general economic trends 
typically  in the flexible interconnect industry  a substantial portion of sales in a given quarter depends on obtaining orders for products to be manufactured and shipped in the same quarter in which those orders are received 
although the company monitors its customers needs  it often has limited knowledge of the magnitude or timing of future orders 
as a result  the timing of revenues may be affected by the need to ramp up to or down from volume production in response to fluctuations in customer demand  the introduction of replacement products or the balancing of inventory 
a significant decrease in the number  magnitude or timing of orders in any given quarter could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
because it is difficult for the company to readily reduce spending on certain operating expenses  such as fixed manufacturing costs  development costs and ongoing customer service  a reduction in sales could have a material adverse effect on near term profit margins 
results of operations in any given period are therefore not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
expansion of manufacturing 
the company believes its long term competitive position depends in part on its ability to increase its manufacturing capacity 
the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected if the company is not able to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand for its products 
the company intends in the future to expand its manufacturing capacity 
the failure of the company to complete the expansion on schedule and within budget could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  the company is in the process of implementing new operations control and accounting information systems  which may temporarily impact the company s operations 
market and customer concentration 
applications for flexible interconnects include automotive electronics  military aerospace products  computers and computer peripherals  telecommunications subscriber and infrastructure equipment  as well as circuits and cables for medical and industrial applications 
although the company markets products for each of these applications in order to avoid a dependency on any one sector  a significant downturn in any of these market sectors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
historically  the company has sold a substantial portion of its flexible interconnects to a limited number of customers 
in fiscal years   and  respectively  sales to motorola accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenues and the company s top customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenues  respectively 
the company expects that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of its total revenues in the foreseeable future 
the loss of a significant customer or a substantial reduction in orders by any significant customer could reduce the company s cash flow and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
current and future capital needs 
the development and manufacture of flexible interconnects is highly capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  expansion of operations and research and development 
the company expects that substantial capital will be required to expand its manufacturing capacity and fund working capital for anticipated growth 
to the extent the company s financial resources are insufficient to fund these activities  the company will need to raise additional funds either through borrowings or further equity financings 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
the inability of the company to obtain adequate additional financing on reasonable terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  the company s credit facility contains various financial covenants predicated on the company s present and future financial condition 
in the event the company is no longer able to meet the covenants contained in the credit facility  it may be required to repay the debt incurred thereunder 
foreign operations 
the company is currently expanding its operations globally 
the company owns a equity interest in a joint venture in china 
manufacturing and sales operations outside the united states are accompanied by a number of risks inherent in international operations  including imposition of governmental controls  compulsory licensure requirements  compliance with a wide variety of foreign and united states export laws  currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in trade restrictions  tariffs and barriers  political and economic instability  longer payment cycles typically associated with foreign sales  difficulties in administering business overseas  labor union issues and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although the company s current products are designed to meet the regulatory standards of certain foreign countries  any inability to meet foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
competition 
the company s business is highly competitive 
the flexible interconnect industry is differentiated by customers  markets and geography  with each niche having its own combination of complex packaging and interconnect requirements 
the company experiences competition worldwide in the flexible interconnect market from a number of foreign and domestic providers as well as from alternative technologies such as rigid printed circuits 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that existing or future competitors will not be able to duplicate the company s strategies or that the company will continue to be able to compete successfully 
limited sources of supply 
the company purchases raw materials  process chemicals and various components from multiple outside sources 
in fiscal year  the company s largest supplier of raw materials was dupont  from which it purchased in excess of of its materials and supplies 
any unanticipated disruption in shipments from dupont would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
although there are alternative suppliers for raw materials  process chemicals and various components that the company currently purchases from its suppliers  because of the company s limited inventory of raw materials and tight manufacturing cycles  any unanticipated interruption of supply could have a short term material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operation results 
intellectual property 
the company relies on a combination of patent and trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual agreements to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property will be effective in preventing misappropriation or that others may not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to protect the company s proprietary rights or to defend against claims of infringement 
although no claims have been asserted against the company for infringement of the proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims in the future 
if any infringement claim is asserted  the company may be required to obtain a license of such rights 
there can be no assurance that any such license would be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
litigation with respect to patents and other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial and operating results 
technological change 
the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the future success of the company s business will depend in large part upon its ability to maintain and enhance its technological capabilities  develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
in addition  the flexible interconnect industry could in the future encounter competition from new technologies that render interconnect technology less competitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the materials and processes that the company is currently developing will result in commercially viable technological processes or that there will be commercial applications for these technologies 
to the extent that the company determines that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and subsequent implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to continue to require significant capital investment 
the company s failure to keep pace with technological change could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent upon a number of its key management personnel 
in addition  the future success of the company depends on its continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of service of one or more key individuals  or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company maintains a key person life insurance policy in the amount of million on both herbert w 
pollack and peter j 
murphy 
environmental regulations 
the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  the company s products 
the company cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future legislation or regulatory requirements to which its operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted  including whether they will be applied in the future to materials  product or activities to which they have not been applied previously 
complying with new or more stringent laws or regulations  or to more vigorous enforcement of the current or future policies of regulatory agencies  could require substantial expenditures by the company and could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and operating results 
environmental laws and regulations require the company to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in its processes 
violations of those requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions  and could require the company to halt one or more portions of its operations until a violation is cured 
although the company works to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in that effort at all times 
the combined costs of curing incidents of non compliance  resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities or satisfying business requirements following any period affected by the need to take such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks which include changes in us and foreign interest rates and fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company maintains a portion of its cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with purchased maturities of three months or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates decrease 
due to the short duration of these financial instruments  an immediate decrease in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position 
the company also has a revolving credit agreement which bears interest at the bank s corporate base rate which is also affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company owes  as of june   and has the option to repay borrowings at anytime without penalty and therefore believes that the market risk is not material 
the remainder of the company s long term debt bears interest at fixed rates and are therefore not subject to market risk 
the company has a subsidiary located in shanghai  china 
sales are typically denominated in the local currency functional currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the chinese us exchange rate may positively or negatively impact the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
based upon the current volume of transactions in china and the stable nature of the exchange rate between china and the us  the company does not believe the market risk is material 
the company does not engage in regular hedging activities to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
net assets as of march  in china totaled about million 
the company believes that a change in rates would not have a significant impact upon the company s financial position  results of operation  or upon its current outstanding debt of
