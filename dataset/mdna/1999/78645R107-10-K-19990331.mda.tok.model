as a result  software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
the company believes that its products have been made year compliant in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  the company utilizes third party equipment and software in its operations that may not be year compliant 
failure of such third party equipment or software to operate properly with regard to the year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations

as part of the program of the task force  communications will be initiated with key suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to such parties failure to remediate year issues 
furthermore  the purchasing patterns of customers or potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct their current systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to implement the infrastructure needed to conduct trusted and secure communications and commerce over information networks or to purchase products and services such as those offered by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial condition  and results of operations
