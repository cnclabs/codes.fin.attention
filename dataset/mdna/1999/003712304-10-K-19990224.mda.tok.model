year the company s business is dependent upon various computer software programs and operating systems that utilize dates and process data beyond the year the company s actions to address the risks associated with the year are as follows the company s state of readiness the company has established a corporate program to coordinate its year yk compliance efforts across all business functions and geographic areas 
the scope of the program includes addressing the risks associated with the company s i information technology it systems including the company s products and services  ii non it systems that include embedded technology eg  buildings  plant  equipment and other infrastructure  and iii significant vendors and their yk readiness 
the company is utilizing the following steps in executing its yk compliance program awareness  assessment  renovation including upgrades and enhancements to the company s products  validation and testing  and implementation 
the company has completed the awareness and assessment steps for all areas 
it systems 
the renovation step has been substantially completed for all mission critical it systems and products  and the company now is focusing its efforts on validation and testing 
the company s most significant renovation effort involved its core product  ccs 
ccs utilizes one subroutine for calculating dates  with the various computer programs within ccs with date dependent calculations accessing this subroutine 
as a result  all date calculations are performed in one location 
the renovation of this subroutine and the related interfaces to the various date dependent programs has been completed 
the company is now testing ccs and its related software products eg  acsr  acsr telephony  etc 
using its standard testing methodologies  while adding date simulation to specifically address the yk risk 
such date simulation considers pre  cross over  and post time frames  including year leap year considerations 
the company believes it will be completed with its testing for ccs and related software products by december   with the remaining testing expected to be done by the end of the first quarter of implementation into the production environment is expected to occur shortly after testing is completed 
for the company s non ccs related software products  no renovation is believed necessary as the products are relatively new and were designed to be yk compliant 
the company plans to test these products with similar date simulation techniques discussed above to ensure they are yk compliant 
such testing is expected to be substantially completed by the end of non it systems 
the company expects to have all of its mission critical non it systems yk compliant by the end of the first quarter of the company is currently formulating its testing and implementation plans for its mission critical non it systems 
significant vendors 
as part of the company s yk compliance program  the company has contacted its significant vendors to assess their yk readiness 
for all mission critical third party software embedded in or specified for use in conjunction with the company s it systems and products  the company s communications with the vendors indicates that the vendors believe they will be yk compliant by the end of such third party software is being tested in conjunction with the testing of the it systems and products discussed above 
all other significant vendors including the company s vendor who provides data processing services for ccs have indicated they will be yk compliant by the end of  except for one of the company s vendors which provides data lines access for ccs 
this vendor indicates that it expects to be yk compliant by the end of the first quarter of there can be no assurance that i the company s significant vendors will succeed in their yk compliance efforts  or ii the failure of vendors to address year compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the costs to address the company s year issues since inception of its program in through october   the company has incurred and expensed costs of approximately million related to yk compliance efforts 
the total estimated costs to complete the company s yk compliance effort are approximately million 
the estimated costs to complete  which does not include any costs which may be incurred by the company if its significant vendors fail to timely address yk compliance  is based on currently known circumstances and various assumptions regarding future events 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the risks of the company s year issues the company s failure to timely resolve the yk risks could result in system failures  the generation of erroneous information  and other significant disruptions of business activities  including among others  access to ccs and the use of related software products  and timely printing and delivery of clients customers statements 
although the company believes it will be successful in its yk compliance efforts  there can be no assurance that the company s systems and products contain all necessary date code changes 
in addition  the company s operations may be at risk if its vendors and other third parties fail to adequately address the yk issue or if software conversions result in system incompatibilities with these third parties 
to the extent that either the company or a third party vendor or service provider on which the company relies does not achieve yk compliance  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
furthermore  it has been widely reported that a significant amount of litigation surrounding business interruption will arise out of yk issues 
it is uncertain whether  or to what extent  the company may be affected by such litigation 
as is the case with many software companies and service providers  if the company s current or future clients experience significant business interruptions due to their failure to achieve yk compliance  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or future clients will adequately and successfully address their yk risk and not experience any business interruptions 
the company s contingency plan 
the company has not yet developed a comprehensive contingency plan to address the situation that may result if the company or its vendors are unable to achieve yk compliance for its critical operations 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  based upon the status of the company s yk compliance efforts at that time and the company s perceived risks to critical business operations  the company plans to evaluate what areas the company believes a contingency plan may be necessary  and execute such contingency plan if warranted 
the i inability to timely implement a contingency plan  if deemed necessary  and ii the cost to develop and implement such a plan  may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results of operations 
except for statements of existing or historical facts  the foregoing discussion of yk consists of forward looking statements and assumptions relating to forward looking statements  including without limitation the statements relating to future costs  the timetable for completion of yk compliance efforts  potential problems relating to yk  the company s state of readiness  third party representations  and the company s plans and objectives for addressing yk problems 
certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations  including without limitation i the failure of vendors and service providers such as the vendors of data processing services and data lines access for ccs and providers of third party software to timely achieve yk compliance  ii system incompatibilities with third parties resulting from software conversions  iii the company s systems and products not containing all necessary date code changes  iv the failure of existing or future clients to achieve yk compliance  v potential litigation arising out of yk issues  the risk of which may be greater for information technology based service providers such as the company  vi the failure of the company s validation and testing phase to detect operational problems internal to the company  in the company s products or services or in the company s interface with service providers  vendors or clients  whether such failure results from the technical inadequacy of the company s validation and testing efforts  the technological infeasibility of testing certain non it systems  the perceived cost benefit constraints against conducting all available testing  or the unavailability of third parties to participate in testing  or vii the failure to timely implement a contingency plan to the extent yk compliance is not achieved
