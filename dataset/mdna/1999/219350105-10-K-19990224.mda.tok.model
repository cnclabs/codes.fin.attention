item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  appearing on pages through  and note information by operating segment of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing on pages through competition corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied manufacturers  both domestic and foreign 
competition within the telecommunication segment s primary products is intense among several significant companies 
corning represents an important market presence in the segment s principal product lines 
price and new product innovations are significant competitive factors 
within the advanced materials segment  corning s principal products face competition from a variety of material manufacturers  some of which manufacture similar products made from materials other than glass and ceramics 
among other things  innovation  product quality  performance  and service are key competitive elements 
competition is also intense in the information display segment 
primary competitive influences include a worldwide surplus of glass in the conventional television business and increased competition in the asian marketplace  which have recently resulted in a decline in prices 
corning strives to maintain its market position through technology and product innovation 
for the future  corning s competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and development  its financial resources  and its commitment to quality 
raw materials corning s production of specialty glasses and related materials requires significant quantities of energy and batch materials 
although energy shortages have not been a problem recently  corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of the lowest cost energy source in most significant processes 
specifically  corning s principal manufacturing processes can now be operated with natural gas  propane  oil or electricity  or a combination of these energy sources 
as to resources ores  minerals  and processed chemicals required in manufacturing operations  availability appears to be adequate 
corning s suppliers from time to time may experience capacity limitations in their own operations  or may eliminate certain product lines  nevertheless  corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals and raw materials 
for many products  corning has alternative glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages 
patents and trademarks inventions by members of corning s research and engineering staff have been  and continue to be  important to the company s growth 
patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the united states and other countries 
some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers  including corning s associated companies 
many of the earlier patents have now expired 
most of corning s products are marketed under the following trademarks corning  celcor  costar  fibergain  hpfs  leaf  pyrex  steuben and vycor 
subsidiaries and divisions of corning frequently use their own trademarks 
protection of the environment corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state  federal and foreign pollution control regulations 
this program resulted in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years 
in order to maintain compliance with such regulations  capital expenditures for pollution control by continuing operations were approximately million in and are estimated to be million in corning s operating results from continuing operations were charged with approximately million for depreciation  maintenance  waste disposal  and other operating expenses associated with pollution control 
the level of these costs is expected to increase slightly in due to depreciation costs associated with capital expenditures 
corning believes that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage

part ii item market for the registrant s common stock and related security holder matters this information is included in quarterly operating results and related market data  five years in review historical comparison  and investor information  appearing on pages through item selected financial data this information is included in five years in review historical comparison appearing on pages and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corning s strategy is to focus its resources on growth opportunities in its telecommunications  advanced materials and information display segments 
during  this objective was evidenced through facility and capacity expansion and an increase in research and development spending within corning s growth businesses 
following a record year in  corning s results were adversely impacted throughout by the effects of the asian economic slowdown  which began in the fourth quarter of these effects  which included a substantial reduction in prices in many businesses and a downward shift in customer demand for certain corning products  were most significant in the first half of the year and caused net income for the first half of to be down significantly in comparison to net income for the same period in during the second half of the year  corning benefited from an increase in new premium fiber product sales and stronger results in many other businesses  due in part to restructuring and other cost reduction programs 
as a result  comparisons in the second half were better than the first  however  net income for the year was down from looking forward  corning is optimistic that it will resume overall earnings growth in  and is committed to continued investment in the development of new products in all three operating segments 
results of continuing operations consolidated sales in were billion  down slightly from significant pricing pressures in many key businesses accelerated by the continued volatility in the asian marketplace were mostly offset by volume gains primarily in the telecommunications segment 
strong demand for optical fiber and cable products in drove consolidated sales to a increase over income from continuing operations totaled million  or per share  in compared with income from the same operations of million  or per share  in  and million  or per share  in net income and earnings per share in include a restructuring charge of million million after tax and minority interest  or per share  and non operating gains totaling million million after tax  or per share  from the merger between molecular simulations  inc and pharmacopeia  inc and the divestiture of several small science products businesses 
excluding the restructuring charge and the non operating gains  corning s income and earnings per share from continuing operations were million  or per share  a decline of from results of the same operations in the decrease in earnings primarily reflects a significant decline in the performance of the telecommunications segment  a modest decline in the results of the advanced materials segment and improved operating performance of the information display segment 
in  corning s income and earnings per share from continuing operations increased and  respectively  over results from the same operations in earnings in reflect strong performance in the telecommunications segment  increased earnings from the advanced materials segment and improved results in the information display segment 
operating segments corning s products and services are grouped into three operating segments telecommunications  advanced materials and information display 
the earnings of equity affiliates  which are closely associated with corning s operating segments  are included in segment net income 
additional information on the acquisitions and divestitures discussed in the segment analysis is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the financial results for corning s three operating segments have been prepared on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which corning management internally disaggregates financial information for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions 
in this regard  certain common expenses have been allocated among segments differently than would be required for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
telecommunications in millions net sales    segment earnings before minority interest and equity earnings minority interest equity in earnings of associated companies segment net income sales in the telecommunications segment were flat in compared to  as significant declines in the optical fiber and cable businesses offset gains in the photonic technologies and hardware and equipment businesses 
segment net income decreased significantly in primarily due to a decline in the profitability of optical fiber and cable  higher research and development spending and lower equity earnings 
optical fiber and cable sales decreased substantially in  as strong volume growth in the domestic fiber markets was more than offset by pricing declines  particularly within the international fiber markets 
domestic volume growth continues to be driven by regional  local and long haul telephone companies and cable television operators who are installing optical fiber to increase network capacity  reducing operating costs and adding new services

this investment is expected to improve geographic market access for optical fiber produced in corning s domestic production facilities 
sales and earnings of this business were not significant in and the photonic technologies business experienced sales growth of more than in following growth of in this growth reflects a substantial increase in volume of fiber gain modules and the introduction of new products 
sales in also reflected increased volume and the second quarter acquisition of optical corporation of america  a worldwide supplier of opto electronic components 
the growth in sales over the last three years has been more than offset by costs related to expanding production facilities and by substantial research and development spending  which more than doubled in and resulted in the business incurring a loss in all three years 
in  corning substantially completed construction of a million production facility near corning  new york 
sales and earnings in corning s telecommunications hardware and equipment business increased slightly in as volume gains and cost reduction efforts offset price declines 
in  sales and earnings in the business increased as volume gains offset costs associated with the consolidation of certain plant operations 
outlook sales in the telecommunications segment are expected to increase significantly in  primarily due to stronger demand for fiber  cable and photonic technology products throughout the global marketplace  offset somewhat by continued pricing pressures 
segment sales will also be favorably impacted by the consolidation of optical fibres  which had sales of approximately million in segment net income is expected to resume double digit growth in as sales gains in the fiber  cable and photonic businesses will more than offset increased research and development spending in photonics and the costs associated with the completion of the concord plant

earnings in were impacted by development and promotional spending for new photochromic plastic products in the optical products business 
earnings increased in primarily due to performance improvements in the lighting products business  which were partially offset by development spending in the optical products business 
segment earnings also include equity earnings from eurokera and keraglass  snc  a french based manufacturer of glass ceramic cooktops 
earnings of this business increased in and  as a result of the growing demand for glass ceramic cooktops both in europe and the united states  offset somewhat by expansion costs and development spending on new products 
eurokera has begun an expansion of their facility in france that will increase its production capacity by outlook segment sales in are expected to be up slightly in comparison with levels  as volume gains from advanced life science products within the science products business  increased demand for high purity fused silica products from the semiconductor materials business  modest growth in the environmental products business  and the introduction of new photochromic plastic lens products from the optical products business offset continued softness in the demand for glass lens products 
segment net income is expected to increase in  reflecting anticipated growth in the semiconductor materials and optical products businesses and planned manufacturing efficiencies within all segment businesses  offset in part by higher research and development spending in the science and optical products businesses

corning has agreed to indemnify quest diagnostics on an after tax basis for the settlement of certain government claims and against certain other claims that were pending at december  coincident with the distributions  corning recorded a payable to quest diagnostics of approximately million  which was equal to management s best estimate of amounts which were probable of being paid by corning to quest diagnostics to satisfy the remaining indemnified claims on an after tax basis 
although management believes that recorded reserves for indemnified claims are sufficient  it is possible that additional information may become available to quest diagnostics management  which may cause the final resolution of these matters to exceed established reserves by an amount which could be material to corning s results of operations and cash flow in the period in which such claims are settled 
management does not believe that these issues will have a material adverse impact on corning s overall financial condition

environment corning has been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by such agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
corning has accrued approximately million for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at december  effects of inflation amounts reflected in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on operations or financial position 
the expenses and asset values  specifically those related to long lived assets  reflect historical cost and do not necessarily represent replacement cost or charges to operations based on replacement cost 
corning s operations provide funds from operations which  along with other sources  are sufficient to replace fixed assets as necessary 
net income would be lower than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected by charging operations for replacement costs 
year readiness disclosure corning has completed an assessment of required modifications or replacement of its key internal software to become year compliant 
the assessment involved all known areas of concern  including business applications  manufacturing  engineering  research  facilities systems  third party suppliers and service providers 
implementation  including testing  of required changes to key applications was substantially completed at december   with the remainder to be completed by the middle of in addition  an external study team is assisting management in evaluating its processes surrounding the year project

corning has initiated formal communications with all of its significant customers  suppliers and other third parties to determine the extent to which corning is vulnerable to third parties failures to remediate their own potential problems related to the year risk assessments  readiness evaluation and contingency plans to protect corning s business from year related interruptions from these third parties and from key customers are expected to be completed before december  contingency plans will include  for example  stocking of additional inventory and identifying alternative suppliers 
corning s risk management program includes emergency backup and recovery procedures to be followed in the event of a failure of a key application 
this program is being expanded to include specific procedures for potential year issues 
corning is taking what it considers to be reasonable steps to prevent major interruptions in its business due to year issues 
the inability of corning or significant third parties to adequately address year issues could cause inefficiencies in corning s business operations 
the extent to which corning s operating results may be impacted by customers or suppliers who are not fully year compliant is not readily determinable 
corning s operating results and ability to conduct business is dependent upon the infrastructure of the geographic regions in which its operations and customers are located

corning selectively enters into foreign exchange forward contracts with durations generally less than months to hedge its exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
the hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on corning s operating results 
corning does not hold any derivative contracts that hedge its foreign currency denominated net asset exposures 
in addition  one of corning s subsidiaries enters into revenue sales contracts for certain of its revenues generated in foreign currencies 
such contracts are not subject to foreign currency gains or losses 
corning does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
equity in earnings of associated companies represented of corning s income from continuing operations in foreign based affiliates comprised of this amount 
exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies 
corning uses sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   corning and its consolidated subsidiaries had open forward contracts  foreign denominated debt and foreign cash and cash equivalent holdings with values exposed to exchange rate movements 
a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
the effect of a change in exchange rates on the revenue sales contracts is excluded from this analysis as any movement will be offset by a corresponding effect on the underlying revenues 
corning s market risk exposures have not changed materially from december  new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
fas requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
corning currently enters into derivatives in the form of foreign currency hedge instruments to reduce its exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
management believes that its current foreign currency hedge instruments qualify as hedges under fas fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and is not expected to have a material effect on corning s financial position or results of operations
