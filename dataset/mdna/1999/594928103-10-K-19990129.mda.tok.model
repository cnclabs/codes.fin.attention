fiscal year ended november  versus fiscal year ended november  total revenue 
total revenue during fiscal was billion 
pinacor distribution business revenues totaled billion and microage it services integration revenues totaled billion 
on a consolidated basis  these revenues were partially offset by eliminations of intercompany revenues of billion 
total revenue increased billion  or  for the fiscal year ended november  as compared to the fiscal year ended november  this revenue increase included a million  or  increase  in pinacor revenue and a million  or  increase in microage it services revenue  partially offset by an increase in intercompany eliminations 
the increase in consolidated revenue was attributable to sales to resellers added since november   increased demand for the company s major suppliers products  improved product availability  the company s addition of new product offerings  the growth of the microcomputer products industry and acquisitions of reseller locations 
gross profit percentage 
the company s gross profit percentage was for the fiscal year ended november  and for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease in the company s gross profit percentage was due to lower margins on pinacor sales combined with the fact that microage it services revenues  which have higher gross margins  comprised a smaller percentage of total revenues 
in pinacor  gross margins on sales to reseller customers decreased due to increased competitive pressures 
in addition  supplier incentive funds were lower as a percentage of total pinacor revenue and net freight expense increased as a percentage of revenue 
the freight expense increase as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price per pound of product shipped as well as an increase in the cost per pound shipped 
microage it services margins increased due to an increase in service revenue  which has higher gross margins than product revenue margins 
this increase was partially offset by lower margins on microage it services product sales to end user customers due to competitive pricing pressures 
future gross profit percentages may be affected by market pressures  the introduction of new company initiatives  changes in revenue mix  future acquisitions  changes in supplier incentive funds  the company s utilization of early payment discount opportunities  supplier pricing actions  and other competitive and economic pressures 
see potential fluctuations in operating results below for information regarding industry trends that may affect future gross profit percentages 
operating expense percentage 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended november   compared to for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in operating expenses was primarily in microage it services and was attributable to acquisitions of reseller locations which generally have higher gross margin and operating expense percentages than the company s other businesses  the costs associated with assimilating these acquisitions  start up costs of several new locations  and the build up of infrastructure associated with microage it services increasing levels of service revenue 
restructuring and other one time charges 
in connection with the restructuring plan discussed above  the company recorded a million charge for the second quarter of fiscal the restructuring and other one time charges included million for employee termination benefits  million for the closing and consolidation of redundant locations  and million for other costs related to the restructuring  primarily one time costs incurred in establishing pinacor and microage it services as separate businesses 
the charges associated with employee termination benefits consist primarily of severance pay for approximately associates 
the reductions occurred in virtually all areas of the company and have been completed 
other expenses net 
other expenses net increased to million for the fiscal year ended november  from million for the fiscal year ended november  this increase was due to higher average daily borrowings  primarily in the first two fiscal quarters of fiscal  to support higher inventory and accounts receivable levels and to increased amortization expense associated with goodwill from acquisitions 
fiscal year ended november  versus fiscal year ended november  the fiscal year ended november  included weeks  while the fiscal year ended november  included weeks 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item total revenue 
total revenue during fiscal was billion 
pinacor revenues totaled billion and microage it services revenues totaled billion 
on a consolidated basis  these revenues were partially offset by eliminations of intercompany revenues of billion 
total revenue increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended november  as compared to the fiscal year ended november  this revenue increase included a million  or  increase in pinacor revenue and a million  or  increase in microage it services revenue  partially offset by an increase in intercompany eliminations 
the increase in revenue was attributable to sales to resellers added since november   increased demand for the company s major suppliers products  improved product availability  the company s addition of new product offerings  the growth of the microcomputer products industry and acquisitions of reseller locations 
gross profit percentage 
the company s gross profit percentage was for the fiscal year ended november  and for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in the company s gross profit percentage results primarily from a higher service content in revenues  which generates higher margins  the growth of the company s integration business  including acquisitions of reseller locations which generally have higher gross margin and operating expense percentages than the company s other business groups  and increasing supplier incentives and early pay discounts 
operating expense percentage 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended november  compared to for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to acquisitions of reseller locations which generally have higher gross margin and operating expense percentages than the company s other business groups and to increased spending in support of electronic commerce initiatives and capacity expansion in personnel  systems and facilities 
other expenses net 
other expenses net increased to million for the fiscal year ended november  from million for the fiscal year ended november  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in average daily borrowings to support higher inventory and accounts receivable levels and to take advantage of early payment discount opportunities 
the early pay discounts are reflected in the company s gross profit 
ups strike impact on earnings per share 
on august   teamsters union members went on strike against united parcel service ups 
the strike lasted days and impacted the company through increased delivery times  increased transportation costs and decreased call center revenue and profit 
because of the brevity of the strike  the higher transportation costs were not passed on by the company to its customers 
the ups strike resulted in approximately a decrease in earnings per share for fiscal supplier incentive funds the key vendors of the company provide various incentives for promoting and marketing their product offerings 
a large portion of the incentives are passed on to the company s customers 
however  a portion of the incentives positively impact the company s income 
beginning in may  the major manufacturers announced and or instituted changes in their sales incentive programs and inventory management programs 
pursuant to these changes  the major manufacturers will i provide price protection for periods ranging from to weeks rather than the unlimited protection previously available  ii allow product returns on average of to of product sales per quarter  rather than the of sales per quarter previously available  and iii provide incentives based on sales of the manufacturers products  rather than on purchases of the products from the manufacturers 
further changes in these incentives could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
potential fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on certain factors  including  but not limited to  demand for the company s information technology products and services  the amount of supplier incentive funds received by the company  the results of acquired businesses  product availability  competitive conditions  new product introductions  changes in customer order patterns and general economic conditions 
in particular  the company s operating results are sensitive to changes in the mix of product and service revenues  product margins  inventory adjustments  and interest rates 
see products and suppliers and competition in part i  item for additional information regarding certain of these factors 
although the company attempts to control its expense levels  these levels are based  in part  on anticipated revenues 
therefore  the company may not be able to control spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  quarterly period to period comparisons of the company s financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  although the company s financial performance has not exhibited significant seasonality in the past  the company and the computer industry in general tend to follow a sales pattern with peaks occurring near the end of the calendar year  due primarily to special vendor promotions and year end business purchases 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its growth and cash needs to date primarily through working capital financing facilities  bank credit lines  common stock offerings and cash generated from operations 
the primary uses of cash have been to fund increases in inventory and accounts receivable resulting from increased sales 
if the company is successful in achieving continued revenue growth  its working capital requirements will continue to increase 
the company has acquired or invested in  and intends to acquire or invest in  resellers to increase core service competencies  expand the company s geographic coverage in key market areas  and strengthen the company s direct relationships with end user customers 
during fiscal  the company completed eight acquisitions 
in addition to cash and other consideration  the company issued  shares of common stock in connection with the acquisitions 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
in addition to these acquisitions  the company made investments in or loans to companies totaling million during fiscal see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for information regarding non cash investment activities 
the company s future acquisitions or investments may be made utilizing cash  stock or a combination of cash and stock 
cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a change in cash provided or used by accounts receivable  inventory  and accounts payable 
during fiscal  million was provided by changes in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable compared to million used by changes in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable during the cash provided in was the result of a decrease in days cost of sales in ending inventory from days at the end of to days at the end of  while days cost of sales in ending accounts payable increased from days to days for the same period 
this was partially offset by an increase in receivables days outstanding from at november  to at november  the increase in receivables days outstanding was due to a decrease in accounts receivable sold to a finance company from million at november  to million at november  the receivables days adjusted for sold receivables were days at november  and days at november  cash used in investing activities increased from million in to million in due to a million increase in purchases of property and equipment as a result of increased spending for electronic commerce initiatives and capacity expansion in systems and facilities  and a million increase in purchases of businesses and investments in unconsolidated companies 
cash used by financing activities was million in compared to cash provided in of million 
the change was primarily due to decreased borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the company maintains three financing agreements the agreements with financing facilities totaling million 
the agreements include an accounts receivable facility the a r facility and inventory financing facilities the inventory facilities 
under the a r facility  the company has the right to sell certain accounts receivable from time to time  on a limited recourse basis  up to an aggregate amount of million sold at any given time 
at november   the net amount of sold accounts receivable was million 
the inventory facilities provide for borrowings up to million 
within the inventory facilities  the company has lines of credit for the purchase of inventory from selected product suppliers inventory lines of credit and a line of credit for general working capital requirements supplemental line of credit 
payments for products purchased under the inventory lines of credit vary depending upon the product supplier  but generally are due between and days from the date of the advance 
amounts borrowed under the supplemental line of credit may remain outstanding until the expiration date of the agreements august 
no interest or finance charges are payable on the inventory lines of credit if payments are made when due 
at november   the company had million outstanding under the inventory lines of credit included in accounts payable in the accompanying balance sheets  and nothing outstanding under the supplemental line of credit 
of the million of financing capacity represented by the agreements  million was unused as of november  utilization of the unused portion is dependent upon the company s collateral availability at the time the funds would be needed 
borrowings under the agreements are secured by substantially all of the company s assets  and the agreements contain certain restrictive covenants  including tangible net worth requirements and ratios of debt to tangible net worth and current assets to current liabilities 
at november   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
in addition to the financing facilities discussed above  the company maintains an accounts receivable purchase agreement the purchase agreement with a commercial credit corporation the buyer whereby the buyer agrees to purchase  from time to time at its option  on a limited recourse basis  certain accounts receivable of the company 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  no finance charges are assessed if the accounts are settled within forty days 
at november   the net amount of sold accounts receivable under the purchase agreement was million 
the company also maintains trade credit arrangements with its suppliers and other creditors to finance product purchases 
a few major suppliers maintain security interests in their products sold to the company 
several of the company s major suppliers have announced their intention to change the terms within their credit arrangements with the company 
these changes include a decrease in the number of days the company has to pay for product purchases and a decrease in the amount of reseller purchases from the company that the suppliers are willing to subsidize 
these changes  when implemented  will increase the company s working capital requirements and will increase the company s financing costs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to borrow adequate amounts on terms acceptable to the company 
the unavailability of a significant portion of  or the loss of  the agreements or trade credit from suppliers would have a material adverse effect on the company 
although the company has no material capital commitments  the company expects to make capital expenditures of approximately to million in the next fiscal year 
inflation the company believes that inflation has generally not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date 
year readiness disclosure the term year problem is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other equipment as the year approaches and is reached 
these problems generally arise from the fact that computers and equipment have historically used two digit fields that recognize dates using the assumption that the first two digits are on january   systems using two digit date fields could recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the company started a year awareness campaign in in  a year team was formed to address the company s year issues 
in connection with this effort  the company inventoried all critical systems with year implications 
the company then assessed whether inventoried items were year ready 
the inventory and assessment phases are both complete for all mission critical systems 
the final step involves remediation of those systems that are not year ready 
the company estimates that the remediation process is complete  and the few remaining mission critical systems that are not ready are planned to be upgraded to a new vendor release  replaced  or retired in the first half of the company also has surveyed its stocking manufacturers and obtained the manufacturer s year readiness statements or warranty  where available 
a database has been implemented to track this supplier information 
currently  a substantial majority of stocking manufacturers have stated that their currently available products are capable of processing date sensitive information in the year and beyond 
manufacturers are using various forms of terminology when referring to their product s year status  such as ready  compliant  or capable 
the definitions are not consistent and do not guarantee that when the products are interfaced they will operate as represented by the manufacturer 
the company is a distributor and integrator of computer systems  not a manufacturer 
therefore  and generally  the company does not provide any additional warranty or certification and does not assume any liability in the event the product does not perform according to the supplier s warranty or statement 
with respect to external parties that provide critical goods and services to the company  including utility companies  telecommunication service companies  shipping companies  and other service providers outside the company s control  the company is seeking assurances  either through formal communications or otherwise  that such parties will be year ready 
the company estimates that it has spent million upgrading its computer systems to be year ready 
the future anticipated cost to finish implementing year readiness is projected to be less than million 
these estimates include only such expenditures for converting the company s mainframe and modifications to desktops and applications that directly interface with the mainframe unit to be year ready and exclude other expenses incurred for regularly scheduled updates that would have been undertaken regardless of the year problem  but result in a system being year ready 
none of these upgrades were accelerated by the need to make certain systems year ready 
despite the efforts of the company to become year ready  no assurance can be given that the company s computer systems will be year compliant in a timely manner or that the company will not incur significant additional expenses pursuing year compliance 
moreover  even if the company s systems are year compliant  there can be no assurance that the company will not be adversely affected by the failure of others to become year compliant or by the failure of the company s suppliers to provide year compliant products for resale by the company 
the company believes that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario is the failure of a third party to achieve year compliance 
such a failure could result in  for example  the inability of the company to ship product  a telecommunications failure at one or more of the company s facilities  a decrease in customer orders  delays in product deliveries from vendors  or power outages at one or more of the company s facilities 
the company s year readiness effort is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year compliance and readiness of material external third parties 
the company believes that  with the completion of its year readiness effort as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal business operations should be minimized 
the company is in the process of developing a contingency plan for the year problem 
it is anticipated that this plan will be complete by the middle of the plan includes the evaluation of potential disruptions in business operations and plans for emergency power sources  manual procedures  remediation of systems scheduled to be replaced  or other viable alternatives
