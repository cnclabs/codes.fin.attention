the discussions throughout this document are based on the management structure that existed at the end of the year 
the board of directors has declared a dividend distribution of preferred shares purchase rights to shareholders of record on march  the rights are designed to protect and maximize the value of your interest in the company 
we believe that the rights plan  while not intending to prevent a takeover  will provide protection to you  our shareholders  from the abusive and coercive tactics that often occur in takeover attempts 
the rights contain provisions to protect shareholders in the event of an unsolicited takeover attempt through such methods as a gradual accumulation of shares in of or more of the outstanding stock followed by a two tier tender offer or other tactics that do not treat all shareholders equally 
these tactics may unfairly pressure shareholders  deprive them of the full value of their shares  or squeeze them out of their investment without giving them any real choice 
with over  companies having established rights plans to protect shareholders  we consider the rights plan to be the best available means of protecting the full value of your investment in the company  while not preventing a fair acquisition offer for the company 
the rights will initially trade with shares of the company s common stock and have no impact on the way in which you can presently trade the company s shares 
as explained in detail in the attached summary of rights  the rights are not exercisable until ten days after a person or group announces acquisition of or more of the company s outstanding common stock or the commencement of a tender offer which would result in ownership of the person or group of or more of the outstanding stock 
during fiscal year  and effective as of the company s fiscal year end  the company changed from a calendar fiscal year end and adopted a week fiscal year ending on the friday nearest to december  which for fiscal was january  the company does not expect the effects of any differences due to the change of fiscal years to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company has not restated or adjusted its prior financial statements on this new fiscal year basis 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
results of continuing operations in  the company s annual revenues from continuing operations increased slightly to million from million in in  the company had a net loss from continuing operations of million  or diluted loss per share  compared to net income from continuing operations of million  or diluted earnings per share  in the total net loss for fiscal  including discontinued operations  was million  or diluted loss per share

the following table breaks out the company s revenues by industry market january  total january  total december  total revenue revenue revenue in thousands precision positioning group    mobile and timing technologies    total revenue    precision positioning group the precision positioning group revenues had a growth rate of in over the increase compared to is primarily from revenues in the land surveying  marine surveying  mapping and gis systems  and mining  construction  and agriculture markets 
the increase in land surveying was due to the continued strong customer acceptance of the company s gps total station and products 
also  the increase in marine survey  mapping and gis and mining  construction and agriculture reflects increased demand for these products 
in the fourth quarter of  the fcc suspended the processing of certain real time kinematic product line license applications pending a resolution of certain frequency interference issues which it has reviewed with the company 
the fcc has recently reinstated the processing of these license applications  based upon the company providing certain upgrades at its cost to purchasers of earlier products  making certain product modifications intended to decrease the likelihood of any radio frequency interference and providing guidance to users of its equipment in avoiding the interference with these users of the frequency spectrum and the agreement to help teach customers to be good radio citizens 
the precision positioning group revenues had a growth rate of in over the increase  compared to  was primarily in mapping and gis systems  as well as mining  agriculture and construction markets 
the increase in mapping and gis systems market came from strong sales of the pathfinder product line  and mining  construction  and agriculture products continued to grow from mobile and timing technologies the mobile and timing technologies revenues decreased in from the decrease is primarily in automotive  commercial air transport and military aerospace systems 
the softness in the automotive market was due to the financial difficulties of a major customer and a delay in new product introductions 
the commercial air transport decrease was due to less than anticipated demand from honeywell and the military aerospace system decrease was due to the large dollar shipment on the cugr contract in the fourth quarter of  which was not repeated in military sales are highly dependent on contracts that are subject to government approval and are  therefore  expected to continue to fluctuate from period to period 
the company believes that opportunities in this market have been substantially reduced by cutbacks in us and foreign military spending 
the mobile and timing technologies revenues had a growth rate of in over the increase was primarily in the mobile positioning  commercial air transport  and military aerospace systems 
the mobile and timing technologies increase in was due primarily to the company recognizing million in revenues from a development agreement in connection with an irrevocable nonrefundable  nonrecurring engineering fee recorded in the third quarter of and a nonrecurring one time million technology license fee recorded in the second quarter of from pioneer electronic corporation in connection with expansion of its prior license for in car navigation 
mobile and timing technologies revenues also increased in compared to due to the resumption of shipments in to american mobile satellite corporation amsc  a company based in reston  virginia  that provides a variety of voice and data services via satellite 
in march  the company signed a large contract for the supply of galaxy gps land mobile satellite terminals to amsc 
late in  amsc requested that the company cease delivery  due in part to delays in amsc s completion of software 
shipments under the original contract were halted in the fourth quarter of  and the contract was amended 
mobile and timing technologies revenues in included  in sales to amsc 
a total of  for product revenues shutdown fees and contract renegotiation fees was recognized in the increase in commercial air transport and military aerospace systems in from was primarily due to shipments to the government under the cugr program  as well as strong sales for the honeywell trimble product ht and strong sales for military aerospace products 
export sales export sales from domestic operations  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  in  and in sales to unaffiliated customers in foreign locations  as a percentage of total revenue  were in  in  and in the company anticipates that export revenue and sales made by its subsidiaries in locations outside the us will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue 
for this reason  the company is subject to the risks inherent in these sales  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  governmental approval  and tariffs or other barriers 
even though the us government announced on march   that it would support and maintain the gps system  as well as eliminate the use of selective availability s a a method of degrading gps accuracy  there may be a reluctance in certain foreign markets to purchase products based on gps technology  given the control of gps by the us government 
the company s results of operations could be adversely affected if the company were unable to continue to generate significant sales in locations outside the us no single customer  including the us government and its agencies  accounted for or more of the company s total revenues in  or it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by the company may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin 
gross margin varies due to a number of factors  including product mix  domestic versus international sales  customer type  the effects of production volumes and fixed manufacturing costs on unit product costs  and new product start up costs 
in  the gross margin percentage on product sales was  compared with in and in the decrease in the gross margin percentages primarily reflects increased labor costs from new product introductions  expediting fees  inventory write downs  and unabsorbed fixed overhead due to lower than expected volumes 
the margins were enhanced by the positive impact of nonproduct revenues of million recognized from pioneer electronic corporation and from a development agreement in connection with an irrevocable nonrefundable  nonrecurring engineering fee of million 
in  the company also recorded nonrecurring fees from amsc of million  however  there can be no assurance that similar items will recur in the future 
in addition  because of product mix changes within and among the industry markets  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs  and other factors  positive future gross margins cannot be assured 
while precision positioning segment products have the highest gross margins of all the company s products  their margins have decreased  primarily in response to competition 
the company expects competition to increase in its precision positioning segment  and it is therefore likely that further price erosion will occur  with consequent lower gross margin percentages 
the company expects that in the future a higher percentage of its business will be conducted through alliances with strategic partners such as honeywell and caterpillar 
as a result of volume pricing and the assumption of certain operating costs by the partner  margins on this business are likely to be lower than sales directly to end users 
operating expenses 
the following table shows operating expenses for the periods indicated 
it should be read in conjunction with the narrative descriptions of those operating expenses below january  january  december  years ended in thousands research and development    sales and marketing    general and administrative    restructuring charges   total    research and development 
research and development spending increased in absolute dollars during  representing of revenue  compared with in and in the higher research and development expenses in are due to the company receiving fewer funds from cost reimbursement projects in as compared with the dollar increase from to is due primarily to an increase in personnel and the related expenses that accompany such an increase in the number of employees 
there was also an increase in the number of specialized engineering consultants and temporary employees 
the increase in research and development is part of the company s continuing aggressive development of future products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased during  representing of revenue  compared with in and in the primary reason for the dollar and percentage increases in expenses from to is an increase in personnel and related expenses  that accompany an increase in the number of employees 
in addition  the company experienced increases in expenses related to trade shows  advertising  and demo equipment expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense in compared to was due to a decrease in personnel because of the company s restructuring activities and advertising costs 
the company s future growth will depend in part on the timely development and continued viability of the markets in which the company currently competes  and on the company s ability to continue to identify and exploit new markets for its products 
in addition  the company has encountered significant competition in selected markets  and expects such competition to intensify as the market for gps applications receives acceptance 
several of the company s competitors are major corporations with substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and manufacturing resources 
increased competition may result in reduced market share and is likely to result in price reductions of gps based products  which could adversely affect the company s revenues and profitability 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased during  representing of revenue  compared with in  they remained flat as a percentage of revenue compared to at 
the increase from to is due primarily to an increase in personnel and the related expenses  that accompany an increase in the number of employees and consultants  as well as an increase in outside services related to legal fees associated with certain litigation matters during the decrease from in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to decreases in outside services related to legal fees associated with certain arbitration and litigation matters during restructuring charges 
as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements during the year ended january   the company recorded a restructuring charge of million classified in operating expenses 
these charges are a result of the company s reorganization to improve business processes and to decrease organizational redundancies  to improve management accountability and to improve the company s focus on profitable operations 
as a result of the reorganization  the company has downsized its operations  including reducing headcount and facilities space usage  and canceled its enterprise wide information system project and certain research and development projects 
the impact of these decisions is that significant amounts of the company s fixed assets  prepaid expenses  and purchased technology have been impaired and certain liabilities incurred 
the company has written down the related assets to their net realizable values and made provisions for the estimated liabilities 
the elements of the charges in and the amounts remaining at january   on the balance sheet are as follows in thousands remaining in total amounts paid accrued liabilites charged to written off as of expense in january  employee termination benefits    facility space reductions   enterprise wide information system abandonment    subtotal    the cash expenditures associated with the remaining obligations will occur primarily in fiscal nonoperating income expense  net 
nonoperating income expense  net  includes interest income and expense  as well as gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign exchange gains were  in and  compared with a loss of  in the company s policy is to hedge its exposure to foreign currency transactions to minimize the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on consolidated results of operations 
gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward contracts offset gains and losses resulting from the underlying hedged transactions 
interest income decreased both in from and in from because of lower interest income received on cash and short term investments due to lower average balances for the year over the prior year 
interest expense decreased slightly in due to lower fees on unused lines of credit 
interest expense includes interest on a million note issued in august  and fees on unused lines of credit 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details of long term debt and lines of credit 
income tax provision 
the company s effective tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal years  and are  and  respectively 
the and income tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of due to foreign taxes and the inability to realize the benefits of the net operating losses 
the income tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the realization of previously reserved deferred tax assets 
inflation 
the effects of inflation on the company s financial results have not been significant to date 
litigation the company is involved in a number of legal matters as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
while the company does not expect to suffer significant adverse effects from these litigation matters or from unasserted claims  the nature of litigation is unpredictable and there can be no assurance that it will not do so 
liquidity and capital resources at january   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments have been reduced from the prior year  due primarily to the company s stock repurchase program see additional information below and acquisitions of capital equipment 
the company s long term debt consisted primarily of a million note obligation due in  and the company had no debt outstanding under its  unsecured line of credit 
the company has an amount of  outstanding under a separate  line of credit 
the company has relied primarily on cash provided by operating and financing activities and net sales of short term investments to fund capital expenditures  the repurchase of the company s common stock see further explanation below  and other investing activities 
management believes that its cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  together with its existing credit line  will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
in  the cash provided in operating activities was million  as compared to cash used of million in the corresponding period in cash provided by operating activities in arose from decreases in accounts receivable and inventories and increases in accrued liabilities offset by the company s net loss net of non cash charges 
inventory related to continuing operations as of january   decreased by million from the year end levels  primarily due to a focused effort by the company to reduce inventory by supply chain synchronization  reduce lead and cycle times  simplifying product lines  and implementing tighter control over the material forecasting process 
the company s ability to continue to generate cash from operations will depend in large part on revenues  the rate of collections of accounts receivable  and management of inventory levels 
cash provided by sales of common stock in represents the proceeds from purchases made pursuant to the company s stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan  and totaled million for the year ending january  in august  the company entered into a three year  unsecured revolving credit facility with four banks the credit agreement 
this credit facility replaced the previous two year  unsecured line that expired in august the credit agreement enables the company to borrow up to  provided that certain financial and other covenants are met 
under a separate agreement  the company has an additional  line of credit provided only by the lead bank under the credit agreement for letter of credit purposes  and this is also subject to the covenants in the main facility 
the credit agreement provides for payment of a commitment fee of and borrowings to bear interest at over libor if the total funded debt to ebitda is less than or equal to times  and borrowings to bear interest at over libor if the ratio is greater than times and less than or equal to times  or and borrowings to bear interest at over libor if the ratio is greater than times 
in addition to borrowing at the specified libor rate  the company has the right to borrow with interest at the higher of i one of the bank s annual prime rate and ii the federal funds rate plus 
to date  the company has not made any borrowings under the lines 
the company is restricted from paying dividends under the terms of the credit agreement 
as of october   the agent and lenders of the  unsecured revolving credit facility granted a limited waiver of the company s compliance with various loan covenants as of october   until december  the agent and lenders granted a second limited waiver an extension of the first limited waiver for the company s compliance with various loan covenants which extended from january   until february  as of february   the company  the agent and the lenders agreed to new covenants which will be tested by a compliance document as of april   and for the life of the loan which expires in august of the  revolving credit facility was modified to include the  line of credit for letter of credit purposes to simplify the entire arrangement  as less than  was being utilized under the separate facility as of january  to date  the company has not made any borrowings under the  revolving credit facility 
the company announced in february that it had approved a discretionary program whereby up to  shares of its common stock could be repurchased on the open market by the company to offset the potential dilutive effects to earnings loss per share from the issuance of additional stock options 
in  the company approved the repurchase of an additional million shares under the discretionary program 
the company intends to use existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to finance any such stock repurchases under this program 
during  the company purchased  shares at a cost of million 
during  the company purchased  shares at a cost of million 
during  the company purchased million shares at a cost of million 
the company presently expects capital expenditures to be approximately million  primarily for computer equipment  software  and leasehold improvements associated with business expansion 
the company is continually evaluating potential external investments in technologies related to its business and  to date  has made relatively small strategic investments in a number of gps related technology companies 
there can be no assurance that any such outside investments made to date  or that any potential future investments  will be successful 
the company has evaluated the issues raised by the introduction of the single european currency euro for initial implementation as of january   and during the transition period through january  the company does not currently believe that the introduction of the euro will have a material effect on the company s foreign exchange and hedging activities 
the company has also assessed the potential impact the euro conversion will have in regard to its internal systems accommodating euro denominated transactions 
the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro introduction over time  based on currently available information 
the company does not currently anticipate any adverse impact of the euro conversion on the company 
year and gps week number rollover issues computers and software  as well as other equipment that relies on only two digits to identify or represent a year  may be unable to accurately process or display certain information at or after the year this is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the year issue may materially affect  trimble s vendors  suppliers  internal systems  products and customers 
the company continues to address the year issue to avoid what might otherwise be a material and adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
another date related issue  known as the gps week number roll over or wnro issue  could also materially affect various trimble products 
the wnro issue is unrelated to the year issue and is unique to gps technology 
all gps satellites  which are operated by the us government  broadcast time in the form of a gps week number and a time offset into each gps week 
week numbers range from to week started on january   and week will end on august   at which time the week number broadcast by all us gps satellites will roll over  back to among other potential effects  this rollover may cause gps receivers and software that process data obtained by gps receivers to erroneously interpret high week number  pre wnro data as post dating later low week number  post wnro data 
this may cause satellite positions to be miscalculated and produce gross position fix errors 
receivers that process and display calendar dates based on weeks since may generate date calculation errors 
the company continues to address the wnro issue to avoid what might otherwise be a material and adverse effect on the company s future consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company continues to assess the potential impact of both the year and wnro issues on its vendors  suppliers  internal systems  products  and customers and has begun  and in many cases completed  corrective efforts in these areas 
year remediation plan the company s board of directors has adopted a comprehensive year remediation plan  the goal of which is to minimize business disruptions and risk exposure that might otherwise arise as a consequence of moving into the twenty first century 
the plan focuses on achieving year readiness across the company s entire supply chain  and is designed to deal with the most critical systems first 
additionally  the company s year remediation plan calls for the development of contingency plans to address potential problem areas with internal systems  and with suppliers and other third parties 
to these ends  a yk program management office has been established to manage and coordinate implementation of the plan on a companywide basis 
it is expected that assessment  remediation  and contingency planning activities will be ongoing throughout  with the objective of appropriately resolving all material year issues before the st century rollover 
information technology and other systems the company continues to assess the potential impact of the year issue on its internal systems  including information technology it and non it systems  and has begun corrective efforts in this area  as follows o the company has a plan to upgrade its existing mrp erp information systems to be year compliant 
o assessment and remediation efforts in connection with the company s other it and non it systems will be undertaken as part of the company s general yk remediation plan 
the company currently plans to complete renovation  testing and implementation of critical systems  or successful execution of contingency plans  during the third quarter of there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  such renovation  testing  implementation or execution  and the company s inability to successfully and timely complete these tasks could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations or financial condition 
products to address and minimize the anticipated impact of both the year issue and the wnro issue on the company s products  the company continues to assess the anticipated impact these issues may have on the performance of its products  and to resolve various related performance problems of its current products 
in addition  the company has adopted a formal year and gps week number rollover policy to o publish year and wnro related product performance information on the company s public web site  o respond to individual customer inquiries regarding the anticipated performance of particular company products  o furnish upgrades to customers whose trimble products are upgradable  and o provide information regarding available product alternatives to customers with noncompliant products 
assessment of products  resolution of certain products year and wnro performance problems  and implementation of the company s year and gps week number rollover policy  are ongoing  and as to many company products is complete 
the company does not anticipate that the year and wnro issues will have a material adverse effect on sales of its products 
the company has incurred and will continue to incur  through and thereafter increased expenses associated with year and wnro related product assessment and resolution of certain products year and wnro performance problems  implementation of the company s year and gps week number rollover policy  and fulfillment of year and wnro related customer support and warranty obligations  in amounts that management believes has not had and will not have a material adverse effect on the company s historical or future results of operations or financial condition 
vendors and suppliers for its successful operation  the company materially relies on goods and services purchased from certain vendors 
if these vendors fail to adequately address the year issue such that their delivery of goods and services to the company is materially impaired  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial results 
the company is preparing to survey its principal vendors to assess the effect the year issue will have on their ability to supply their goods and services without material interruption  and at this time the company cannot determine or predict the outcome of this effort 
contingency plans will be developed and executed with respect to vendors who will not be year ready in a timely manner where such lack of readiness is expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
however  because the company cannot be certain that its vendors will be able to supply goods and services without material interruption  and because the company cannot be certain that execution of its contingency plans will be capable of implementation or will result in a continuous and adequate supply of such goods and services  the company can give no assurance that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
customers the company has material relationships with certain customers 
if those customers fail to achieve an adequate state of year readiness in their own operations  or if their year readiness efforts consume significant resources  their ability to purchase the company s products may be impaired 
this could adversely affect demand for the company s products and  therefore  the company s future revenues 
the company plans to assess the effect the year issue will have on its principal customers  and at this time cannot determine the impact it will have 
related costs to the company the company currently expects that the total cost of year remediation efforts will not exceed approximately million 
the company has been and will be expensing these costs as incurred 
the total cost estimate does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims or the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
the total cost estimate is based on the current assessment of the projects  and is subject to change as the projects progress 
overall impact on the company at the present time  and subject to the cost estimates above  management does not believe that the year issue and wnro matters discussed above will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or overall trends in results of operation 
however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters  therefore  there can be no assurance that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
certain other risk factors the company s revenue has tended to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to the timing of shipments of products under contracts and the sale of licenses 
a significant portion of quarterly revenues occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of a quarter 
if orders are not received  or if shipments were to be delayed a few days at the end of a quarter  the operating results and reported earnings per share for that quarter could be significantly impacted 
future revenues are difficult to predict  and projections are based primarily on historical models  which are not necessarily accurate representations of the future 
the company has a relatively fixed cost structure in the short term  and it is determined by the business plans and strategies the company intends to implement in the two segments it addresses 
this effective leveraging means that increases or decreases in revenues have more than a proportional impact on net income or losses 
the company estimates that a change in product revenue of million would change earnings per share by to cents 
the mobile and timing technologies business unit relies on high volumes and relatively low margin sales 
mobile and timing technologies customers are extremely price sensitive 
as costs decrease through technological advances  these advances are typically passed on to the customer 
to compete  mobile and timing technologies requires high volume production and manufacturing techniques 
customers expect high quality standards with very low defect rates 
compared to competitors  which have far greater resources in such high volume manufacturing and associated support activities  the company is relatively inexperienced 
the company s stock price is subject to significant volatility 
if revenues and or earnings fail to meet the expectations of the investment community  there could be an immediate and significant impact on the trading price of the company s stock 
the value of the company s products relies substantially on its technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings 
the company recognizes that as new patents are issued or are brought to the company s attention by the holders of such patents  it may be necessary for the company to withdraw products from the market  take a license from such patent holders  or redesign its products 
the company does not believe that any of its products infringe any valid claim of any patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  but cannot be certain that they do not do so 
in addition  the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations 
such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues or profitability 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is continuously evaluating alliances and external investments in technologies related to its business  and has already entered into alliances and made relatively small investments in a number of gps related technology companies 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products and alliances entail numerous risks  including i the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies  economies of scale  or other value  ii diversion of management s attention  and iii loss of key employees of acquired operations 
any such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
no assurances can be given that the company will not incur problems from current or future alliances  acquisitions  or investments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will realize value from any such alliances  acquisitions  or investments 
certain risks are inherent in making the types of changes in senior management that occurred during the third fiscal quarter of while the company intends to name permanent replacements for such positions as soon as practicable  there can be no assurance that such changes in senior management and related uncertainties will not adversely affect the company s consolidated operating results and financial condition 
the ability of the company to maintain its competitive technological position will depend  in a large part  on its ability to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified development and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified employees in the company s industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  motivate and retain enough qualified employees necessary for the future continued development of the company s business and products 
the company has certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold 
for example  faa certification is required for all aviation products 
also  the company s products that use integrated radio communication technology require an end user to obtain licensing from the federal communications commission fcc for frequency band usage 
during the fourth quarter of  the fcc temporarily suspended the issuance of licenses for certain of the company s real time kinematic products because of interference with certain other users of similar radio frequencies 
an inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or fcc s delays could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company s gps technology is dependent on the use of radio spectrums 
the assignment of the spectrums is controlled by a worldwide organization  the international telecomunications union itu 
any reallocation of the radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on the company s operating results 
under the terms of the company s subordinated promissory notes  the company is required to meet a minimum consolidated net worth requirement 
the company is in the process of obtaining a reduction of this minimum requirement 
if the company is not successful in obtaining a reduction in the minimum consolidated net worth requirement and net worth falls below the minimum required level  the company would be in default of its loan covenants 
such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and liquidity 
information with respect to gps navstar satellite system is included in part i of this report  under the caption background  paragraph new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the standard will require the company to record all derivatives held on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income until the value related to the ineffective portion of a hedge  if any  will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the company expects to adopt sfas as of the beginning of its fiscal year the effect of adopting the standard is currently being evaluated  but is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

market interest rate risk short term investments owned by the company 
as of january   the company had short term investments of million 
these short term investments consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase between three and twelve months 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates from levels at january   would cause the fair value of these short term investments to decline by an immaterial amount 
because the company has the ability to hold these investments until maturity the company would not expect the value of these investments to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce the company s interest income 
outstanding debt of the company

the interest rate of this instrument is fixed 
however  a hypothetical percent decrease in the interest rates would not have a material impact on the company

foreign currency exchange rate risk the company hedges risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
the company utilizes forward contracts to hedge trade and intercompany receivables and payables 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements  as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the hedge contracts 
all hedge instruments are marked to market through earnings every period 
the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position utilizing the current hedging strategy 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year  and the company does not defer any gains and losses  as they are all accounted for through earnings every period
