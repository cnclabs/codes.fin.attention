from its introduction in the second quarter of through the second quarter of  the company s winview product represented the largest source of the company s revenues 
the company began shipping its winframe product in final form in the third quarter of and metaframe in the second quarter of  and these products  together with their related options  have comprised the largest source of the company s revenue 
on may   the company and microsoft entered into a license  development and marketing agreement  as amended the development agreement  which provides for the licensing to microsoft of certain of the company s multi user software enhancements to microsoft s windows nt server and for the cooperation between the parties for the development of certain future multi user versions of microsoft windows nt server  terminal server edition nt terminal server 
the development agreement also provides for each party to develop its own enhancements to the jointly developed products which may provide access to nt terminal server base platform from a wide variety of computing devices 
in june  the company released its metaframe product  a company developed enhancement that implements the independent computing architecture ica on nt terminal server  which provides nt terminal server with capabilities similar to those currently offered in the winframe product line 
pursuant to the terms of the development agreement  in may  the company received an aggregate of million as a non refundable royalty payment and for engineering and support services to be rendered by the company 
under the terms of the development agreement  the company is entitled to receive payments of an additional million  in quarterly payments  a portion of which has already been received 
in addition  microsoft and the company have agreed to engage in certain joint marketing efforts to promote use of windows nt server based multi user software and the company s ica protocol 
additionally  subject to the terms of the development agreement  microsoft has agreed to endorse only the company s ica protocol as the preferred way to provide multi user windows access for devices other than windows client devices until at least november and the company shall be entitled to license its winframe technology based on windows nt until at least september  as a result of the development agreement  the company will continue to support the microsoft windows nt platform  but the metaframe products and later releases will no longer incorporate windows nt technology 
the company plans to continue developing enhancements to its metaframe product line and expects that this product  winframe products and associated options and royalties derived under the terms of the development agreement will constitute a majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
revenue is recognized when earned 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop as amended by sop  software revenue recognition for and statement of position  software revenue recognition for and product revenues are recognized upon shipment of the software product only if no significant company obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
the initial fee of million relating to the development agreement is being recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is five years 
the additional million due pursuant to the development agreement  as amended  is being recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract  effective april in the case of non cancelable product licensing arrangements under which certain original equipment manufacturers oems have software reproduction rights  initial recognition of revenue also requires delivery and customer acceptance of the product master or first copy

non recurring engineering fees are recognized ratably as the work is performed 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services are performed 
service and subscription revenues from customer maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product updates and upgrades are based on the price charged or derived value of the undelivered elements and are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically twelve months 
service revenues  which are immaterial when compared to net revenues  are included in net revenues on the face of the statement of income 
the company has acquired and licensed technology related to its strategic objectives 
on october   the company completed its acquisition of certain of the assets  technology and operations of datapac australasia pty limited for approximately million in cash 
in january  the company licensed certain software technology from epicon  inc  for approximately million payable in cash 
on february   the company completed its acquisition of certain of the assets  technology and operations of insignia solutions  plc for approximately million in cash 
on june   the company acquired all of the outstanding securities of apm limited  the parent company of digitivity inc  for approximately million in cash 
in july  the company completed its acquisition of certain technologies of vdonet corporation ltd 
for approximately million in cash 
these acquisitions and licensing arrangement were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for business combinations 
the company allocated the cost of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values using valuation methods believed to be appropriate at the time 
the acquired intangible assets included in process technology projects  among other assets  which were related to research and development that had not reached technological feasibility and for which there was no alternative future use 
as a result of the securities and exchange commission staff s letter to the american institute of certified public accountants dated september  regarding its views on in process research and development ipr d write offs  the company revised its calculations of the value of the acquired in process technology based on adjusted after tax cash flows and reduced the amount of the write offs for purchased ipr d to million  million and million related to the insignia  apm and vdonet acquisitions  respectively  and million related to the licensing agreement with epicon 
these reductions have been reallocated to other intangible assets 
after giving effect to the re evaluation  the company recorded amortization of intangible assets of million and  and write offs of ipr d of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements

net revenues 
the company s net revenues during  and were derived primarily from product license revenues 
the increase in net revenues in is primarily attributable to an increase in unit sales of the company s new metaframe product  which was first shipped in june  and increases in unit sales of system options products 
system options products include additional user licenses as well as other options  which are applicable to both the winframe and metaframe product lines 
to a lesser extent  the increase in net revenues in was attributable to an increase in unit sales of winframe and an increase in revenue related to the development agreement with microsoft 
the increase in net revenues in primarily reflects revenues generated from the company s winframe products  and to a lesser extent  increased volume in licensing of oem products  as well as the initial recognition of revenue related to the development agreement with microsoft 
these increases in net revenues during were partially offset by a decline in the company s winview product revenues and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the company s provision for stock rotation of the previous version of winframe and product returns 
an analysis of company net revenue is detailed in the table below 
net revenue is segregated into five main categories winframe based products  metaframe based products  system options products  oem revenue  microsoft royalties and other revenue 
the oem revenue consists of license fees and royalties from third party manufacturers who are granted a license to incorporate and or market the company s multi user technologies in their own product offerings 
the company s winframe  metaframe and oem revenues represent product license fees based upon the company s multi user nt based technology 
microsoft royalties represent fees recognized in connection with the development agreement 
year ended december  revenue revenue growth growth to to winframe based products metaframe based products system options products oem revenue microsoft royalties other revenue net revenues not meaningful 
international 
international revenues sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  and are expected to account for a larger percentage of revenue in see note to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this annual report 
the company will continue investing in international markets and expanding its international operations by establishing additional foreign operations  hiring personnel  expanding its international sales force and adding third party channel partners 
international revenues may fluctuate in future periods as a result of difficulties in staffing  dependence on an independent distribution channel  competition  variability of foreign economic and political conditions and changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  localized product release timing and marketing such products in foreign countries 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consisted primarily of the cost of royalties  product media and duplication  manuals  packaging materials and shipping expense 
cost of oem revenues included in cost of revenues primarily consisted of cost of royalties  except where the oem elected to purchase shrink wrapped products  in which case such costs were as described in the previous sentence 
all development costs incurred in connection with the development agreement are expensed as incurred as a separate component of cost of revenues 
all development costs included in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred except for certain intangible assets related to the acquisitions and licensing arrangement described herein 
gross margin 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of gross revenues from to was primarily attributable to the introduction of the metaframe product line which has a relatively high gross margin contribution  as it bears no royalty  compared to the winframe product line 
in the third quarter of  the company began shipping winframe version  which had a higher gross margin than the previous winframe version  due to lower royalty fees and fewer components 
the overall increase in gross margin was partially offset by gross margin contribution related to the development agreement revenue  which has a lower gross margin as a percentage of net revenue 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of gross revenues from to was primarily attributable to changes in product mix  representing changes in the mix of oem revenues versus product sold to distributors and resellers  and different products within the winframe product line  which were partially offset by the gross margin related to the development agreement revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs 
to date  all internal software development costs have been expensed as incurred 
increases in research and development expenses in and resulted primarily from additional staffing  associated salaries and related expenses required to expand and enhance the company s product lines 
additionally  in  research and development expenses increased as a result of third party expenses associated with the translation and localization of the metaframe and winframe products  as well as increased expenses associated with the company s software products and technology 
in and  these costs were partially offset by the allocation of certain research and development expenses to cost of revenues for the portion of these expenses associated with the development agreement revenues 
sales  marketing and support expenses 
increases in sales  marketing and support expenses in resulted  in part  from increases in sales  marketing and support staff and associated salaries  commissions and related expenses 
increases in sales  marketing and support expenses in and resulted primarily from increases in promotional and advertising activities  which include co op advertising programs and other promotional activities such as those directed at resellers  training programs  trade shows and other direct mail and advertising activities 
additionally  sales and marketing staff and associated salaries  commissions and related expenses  also increased 
such increases in sales  marketing and support expenses resulted from efforts to expand product specific marketing programs  such as the metaframe launch in  and increased efforts to expand the company s product distribution channels in general and administrative expenses 
increases in general and administrative expenses in and resulted primarily from increased staff  associated salaries and related expenses necessary to support overall increases in the scope of the company s operations  and in  increased legal fees due to contract negotiations and litigation defense as well as an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts due to an increased level of accounts receivable attributable to each period s respective increase in sales 
amortization of intangible assets 
the increase in amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in is due to the insignia  apm and vdonet acquisitions and epicon licensing arrangement 
as of december   the company had net goodwill of million associated with these transactions remaining to be amortized over four years following the acquisitions 
in addition  the company had other net identifiable intangible assets of million associated with the acquisitions and licensing arrangement remaining to be amortized over three to four years  as applicable 
see in process research and development 
in process research and development 
during  the company completed the acquisition and licensing of certain in process software technologies in which it allocated a portion of the purchase price to ipr d 
the company allocated million  million and million for ipr d related to the insignia  apm and vdonet acquisitions  respectively  and million for ipr d related to the licensing agreement with epicon  after giving effect to the re evaluation  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and overview 
since the respective dates of acquisition and licensing  the company has used the acquired in process technology to develop new product offerings and enhancements  which have or will become part of the company s suite of products when completed 
functionality included in products using the acquired in process technology have been introduced at various times following the respective transaction dates of the acquired assets and licensing  and the company currently expects to complete the development of the remaining projects at various dates between and upon completion  the company has offered and intends to offer the related products to its customers 
the nature of the efforts required to develop and integrate the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products or features and functionalities within the citrix suite of existing products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the company currently expects that products utilizing the acquired in process technology will be successfully developed  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of any of these products will be achieved 
furthermore  future developments in the software industry  particularly the server based computing environment  changes in technology  changes in other products and offerings or other developments may cause the company to alter or abandon product plans 
failure to complete the development of these projects in their entirety  or in a timely manner  could have a material  adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired in process research and development will not deviate from the projections used to value such technology in connection with each of the respective acquisitions 
ongoing operations and financial results for acquired assets and licensed technology  and the company as a whole  are subject to a variety of factors which may not have been known or estimable at the date of such transaction  and the estimates discussed below should not be considered the company s current projections for operating results for the acquired assets or licensed technology or the company as a whole 
the fair value of the in process technology in each acquisition was based on analyses of the markets  projected cash flows and risks associated with achieving such projected cash flows 
in developing these cash flow projections  revenues were estimated based on relevant factors  including aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  individual service offering revenues  characteristics of the potential market for the service offerings and the anticipated life of the underlying technology 
operating expenses and resulting profit margins were estimated based on the characteristics and cash flow generating potential of the acquired in process research and development  and included assumptions that certain expenses would decline over time as operating efficiencies were obtained 
the company assumed material net cash inflows would commence in for the epicon licensing agreement and insignia acquisition and in for the apm and vdonet acquisitions 
appropriate adjustments were made to operating income to derive net cash flow  and the estimated net cash flows of the in process technologies in each acquisition were then discounted to present value using rates of return that the company believes reflect the specific risk return characteristics of these research and development projects 
the selection of discount rates for application in each acquisition were based on the consideration of i the weighted average cost of capital  which measures a company s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in its target capital structure  ii the corresponding weighted average return on assets which measures the after tax return required on the assets employed in the business weighted by each asset group s percentage of the total asset portfolio  and iii venture capital required rates of return which typically relate to equity financing for relatively high risk business projects 
the risk adjusted discount rates were   and for the epicon licensing agreement  insignia  apm and vdonet acquisitions  respectively 
revenues attributable to the acquired in process technology were assumed to increase depending on the product between the first two to five years of six to seven year projection periods at annual rates ranging from to before decreasing over the remaining years at rates ranging from to as other products are released in the marketplace 
projected annual revenue attributable to the products ranged from approximately million to million over the term of the projections 
these projections were based on aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  individual product revenues  giving consideration to transaction volumes and prices  anticipated growth rates for the client server market  anticipated product development and product introduction cycles  and the estimated life of the underlying technology 
projected revenues from the in process research and development were assumed to peak during periods between and  depending on the product  and decline from to as other new products are expected to enter the market 
gross profit was assumed to increase in the first two to five years of the projection period  depending on the product  at annual rates ranging from to  decreasing over the remaining years at rates ranging from to annually  resulting in annual gross profits ranging from approximately  to million 
the gross profit projections assumed a growth rate approximately the same as the revenue growth rate 
operating profit was assumed to increase depending on the product  in the first two to four years of the projection period at annual rates ranging between and  and decrease over the remaining years at rates between and annually  resulting in annual operating profits of approximately million to million 
operating profit projections assumed a growth rate approximately the same as the revenue growth rate 
the company used discount rates ranging from to for valuing the in process research and development acquired in these transactions  which the company believes reflected the risk associated with the completion of the individual research and development projects acquired and the estimated future economic benefits to be generated subsequent to the projects completion 
a description of the in process research and development and the estimates made by the company for each of datapac  epicon  insignia  apm digitivity and vdonet is summarized below 
all of the acquired projects are targeted for the server based computing market 
after the acquisition or license of each technology  the company has continued the development of these in process projects 
datapac the in process research and development acquired in the datapac acquisition consisted primarily of one significant research and development project  vga connect  together with two minor projects 
vga connect is designed as an add on to winframe software and allows mvga cards to be used as direct connect workstations 
the company estimated these projects were less than complete at the date of acquisition 
the aggregate value assigned to the datapac in process research and development was million 
at the time of the valuation  the expected cost to complete all such projects was approximately epicon the in process research and development acquired in the license of epicon technology consisted of one significant research and development project  application installation services 
this project enables an application to be installed once on a server and then replicated to all other servers in a server farm configuration  and is targeted for the server based computing market 
at the date of licensing  epicon was shipping its windows nt version of its altis application deployment product and was testing its windows nt version 
neither the windows nt version nor the windows nt version of the altis product was operating in a citrix metaframe or winframe environment at the date of licensing 
after licensing the epicon technology  the company continued the development of this in process project  which the company estimated was less than complete at the date of licensing 
the aggregate value assigned to the in process research and development was million  after giving effect of the re evaluation described in overview 
at the time of the valuation  the expected cost to complete the project was approximately  as of december   approximately  had been incurred since the date of licensing 
the company estimates that approximately  will be required to complete the remaining research and development project and it is expected to be completed during the first half of the remaining efforts to complete the project are primarily the migration of the core processing from the client environment to the server environment and the integration of such technology into the company s metaframe and winframe products 
the research and development risks associated with this project primarily reside with the migration of the application installation services technology to the company s metaframe and winframe platforms  which are based on server based computing technology 
insignia the in process research and development acquired in the insignia acquisition consisted primarily of one significant research and development project  keoke  a video display protocol designed to add performance and bandwidth management enhancements to ica in winframe and metaframe software 
the company estimated this project was less than complete at the date of acquisition 
the aggregate value assigned to in process research and development was million 
at the date of the valuation  the expected cost to complete the keoke and other projects related to the acquisition was approximately million 
as of december   approximately  had been incurred since the date of acquisition 
the company estimates that approximately  will be required to complete the remaining research and development project and it is expected to be completed by the end of the remaining efforts to complete the project are primarily the utilization of performance enhancements and algorithmic methodologies of the keoke protocol to create similar improvements in the company s ica protocol 
the research and development risks associated with this project primarily relate to the integration of key performance features of keoke into the company s ica protocol 
apm the in process research and development acquired in the apm acquisition consisted primarily of one significant research and development project 
the project is a windows nt based application server for java  which is similar to winframe software  but actually runs java applications 
at the date of the acquisition  apm was shipping a secure server based enterprise solution that helped companies deploy and manage intranet and internet based java applications 
the company estimated this project was less than complete at the date of acquisition 
the aggregate value assigned to the in process research and development was million 
at the time of the valuation  the expected cost to complete the project was approximately million 
as of december   approximately million had been incurred since the date of acquisition 
the company estimates that approximately million will be required to complete the remaining research and development project and it is expected to be completed in the remaining effort to complete the project is primarily the utilization of acquired technology to develop an application server for java that would operate in a metaframe and winframe server environment 
the research and development risks associated with this project relate primarily to updating the acquired technology to be compatible with sun microsystems java application  integrating and porting such technology into a variety of server based computing architectures 
vdonet the in process research and development acquired in the vdonet acquisition consisted primarily of one significant research and development project  ica video services 
this project allows video applications and applications containing video to be viewed on an ica client  and is targeted for the server based computing market 
at the date of acquisition  vdonet was shipping a client server video streaming product 
the product operated in a client server environment but was not operational in a citrix metaframe or winframe environment 
after acquiring vdonet  the company continued the development of this in process project  which the company estimates was less than complete at the date of acquisition 
the aggregate value assigned to the in process research and development was million 
at the time of the valuation  the expected cost to complete the project was approximately  as of december   approximately million had been incurred since the date of acquisition 
the company estimates that approximately million will be required to complete the remaining research and development project and it is expected to be completed in the remaining effort to complete the project is primarily the utilization of acquired technology to develop a video server that will provide video applications to an ica client 
the research and development risks associated with this project relate primarily to integrating this product into the server based computing environment 
there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional charges in subsequent periods to reflect costs associated with these transactions or that the company will be successful in its efforts to integrate and further develop these technologies 
interest income  net 
the increase in interest income  net  in was primarily due to interest income earned on additional cash generated from the receipt of an initial license fee under the terms of the development agreement and  to a lesser extent  interest income generated from the net proceeds of the company s public offering completed in june income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate amounted to in and and in the increase in the effective annual tax rate is primarily due to the company s increased profitability and lack of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income in the current year 
such net operating loss carryforwards were included in the computation of the effective tax rate utilized in liquidity and capital resources during  cash provided by operating activities was million 
the cash inflow from operating activities was primarily attributable to the receipt of million under the terms of the development agreement  recognition of tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of approximately million and an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million 
these cash inflows were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities of million for related primarily to the purchase of investments of million and partially offset by cash inflows from the sale of investments totaling million 
cash was also used for acquisitions and a licensing agreement totaling million and the expenditure of approximately million for the purchase of leasehold improvements and equipment to support the company s growth and expansion into new facilities 
cash provided by financing activities of million related primarily to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the company s stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
during  the company generated positive operating cash flows primarily from the receipt of an initial license fee of million related to the development agreement 
the revenues from this development agreement are being recognized ratably over the contract period of five years  which caused a substantial increase in deferred revenue relating to the development agreement 
additionally  during the same period  the company increased profitability  which was partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets attributable to the taxability of the initial license fee received under the terms of the development agreement 
the company also recognized tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of approximately million 
the company also purchased and sold short term investments for approximately million and million  respectively  during additionally  the company expended approximately million in the same period for the purchase of leasehold improvements and equipment 
these capital expenditures were primarily associated with the company s relocation and expansion in its new facilities 
in  the company generated positive operating cash flows primarily from increased profitability 
in june  the company completed a public offering which generated net proceeds of approximately million 
during  the company recognized tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of approximately million 
additionally  deferred tax assets increased during by approximately million 
at december   the company had million in cash and investments and million of working capital 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are invested in investment grade  highly liquid securities to minimize interest rate risk and allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs 
at december   the company had million in accounts receivable  net of allowances  and million of deferred revenues  of which the company anticipates million will be earned over the next months 
the company believes existing cash and investments together with cash flow expected to be generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditures requirements through the company may also from time to time seek to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
year readiness disclosure until recently  many computer programs were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year in the twentieth century 
such software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the consequences of this issue may include systems failures and business process interruption to the extent companies fail to upgrade  replace or otherwise address year problems 
the year problem may also result in additional business and competitive differentiation 
aside from the well known calculation problems with the use of digit date formats as the year changes from to  the year is a special case leap year 
as a result  significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential impact of the year problem 
the company believes that it has four general areas of potential exposure with respect to the year problem i its own software products  ii its internal information systems  iii computer hardware and other equipment related systems  and iv the effects of third party compliance efforts 
the company s existing principal software product lines consist of winframe and metaframe software 
the company s winframe product line is an authorized extension to microsoft windows nt 
the company s metaframe product line adds additional functionality to nt terminal server 
customers can obtain current information about the year compliance of the company s products from the company s web site 
information on the company s web site is provided to customers for the sole purpose of assisting in planning for the transition to the year such information is the most currently available concerning the behavior of the company s products in the next century and is provided as is  without warranty of any kind 
while the company believes that the current versions of its winframe and metaframe products are capable of storing four digit year data  allowing applications to differentiate between dates from the s and the year and beyond  the potential incompatibility with two digit application programs may limit the company s sales of product in those situations 
further  notwithstanding the operating system s ability to store four digit year data  it is typically the application s function to collect and properly store date data 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be integrated by the company or its customers with  or otherwise interact with  non year compliant software or other products which may malfunction and expose the company to claims from its customers or other third parties 
the foregoing could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of the company s products and services  increased service costs to the company or payment by the company of compensatory or other damages 
although the company believes that many windows applications do store four digit year dates today  it is possible that some applications are now or have historically only collected two digit year data  and in such cases winframe cannot create four digit year data for applications which have collected only two digits in year fields 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s software products that are designed to be year compliant contain all necessary technology to make them year compliant 
if any of the company s licensees experience year problems  such licensees could assert claims for damages against the company 
with respect to internal information systems  the company has commenced  but has not yet completed  a testing and compliance program to identify any year problems 
an audit has been conducted to identify all business critical applications and responses sought from vendors as to whether the application is compliant or not and what plans they have in place to ensure compliance before december  the third type of potential year exposure relates to the company s computer hardware and other equipment related systems including such equipment as the company s workstations  phone systems  security systems and elevator systems 
the company is in the final stages of identifying and evaluating such systems year exposure 
at this point  the company has not discovered any significant potential year exposure regarding its computer hardware and other equipment related systems 
the company expects to complete this portion of its compliance plan by the end of the second quarter of the company does not expect costs incurred to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition 
the fourth aspect of the company s year analysis involves evaluating the year efforts of third parties  including critical suppliers and other partners with whom the company has strategic relationships 
the company is in the process of contacting such critical suppliers and other parties through written and or telephone inquiries 
the company is conducting such inquiries with existing personnel and does not expect the costs of such inquiries to be material 
if the company determines  after conducting the aforementioned survey  that the year exposure of any critical suppliers or other strategic relationships could result in material disruptions to their respective businesses  the company may develop appropriate contingency plans 
further  if certain critical third party providers  such as those supplying outsourced manufacturing  electricity  water  or telecommunications services  experience difficulties resulting in a material interruption of services to the company  such interruption would likely result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
to date  the company has not incurred any material expenditure in connection with identifying or evaluating year compliance issues 
the company estimates it will not incur any material levels of expenditure on this issue during to support its compliance initiatives 
most of these expenses have been  and in the future are expected to be  related to the opportunity costs of employees evaluating the company s financial and accounting software  the current versions of the company s products  and year compliance matters generally 
the company believes that it is unlikely to experience a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations due to year compliance issues 
however  since the assessment process is ongoing  year complications are not fully known  and potential liability issues are not clear  the full potential impact of the year on the company is not known at this time 
as the company has recently replaced its fundamental financial and accounting software  no significant problems are anticipated which would result in either the delay or the inability to process accounting and financial data 
if the audit of the other software applications used by company leads to the discovery of further year compliance issues  the company intends to evaluate the need for one or more contingency plans relating to such issues 
the company s expectations as to the extent and timeliness of modifications required in order to achieve year compliance is a forward looking statement subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may vary materially as a result of a number of factors  including  among others  those described in this paragraph 
there can be no assurance however  that the company will be able to successfully modify on a timely basis such products  services and systems to comply with year requirements  which failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
further  while the company believes that its year compliance efforts will be completed on a timely basis  and in advance of the year date transition  there can be no assurance that unexpected delays or problems  including the failure to ensure year compliance by systems or products supplied to the company by a third party  will not have an adverse effect on the company  its financial performance  or the competitiveness or customer acceptance of its products 
further  the company s current understanding of expected costs is subject to change as the project progresses and does not include potential costs related to actual customer claims  or the cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business unless such installation has been accelerated to provide solutions to year compliance issues 
european monetary union on january  eleven of the existing members of the european union eu joined the european monetary union 
this will lead  among many other things  to fundamental changes in the way participating eu states implement their monetary policies and manage local currency exchange rates 
ultimately  there will be a single currency within certain countries of the eu  known as the euro and one organization  the european central bank  responsible for setting european monetary policy 
while some believe that the change will bring a higher level of competition within europe and a greater sense of economic stability within that region  there is no certainty that the company s activity in this region will necessarily realize any benefits as a result of such changes 
the company has reviewed the impact the euro will have on its business and whether this will give rise to a need for significant changes in its commercial operations or treasury management functions 
while it is uncertain whether there will be any immediate direct benefits from the planned conversion  the company believes it is properly prepared to accommodate any changes deemed necessary after january  without any significant changes to its current commercial operations  treasury management and management information systems 
certain factors which may affect future results the company does not provide financial performance forecasts 
citrix s operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
except for the historical information in this report  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

citrix depends upon the license of key technology from microsoft  including certain source and object code licenses and technical support 
citrix also depends upon its strategic alliance agreement with microsoft pursuant to which the company and microsoft have agreed to cooperate to develop advanced operating systems and promote windows application program interfaces 
the company s relationship with microsoft is subject to the following risks and uncertainties 
competition with microsoft 
nt terminal server is  and future product offerings by microsoft may be  competitive with citrix s current winframe and metaframe products  and any future product offerings by citrix 

termination of microsoft s endorsement of the ica protocol 
microsoft has agreed to endorse only the company s ica protocol as the preferred method to provide multi user windows access for devices other than windows clients until at least november subsequent to november  or before november if certain events occur as provided in the development agreement  it is possible that microsoft will market or endorse other methods to provide non windows client devices multi user windows access 

dependence on microsoft for commercialization 
citrix s ability to successfully commercialize its metaframe product depends on microsoft s ability to market nt terminal server products 
citrix does not have control over microsoft s distributors and resellers and  to the company s knowledge  microsoft s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from microsoft 

product release delays 
there may be delays in the release and shipment of future versions of nt terminal server 
dependence upon broad based acceptance of ica protocol citrix believes that its success in the markets in which it competes will depend upon its ability to make ica protocol a widely accepted standard for supporting windows applications 
if another standard emerges or if the company otherwise fails to achieve wide acceptance of the ica protocol as a standard for supporting windows applications  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
microsoft includes as a component of nt terminal server its remote desktop protocol rdp which has certain of the capabilities of the company s ica protocol  and may offer customers a competitive solution 
the company believes that its success is dependent on its ability to enhance and differentiate its ica protocol  and foster broad acceptance of the ica protocol based on its performance  scalability  reliability and enhanced features 
in addition  the company s ability to win broad market acceptance of its ica protocol will depend upon the degree of success achieved by its strategic partners in marketing their respective platforms  product pricing and customers assessment of its technical  managerial service and support expertise 
if another standard emerges or if the company fails to achieve wide acceptance of the ica protocol as a standard for supporting windows applications  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
dependence upon strategic relationships in addition to its relationship with microsoft  the company has strategic relationships with ibm  compaq  wyse and others 
the company depends upon its strategic partners to successfully incorporate the company s technology into their products and to market and sell such products 
if the company is unable to maintain its current strategic relationships or develop additional strategic relationships  or if any of its key strategic partners are unsuccessful at incorporating its technology into their products or marketing or selling such products  the company s business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
competition the markets in which citrix competes are intensely competitive 
most of its competitors and potential competitors  including microsoft  have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than the company 
the announcement of the release and the actual release of products competitive with the company s existing and future product lines  such as nt terminal server and related enhancements  could cause existing and potential customers of the company to postpone or cancel plans to license the company s product lines 
this would adversely impact the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
further  the company s ability to market ica  metaframe and other future product offerings may be affected by microsoft s licensing and pricing scheme for client devices implementing the company s product offerings which attach to nt terminal server 
in addition  alternative products exist for internet commerce that directly or indirectly compete with the company s products 
existing or new products that extend web site software to provide database access or interactive computing can materially impact the company s ability to sell its products in this market 
as markets for the company s products continue to develop  additional companies  including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware  software and networking industries  may enter the markets in which the company competes and further intensify competition 
finally  although the company believes that price has historically been a less significant competitive factor than product performance  reliability and functionality  the company believes that price competition may become more significant in the future 
the company may not be able to maintain its historic prices  and any inability to do so could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of these and other factors  the company may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors  which would have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on proprietary technology citrix relies primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect its proprietary rights 
the company s efforts to protect its proprietary technology rights may not be successful 
the loss of any material trade secret  trademark  tradename  or copyright could have a material adverse affect on the company 
despite the company s precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products or to obtain and use information regarded as proprietary 
substantially all of the company s sales are derived from the licensing of its products under shrink wrap license agreements that are not signed by licensees and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the company s ability to protect its proprietary rights may be affected by the following 
differences in international law 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and canada 

third party infringement claims 
third parties may assert infringement claims against the company in the future 
this may result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of such third parties 
such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
as a result of these and other factors  the company may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
product concentration the company anticipates that its metaframe and winframe product lines and related enhancements will constitute the majority of its revenue for the foreseeable future 
the metaframe product  when combined with nt terminal server  provides capabilities similar to those currently offered in the winframe technology line 
therefore  the company s ability to generate revenue from its metaframe product will depend upon market acceptance of nt terminal server products 
the company expects that revenue from metaframe based products will constitute an increasing percentage of total revenue in the near future and that revenue from winframe based products will decrease over time as a percentage of total revenue 
declines in demand for products based on winframe technology may occur as a result of new competitive product releases  price competition  lack of success of its strategic partners  technological change or other factors 
in addition  the introduction of products based on the metaframe technology may create competition with its winframe product line and may delay or replace orders of either product line 
year until recently  many computer programs were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year in the twentieth century 
such software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year the consequences of this issue may include systems failures and business process interruption to the extent companies fail to upgrade  replace or otherwise address year problems 
the year problem may also result in additional business and competitive differentiation 
aside from the well known calculation problems with the use of digit date formats as the year changes from to  the year is a special case leap year and in many organizations using older technology  dates were used for special programmatic functions 
as a result  significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential impact of the year problem 
the company believes it has four general areas of potential exposure with respect to the year problem 
its own software products  
its internal information systems  
computer hardware and other equipment related systems  and 
the effects of compliance efforts by third parties  including our partners  suppliers and vendors 
while the company believes that the current versions of its winframe and metaframe products are currently capable of storing four digit year data  allowing applications to differentiate between dates from the s and the year and beyond  the potential incompatibility with two digit application programs may limit the company s sales of product in those situations 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will not be integrated by the company or its customers with  or otherwise interact with  non year compliant software or other products which may malfunction and expose the company to claims from its customers or other third parties 
the company has not yet completed its assessment of year compliance issues with respect to all of these areas 
since the year complications are not fully known  potential year problems could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel the company s success will depend  in large part  upon the services of a number of key employees 
the company does not have long term employment agreements with any of its key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his relationship at any time 
the effective management of the company s anticipated growth will depend  in a large part  upon the company s ability to i retain its highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel  and ii to attract and maintain replacements for and additions to such personnel in the future 
competition for such personnel is intense and may affect the company s ability to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
new products and technological change the markets for the company s products are relatively new and are characterized by 
rapid technological change  
evolving industry standards  
changes in end user requirements  and 
frequent new product introductions and enhancements  including enhancements to certain key technology licensed from microsoft 
these market characteristics will require the company to continually enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products to keep pace with technological developments and respond to evolving end user requirements 
additionally  the company and others may announce new product enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of the company s existing product offerings 
the company believes it will incur additional costs and royalties associated with the development  licensing or acquisition of new technologies or enhancements to existing products 
this will increase the company s cost of revenues and operating expenses 
the company cannot currently quantify such increase with respect to transactions that have not occurred 
the company may use a substantial portion of its cash and investments to fund these additional costs  resulting in a decrease in interest income  unless such decrease is offset by cash flows from future operations 
the company may need to hire additional personnel to develop new products  product enhancements and technologies and to fulfill the company s responsibilities under the terms of the development agreement 
if the company is unable to add additional staff and resources  future enhancement and additional features to its existing or future products may be delayed  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential for undetected errors despite significant testing by the company and by current and potential customers  new products may contain errors after commencement of commercial shipments 
additionally  the company s products depend upon certain third party products which may contain defects and could reduce the performance of the company s products or render them useless 
since the company s products are often used in mission critical applications  errors in the company s products or the products of third parties upon which the company s products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by the company s customers 
reliance upon indirect distribution channels and major distributors the company relies significantly on independent distributors and resellers for the marketing and distribution of its products 
the company does not control its distributors and resellers 
additionally  the company s distributors and resellers are not obligated to purchase products from the company and may also represent other lines of products 
need to expand channels of distribution the company intends to leverage its relationships with hardware and software vendors and systems integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute the company s products 
in addition  an integral part of the company s strategy is to expand its direct sales force and add third party distributors both domestically and internationally 
the company is currently investing  and intends to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could reduce the company s profits 
maintainence of growth rate the company s revenue growth rate in may not approach the levels attained in  and the company s growth during those three years is largely attributable to the introduction of metaframe in mid and winframe in late to the extent revenue growth continues  the company believes that its cost of revenues and certain operating expenses will also increase 
due to the fixed nature of a significant portion of such expenses  together with the possibility of slower revenue growth  its income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities may decrease as a percentage of revenues in new accounting pronouncements in march  the accounting standards board issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company plans to adopt sop in  which will require the capitalization of certain costs incurred after the date of adoption in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use 
the company currently expenses such costs as incurred 
management has not yet determined what the effect of sop will be on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in process research and development valuation the company recently re evaluated the amounts previously charged to in process research and development in connection with certain acquisitions and licensing arrangements 
the amount and rate of amortization of such amounts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  the effects of any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the staff of the commission or the accounting profession 
any changes in accounting standards or guidance adopted by the staff of the commission  may materially adversely affect future results of operations through increased amortization expense 
revenue recognition process the company continually re evaluates its programs  including specific license terms and conditions  to market its current and future products and services 
the company may implement new programs  including offering specified and unspecified enhancements to its current and future product lines 
the company may recognize revenues associated with such enhancements after the initial shipment or licensing of the software product or over the product s life cycle 
the timing of the implementation of such programs  the timing of the release of such enhancements and other factors will impact the timing of the company s recognition of revenues and related expenses associated with its products  related enhancements and services 
as a result of these factors  the company currently cannot quantify the impact of the re evaluation of its programs on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
product returns and price reductions the company provides certain of its distributors with product return rights for stock balancing or limited product evaluation 
the company also provides certain of its distributors with price protection rights 
to cover these product returns and price protections  the company has established reserves based on its evaluation of historical trends and current circumstances 
the company believes that it has adequate reserves to cover product returns and price protections 
however  these reserves may not be sufficient in the future 
international operations the company s continued growth and profitability will require further expansion of its international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  the company must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
such international operations are subject to certain risks  such as 
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
dependence on independent relicensors  
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  
compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  
variability of foreign economic and political conditions  
changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by united states export laws  
costs of localizing products and marketing such products in foreign countries  
longer accounts receivable payment cycles  
potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings  
difficulties in protecting intellectual property  and 
burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
volatility of stock price the market price for the company s common stock has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date 
the trading price of the common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results  anticipated revenue or earnings growth  analyst reports or recommendations and other events or factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of the common stock  regardless of the company s actual operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation  if instituted  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions the demand for the company s products depends in part upon the general demand for computer hardware and software  which fluctuates based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
management of growth and higher operating expenses the company has recently experienced rapid growth in the scope of its operations  the number of its employees and the geographic area of its operations 
in addition  the company has completed certain international acquisitions since october such growth and assimilation of acquired operations and personnel of such acquired companies has placed and may continue to place a significant strain on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage its growth effectively  the company must continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls 
the company believes that it has made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with these expansions 
however  its systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support its current or future operations 
in addition  the company may not be able to effectively manage this expansion and still achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully exploit the market opportunity for its products and services in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s future operating results will also depend on its ability to manage its expanding product line  expand our sales and marketing organizations and expand its support organization commensurate with the increasing base of its installed product 
the company plans to increase its professional staff during as it implements sales  marketing and support and product developments efforts  as well as associated administrative systems  to support planned growth 
as a result of this planned growth in the size of its staff  the company believes that it will require additional facilities during although the company believes that the cost of such additional facilities will not significantly impact its financial position or results of operations  the company anticipates that operating expenses will increase during as a result of its planned growth in staff 
such an increase in operating expenses may reduce its income from operations and cash flows from operating activities in anti takeover effect of charter  by laws  delaware law and contractual provisions  availability of preferred stock for issuance provisions of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by laws  as amended  as well as delaware law could discourage a proxy contest or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of the company s common stock 
the company is subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders 
the company s agreements with microsoft contain prohibitions on assignment which could have the effect of deterring an acquisition by a third party  or limiting the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  the company s board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that may be superior to the common stock and that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company maintains a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  highly liquid  debt securities which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the securities in the company s investment portfolio are not leveraged and are generally classified as available for sale and therefore are subject to interest rate risk 
the company does not currently hedge interest rate exposure 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  levels  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million
