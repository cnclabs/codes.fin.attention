item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this filing 
overview the company is an independent distributor of microcomputer products  including personal computers  memory modules  disc drives and networking products  operating primarily in western europe and the united states 
the company has pursued and expects to continue to pursue a strategy of purchasing product for resale on the worldwide surplus or aftermarket as opposed to purchasing products for resale directly from manufacturers 
the company s ability to purchase products for resale in these markets has enabled the company to increase net sales 
for the three year period ended june   the company s total net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company attributes these increases in sales to increased customer demand for the company s products and  more recently  to the expansion of the range of products offered and geographical markets served 
to date  the company has derived the majority of its operating income and cash flow from european micro uk 
generally  european micro uk purchases and sells its products in currencies other than the united states dollar 
european micro uk seeks to limit its exposure to currency fluctuations through hedging

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations percentage of net sales years ending june  net sales net sales to related parties total net sales cost of goods sold cost of goods sold to related parties total cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense equity in net income loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries income before income taxes income tax expense net income years ended june  and total net sales 
total net sales increased million  or  from million in the year ended june  to million in the comparable period in excluding net sales to related parties  net sales increased million  or  from million in the year ended june  to million in the comparable period in this increase was attributable to the start up growth of nor easter which started its operations in february accounting for approximately million  the addition of sunbelt s trading sales accounting for approximately million  the growth of the premier dealers club accounting for approximately million and the additional sales from sunbelt s nova line of products accounting for approximately million 
this increase was offset by a reduction in european micro uk s trading sales of million which was primarily due to the exceptional quarter ended march  when the company made a one time purchase of computer peripherals at favorable prices which were later sold at a significant mark up 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the level of sales or sales growth achieved in this period or prior periods because of seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services offered by the company  the introduction of new hardware and software technologies and products offering improved features and functionality  the introduction of new products and services by the company and its competitors  the loss or consolidation of a significant supplier or customer  changes in the level of operating expenses  inventory adjustments  product supply constraints and competitive conditions  including pricing  interest rate fluctuations  the impact of acquisitions  currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
for the years ended june  and  respectively  customer rebates and discounts were immaterial 
net sales to related parties decreased million from in the year ended june  to million in the comparable period in this decrease is primarily attributable to large purchases of computer peripherals made on behalf of related parties in the year ended june  compared to the same period in in addition  the company s purchases from related parties increased by million in the year ended june  from the comparable period in gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  from million in the year ended june  to million in the comparable period in gross profit excluding related party transactions decreased to million for the year ended june  from million in the same period of the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to a large volume purchase of computer peripherals in the prior year period which were purchased by the company on exceptional terms and later sold at a significant mark up 
in addition  this decrease is partially the result of a shift in market conditions  resulting in a downward pressure on margins due to currency fluctuations  product availability and changes in geographic pricing strategies of manufacturers and suppliers of the company s products 
gross profit was unusually high in the period ended june  due to the purchase of computer peripherals on favorable terms 
as indicated in its previous filings  the company expected its gross profit to be significantly lower in periods after fiscal because it did not expect to be able to regularly purchase computer peripherals and other products on terms as favorable as achieved in the period ended june  gross profit attributable to related party sales decreased  or  from  in the year ended june  to  in the comparable period in as discussed above  the mark up on sales to related parties is typically one percent over cost 
therefore  the gross profit on sales to third parties is typically higher than the gross profit earned on sales to related parties 
this represents a gross margin of approximately 
gross margins decreased from in the year ended june  to in the comparable period in excluding related party transactions  gross margin decreased from in the year ended june  to in the comparable period in the decrease in gross margins was attributable to higher than usual margins caused by the purchase of computer peripherals in which were purchased by the company on exceptional trading terms and subsequently sold at significant mark ups 
foreign exchange losses  net  increased from a loss of  in the year ended june  to a loss of  in the comparable period in this increase was attributable to a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling and a weakening of the euro relative to other european currencies 
these movements created unfavorable purchasing and selling conditions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations currency risk management 
operating expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales increased from in the year ended june  to in the comparable period in commissions and bonus payments to employees decreased as these payments are tied to the company s gross profit and gross margin 
this decrease was offset by increased operating expenses related to the opening of the singapore office in november and administrative expenses incurred by european micro holdings  inc which began operations in january  but did not start to incur substantial expenses until april interest expense 
interest expense decreased by  from  in the year ended june  to  in the comparable period in this was attributable to decreased borrowings by the company to fund its inventory and accounts receivable after the receipt of funds from the company s initial public offering 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes increased from in the year ended june  to in the comparable period in this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the tax provision for european micro germany related to transfer pricing from european micro uk  changes in the valuation allowance and other nondeductible expenses 
the company s effective income tax rate may increase or decrease in the future as a result of the company s product mix and variations in the countries to which the company sells its products 
interest in joint venture 
the company s share of income or loss from big blue europe changed from a gain of  in the year ended june  to a loss of  in the comparable period in this reduction in earnings is attributed to an increased provision for inventory obsolescence 
during the year ended june   the company made an unsecured loan to big blue europe in the amount of  this loan is due on demand and has an annual interest rate of  payable quarterly 
years ended june  and total net sales 
total net sales increased million  or  from million in the year ended june  to million in the comparable period in the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to sales to related parties accounting for approximately million  the purchase of computer peripherals on favorable terms and subsequently sold in the period accounting for approximately million  the broadening of the company s product base accounting for approximately million  the return of some key personnel from temporary leave accounting for approximately million and the growth of the premier dealers club accounting for approximately million 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain the level of sales or sales growth achieved in this period because the company does not expect to be able to regularly purchase peripherals and other products on terms as favorable as achieved in the period ended june  for the years ended june  and  respectively  customer rebates and discounts were immaterial 
excluding net sales to related parties  net sales increased million  or  from million in the year ended june  to million in comparable period in net sales to related parties increased million from  in the year ended june  to million in the comparable period in this increase is attributable to group purchases by the company of computer peripherals made on behalf of related parties and subsequently by related parties to third parties 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  from million in the year ended june  to million in the comparable period in gross profit excluding related party transactions increased to million the year ended june  from million in the same period of the prior year 
gross profit was unusually high in the period due to the purchase of computer peripherals on favorable terms during the year ended june  the company expects its gross profit to be significantly lower in future periods because it does not expect to be able to regularly purchase computer peripherals and other products on terms as favorable as achieved in the period ended june  gross margins increased from in the year ended june  to in the comparable period in excluding related party transactions  gross margin increased from in the year ended june  to in the comparable period in the increase in gross margins was attributable to higher than usual margins caused by the purchase of computer peripherals in the period which were purchased by the company on exceptional trading terms and subsequently sold 
the company expects its gross margin to be significantly lower in future periods because it does not expect to be able to regularly purchase products on as favorable terms as that experienced in the period 
foreign exchange losses  net  increased from a loss of  in the year ended june  to a loss of  in the comparable period in during the second quarter of fiscal  the company suffered considerable exchange losses as a result of the strengthening of the uk pound sterling relative to other european currencies  causing a devaluation of many of the company s foreign currency accounts receivable 
operating expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales decreased from in the year ended june  to in the comparable period in due primarily to the increase in total net sales relative to operating expenses 
operating expenses consist primarily of fixed costs  such as wages  salaries  rents and rates 
excluding related party transactions  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from in the year ended june  to in the comparable period in due to higher commissions and bonus compensation paid during the period 
the company s commission and bonus compensation is based on the company s gross margin 
for the reasons set forth above  the company achieved higher gross margins in the period which resulted in higher commission and bonus compensation in the period 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by  from  in the year ended june  to  in the comparable period in this was attributable to increased borrowings by the company to fund its inventory and accounts receivable due to the large increase in sales during the period 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes decreased from in the year ended june  to in the comparable period in this decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in income before income taxes relative to disallowed expenditures for corporate income tax purposes 
the effective rate of income tax may increase in the future periods as a result of the change in structure and the mix of sales across the various countries to which the company sells its products 
interest in joint venture 
the company s share of income or loss from big blue europe increased from a loss of  in the year ended june  to a gain of  in the comparable period in these earnings are attributable to the business maturing past the start up stage 
warehouse break in 
in november  european micro uk s warehouse was broken into and approximately  of inventory was stolen 
all inventory was insured and the company was reimbursed by its insurance company for the cost of the inventory less an  standard deductible 
in order to prevent any additional thefts  the company has implemented the following steps the company has relocated its warehouse facility to a more secure location 
the company consulted with a security specialist and expended over  in security measures  including direct radio communication with law enforcement 
the company implemented new procedures regarding occupancy and the opening and closing of the warehouse facility 
seasonality the company typically experiences variations in its total net sales and net income on a quarterly basis as a result of many factors 
these include  but are not limited to  seasonal variations in demand for the products and services offered by the company  the introduction of new hardware and software technologies and products offering improved features and functionality  the introduction of new products and services by the company and its competitors  the loss or consolidation of a significant supplier or customer  changes in the level of operating expenses  inventory adjustments  product supply constraints  competitive conditions including pricing  interest rate fluctuations  the impact of acquisitions  currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
historical operating results have included a reduction in demand in europe during the summer months 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements are for operating expenses  funding accounts receivable and for the purchase of additional inventory to support growth and to take greater advantage of available cash discounts offered by certain of the company s suppliers for early payment and to make acquisitions 
the company has historically funded these cash requirements through a combination of loans  internally generated cash flow and the net proceeds of its initial public offering 
short term working capital requirements are funded by a combination of line of credit facilities together with accounts receivable financing 
both of these facilities are set and reviewed annually 
in both cases  the amounts drawn down accrue the same rate of interest based on a markup over the bank borrowing rate in the united kingdom 
the overdraft facility was million pounds sterling million at june  and the accounts receivable financing provides for a borrowing base of of accounts receivable  with a limit of million pounds sterling million on june  
further funding was obtained in june in the form of a short term revolving credit agreement  secured against inventory 
the facility allows the company to borrow up to million pounds sterling million on june  to assist in the purchase of inventory 
in addition  in june  the company received million in gross proceeds from its initial public offering of  shares of common stock 
the company incurred total expenses in connection with the offering of million 
the company has used the proceeds to fund operations and provide working capital to european micro uk and nor easter and to acquire sunbelt 
long term funding is supplied to the company in the form of capital lease agreements 
these agreements are secured by vehicles owned by the company 
the agreements are usually for months from the date of purchase and are typically for of the purchase value of the vehicle 
all but two of the agreements are subject to variable rate interest 
as of june   the borrowings were  of which  was due after more than one year 
subsequent to the company s fiscal year ended june   the company acquired amcc for a purchase price of  plus an earn out 
see related party tranasactions 
the portion of the purchase price paid at closing was funded through the company s working capital 
the earn out portion of the purchase price is expected to be funded through the company s working capital or the issuance of the shares of common stock 
on july   european micro uk purchased the office building in which they had previously been leasing space for  pounds sterling  at june  
the purchase price was financed in part by a loan in the amount of  pounds sterling  at june  at an annual interest rate of  payable over ten years 
fiscal year ended june  net cash used in operating activities for fiscal amounted to million 
significant factors in the use of cash were an decrease in trade payables  net of effects from acquisitions  of million  an increase in inventories  net of effects from acquisitions of million and an increase of trade receivables  net of effects from acquisitions of million 
the decrease in trade payables was largely attributable to paying down the large payables balance that was acquired in the sunbelt acquisition 
the increase in inventory was largely attributable to large quantity purchases of computer products at prices which the company considered to be favorable and a relatively low level of inventory at june  the increase in trade receivables is largely attributable to the increase in third party sales 
the amount of cash used in the company s operations was partially offset by net income in the period of  cash generated from a reduction in other current assets of million  primarily related to the prepayment of inventory at june  of million 
cash used in investing activities amounted to million 
this consisted of expenditures on fixed assets of  the sale of fixed assets of  the acquisitions of sunbelt and h b of  and an advance to big blue europe of  cash provided by financing activities was million  of which million was provided by an increase in the accounts receivable financing facility and million was provided by an increase in the bank line of credit 
fiscal year ended june  cash provided by operating activities for fiscal amounted to million 
significant factors in the generation of cash were net income for the year of million and increases in taxes payable of million 
the cash provided by operations was partially offset primarily by the increases in trade receivables of million  which was a result of the considerable increase in business during the period  including significant uk sales with longer credit terms and an advance payment made for the purchase of inventory of million 
the advance payment was made to take advantage of favorable pricing 
further  cash was used to pay down trade payables by  and an increase in due from related parties of  cash used in investing activities amounted to  this was attributed to the purchase of fixed assets amounting to  less the sale of fixed assets of  the purchase of fixed assets consisted primarily of expenditures for office improvements as the company moved onto an additional floor at their manchester  england of  new computers and office equipment of  a forklift for the warehouse of  and new vehicles of  the sale of fixed assets consisted primarily of used vehicles traded for the purchase of new vehicles 
cash provided by financing activities amounted to million 
this was primarily the result of the receipt of net proceeds from the initial offering of million million proceeds less expenses of million 
cash used in financing activities amounted to million to repay the short term financing facilities and the payment of a cash dividend of  prior to the company s initial public offering 
fiscal year ended june  cash provided by operating activities during the year amounted to  significant factors in the generation of cash were net income for the year amounting to million and increases in trade payables of million 
this was due primarily to a significant move towards third party suppliers as opposed to related party purchases which had been particularly high in cash was also provided by reductions in amounts due from related parties  and a decrease in other current assets 
the cash provided by operations was partially offset primarily by the decrease in amounts due to related parties of  as a result of the high third party purchases  an increase in trade receivables of  and an increase in inventory of  the increase in trade receivables was due to both a movement away from central european sales towards uk sales  which traditionally have longer credit terms and the continuing pressure to offer longer credit terms to the maturing marketplace 
cash used in investing activities amounted to  which was primarily attributed to the purchase of fixed assets amounting to  which was partially offset by disposals  and the investment in an unconsolidated affiliate  big blue europe of  the larger fixed asset purchases included the addition of two cars  and computer equipment for additional staff  network upgrades and laptop computers 
fixtures and fittings purchases during the year of  included additional furniture for the increase in employees and  for warehouse security measures 
cash used in financing activities amounting to  was used primarily for the payment of dividends amounting to  reductions in the bank overdraft amounting to  and repayment of capital leases of  the generation of  through trade receivable discounting was brought about partially through the increase in trade receivables and partially through a change in banking policy in december while the company had only discounted uk receivables up to december  the change in policy allowed the company to additionally discount central european trade receivables 
against this increase in the discounting creditor the level of the bank overdraft was reduced and this is reflected by the  adverse change in the bank overdraft 
exchange movements of  had a favorable effect on cash 
this arises as a result of the year end sterling to dollar exchange rate moving from pound as of june   to pound as of june  and the resulting effect on translating the balance of net assets as of june  together with the retained earnings for the year ended june  year issues many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the year if not corrected in the computer applications of the company or its suppliers and customers  this problem may cause computer applications to fail or to create erroneous results by or at the year in  the company initiated a plan plan to identify  assess and remediate year issues within each of its significant computer programs and certain equipment which contain microprocessors 
the company has divided the plan into five major phases assessment  planning  conversion  implementation and testing 
the company completed the assessment and planning phases in fiscal during fiscal  the company has addressed the conversion  implementation and testing phases 
the plan addresses each subsidiary differently 
all computer equipment  software and other non information technology equipment owned by nor easter and colchester were year compliant when purchased and therefore the costs of conversion and remediation were minimal 
european micro uk and sunbelt have obtained assurances from manufacturers of all of its computer equipment  software and other non information technology equipment as to whether they are year compliant 
the company believes that all non compliant software and hardware have been upgraded or replaced 
the company budgeted an aggregate of  to cover these costs 
the company does not generally sell software products and therefore the company does not expect its products to be affected by the year problem 
the company has evaluated the impact the year problem will have on its suppliers  customers  financial institutions  freight carriers and general economic infrastructure 
the company is not highly dependent upon any single supplier except technology express or customer and therefore does not expect the failure of the company s suppliers and customers to correct the year problem to have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that technology express is year complaint 
the company is dependent upon financial institutions  freight carriers and general economic infrastructure 
the company has received varying information from these outside parties regarding their state of readiness for the year problem 
the company has formulated contingency plans to implement in the event these parties fail to address the year problem 
the company s failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company s ability to insulate itself from the year problem is limited due to the company s inability to accurately gauge the readiness of its suppliers  customers  financial institutions  freight carriers and general economic infrastructure 
accordingly  the company cannot accurately anticipate or quantify the impact of the year problem or determine whether the failure to correct the year problem will have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  liquidity or financial condition 
asset management inventory 
the company s goal is to achieve high inventory turns and maintain a low inventory level and thereby reduce the company s working capital requirements 
the company s strategy to achieve this goal is to effectively manage its inventory and to achieve high order fill rates 
inventory levels may vary from period to period  due to factors including increases or decreases in sales levels  the company s practice of making large volume purchases when it deems such purchases to be attractive  new products and changes in the company s product mix 
accounts receivable 
the company sells its products and services to a customer base of more than value added resellers  corporate resellers  retailers and direct marketers 
the company offers credit terms to qualifying customers and also sells on a pre pay and cash on delivery basis 
with respect to credit sales  the company attempts to control its bad debt exposure by monitoring customers creditworthiness and  where practicable  through participation in credit associations that provide customer credit rating information for certain accounts 
also  substantially all of european micro uk s accounts receivables are insured 
nor easter  colchester and american micro generally do not insure their accounts receivable 
currency risk management reporting currency 
european micro holding s and nor easter s reporting and functional currency  as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 is the us dollar 
the functional currency of european micro uk is the uk pound sterling and colchester is the singapore dollar 
european micro uk and colchester translate into the reporting currency by measuring assets and liabilities using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and results of operations using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
hedging and currency management activities 
the company occasionally hedges to guard against currency fluctuations between the uk pound sterling and the us dollar 
because the functional currency of european micro holding s main operating subsidiary  european micro uk  is the uk pound sterling  currency fluctuations of the uk pound sterling relative to the uk dollar may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may engage in hedging activities in the future  although no assurances can be given that it will engage in such activities and if it does so that such activities will be successful 
european micro uk manages its currency exposure when transactions are consummated in currency other than united kingdom pound sterling 
for example  in the year ended june   purchases of inventory by european micro uk  were in united states dollars  united kingdom pound sterling  swedish krona  euro and other 
the most significant currencies in which sales were made  other than united kingdom pound sterling  were the euro united states dollar  swiss francs  and other 
additionally  receivables are also significantly spread out over several currencies 
in addition  european micro uk has exposure to currency fluctuations to the extent it maintains bank deposits in foreign currencies 
generally  the company s policy is not to hedge specifically against individual daily transactions 
instead  the exposure to a currency is determined every two to three days 
this is done by comparing the bank account balances and account receivables with accounts payable  all in the same currency to create a natural hedge 
thereafter  to the extent that a bank balance and the account receivable are not totally offset by the accounts payable  there would be a need to cover the residual credit balance with a forward currency contract 
the company tends to concentrate its currency management into seven currencies euro  uk pound sterling  uk dollar  dutch guilder  canadian dollar  singapore dollar and german mark 
it normally deems the exposure in other currencies to be minimal 
however  when the company buys products in other currencies  the company may  in conjunction with current market advice  book a forward contract to cover current and some anticipated future purchases 
economic and monetary union 
on january   eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and a new currency called the euro 
these countries adopted the euro as their common legal currency on that date 
the euro is trading on currency exchanges and is available for non cash transactions 
until january   the existing sovereign currencies will remain legal tender in these countries 
on january   the euro is scheduled to replace the sovereign legal currencies of these countries 
through the operations of european micro uk  the company has significant operations within the european union  including many of the countries which adopted the euro 
the company continues to evaluate the impact that the euro will have on its continuing business operations and no assurances can be given that the euro will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  the company does not expect the euro to have a material effect on its competitive position as a result of price transparency within the european union because the company does not rely on currency imbalances in purchasing inventory from within the european union 
in the first two quarters of trading  the euro devalued against sterling by  adversely affecting the value of the company s trade receivables denominated in euros 
going forward  the company cannot accurately predict the impact the euro will have on currency exchange rates or the company s currency exchange rate risk 
the internal revenue service irs has requested comments on various tax issues raised by the euro conversion 
the irs is expected to publish guidelines on this issue soon and  until such time  the company cannot predict whether the irs guidelines will have any tax consequences on the company 
related party transactions in order to achieve attractive prices from suppliers  the company must commit to purchasing large quantities of product 
to accomplish this  the company polls all the subsidiaries and technology express for informal commitments to help distribute that product 
thereafter  the purchasing entity  would obtain the product  examine the product for damage and authenticity  and then supervise the shipping to the other subsidiaries and the related party 
in such capacity  the purchasing entity acts as a purchasing agent for the other subsidiaries and the related party 
in the periods ending june   and  the company benefited from low mark up purchases from the related parties totaling million  million and million  respectively 
during the same periods  the company s sales to the related parties were million  million  and  these fluctuations are primarily due to currency fluctuations  product availability and changes in geographic pricing strategies of manufacturers and suppliers of the company s products 
on february   the company s board of directors formed a a special committee consisting solely of independent directors to evaluate and determine whether the company should acquire amcc and  if so  on what terms 
the members of the committee are kyle r 
saxon and barrett sutton 
the committee members were compensated at per hour each for their service on the committee 
john b 
gallagher  who is a significant shareholder  co chairman and co president of the company  was the president and a director of amcc and owned fifty percent of its outstanding capital stock 
frank cruz  who is chief operating officer of the company  was an employee of amcc since he is currently an employee of american micro  the newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of the company formed to acquire amcc 
the committee s charter authorized it to take any action it deemed necessary to properly evaluate and determine whether the company should acquire amcc  including hiring independent advisors and ensuring that any such transaction is entirely fair to the company and its shareholders 
the committee hired independent legal counsel and an independent financial advisor 
prior to consummating this transaction  the company received an opinion from the independent financial advisor that the consideration paid in connection with the transaction was fair from a financial point of view to the company s shareholders 
on july   the company acquired amcc 
the transaction was structured as a merger of amcc with and into american micro  a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
upon consummation of the merger  this subsidiary s name was changed to american micro computer center  inc the purchase price for amcc was equal to  plus an earn out amount payable in cash or shares of the company s common stock at the company s discretion equal to two times the after tax earnings of american micro in calendar year and two times the after tax earnings of american micro in calendar year the portion of the purchase price paid at closing was funded through the company s working capital 
the earn out portion of the purchase price is expected to be funded through the company s working capital or the issuance of shares of common stock 
in addition  the company assumed all outstanding indebtedness of amcc  including a shareholder loan in the approximate amount of  this loan is owed to the father of john b 
gallagher 
if the company elects to pay any portion of the purchase price in shares of the company s common stock  then amcc s shareholders have fifteen days to make arrangements to sell such shares over the next forty trading days 
if the sale of such shares results in net proceeds of less than the purchase price  then the company will pay the difference in cash to amcc s shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company utilizes derivative financial instruments in the form of forward exchange contracts for the purpose of economic hedges of anticipated sale and purchase transactions 
in addition  the company enters into economic hedges for the purposes of hedging foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets  liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of its ongoing business operations 
see currency risk management 
where the foreign currency exposure is covered by a forward foreign exchange contract the asset  liability or other obligation is recorded at the contracted rate each month end and the resultant mark to market gains and losses are recognized as cost of sales in the current period  generally consistent with the period in which the gain or loss of the underlying transaction is recognized 
cash flows associated with derivative transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows in a manner consistent with those of the exposure being hedged 
exchange rate sensitivity the table below summarizes information on foreign currency forward exchange agreements 
the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected contractual maturity dates in thousands except exchange rates
