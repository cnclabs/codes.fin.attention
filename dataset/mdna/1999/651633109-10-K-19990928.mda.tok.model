per share  for the year ended june   compared with net income of  or per share  for fiscal year excluding the effect of the accounting change and extraordinary item newmil s income grew in  reflecting improved core earnings  driven by higher net interest income and non interest income  and a lower loan loss provision  partly offset by increased operating expenses 
similarly  earnings per share before the effect of the accounting change and extraordinary item increased  reflecting both the growth in net income and share repurchase activity 
effective october  newmil adopted the provisions of sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
newmil took advantage of the provisions of sfas by reclassifying securities totaling million from held to maturity to available for sale  and then sold those securities 
newmil realized a loss  net of tax  of  on the transfer and sale of these securities 
this loss has been reported separately in net income as the cumulative effect of adopting sfas the securities were previously carried below cost as held to maturity  and an unrealized loss  net of taxes  of  against these securities had been included in shareholders equity prior to their sale 
newmil used the proceeds from the sale of the securities to prepay million of federal home loan bank fixed rate advances 
newmil incurred a prepayment fee  net of taxes  of  that has been reported in net income as an extraordinary item for this early extinguishment of debt

effective january   newmil s combined federal and state effective tax rate is  compared with an effective rate of prior to the deferred tax asset write off  discussed below  for the first two quarters of the fiscal year 
the formation of the pic required newmil to establish a valuation allowance against its existing deferred state tax assets that are no longer expected to be realized in future years 
accordingly  newmil s income tax provision for the year ended june  includes a charge of  over the past five years newmil has achieved a steady improvement in core earnings 
this is attributed to a continuing strategy which includes refining both the mix and the quality of newmil s earning assets  increasing non interest income  controlling operating expenses  and reducing non performing assets 
the following discussion and analysis of newmil s consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
results of operations comparison between and analysis of net interest and dividend income net interest income increased  or  to  in this resulted from growth of million  or  in average earning assets  driven by an increase in average loans of million  or 
the net interest margin declined basis points  to from

the level of net interest income is a function of volume  rates and mix of both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income can be adversely affected by changes in interest rate levels as determined by newmil s gap position  measured by the differences between the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing within different future time periods 
interest income total interest and dividend income decreased  or  to million in loan income increased  or  as a result of higher loan volume offset by lower average yield 
average loans increased million  or  to million in as compared with the decrease in average loan yield  down basis points  was mostly due to lower yields on loans originated during coupled with the downward repricing of adjustable rate loans and changes in portfolio mix 
most of the growth has been in residential mortgage loans that have lower yields relative to commercial loans 
investment income decreased  or  in as a result of lower average volume coupled with a slightly lower average yield 
average securities decreased million  or 
the decrease in average investment yield  down basis points  was due to lower reinvestment yields during and changes in portfolio mix 
interest expense interest expense decreased  or  to million in primarily as a result of changes in the deposit mix offset in part by higher average borrowings

although the allowance has been allocated among loan categories for purposes of the table  it is important to recognize that the allowance is applicable to the entire portfolio 
furthermore  charge offs in the future may not necessarily occur in these amounts or proportions

newmil provided  for loan losses in  down from  in and  in the reduction in newmil s provision over the past three years is due principally to an ongoing improvement in loan quality as evidenced by the steady reduction in non performing loans over the past five years  offset in part by loan portfolio growth 
during non performing loans decreased  or  to million at june  and  as a result  the reserve coverage to non performing loans increased to 
past due performing loans accruing loans days past due also decreased in and at june  represented of gross loans 
the decrease in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total gross loans during  to at june  compared to at june   is due to loan portfolio growth of million  or during loan growth has been primarily concentrated in residential mortgage loans that have a relatively low risk profile 
newmil remains adequately reserved both against total loans and non performing loans 
for a discussion on loan quality see asset quality and portfolio risk 
the bank determines its allowance and provisions for loan losses based upon a detailed evaluation of the loan portfolio through a process which considers numerous factors  including estimated credit losses based upon internal and external portfolio reviews  delinquency levels and trends  estimates of the current value of underlying collateral  concentrations  portfolio volume and mix  changes in lending policy  historical loan loss experience  current economic conditions and examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
determining the level of the allowance at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in the light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in management s judgement the allowance for loan losses at june   is adequate 
should the economic climate deteriorate  borrowers could experience difficulty and the level of non performing loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require increased provisions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies could require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgements of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the bank was examined by the fdic  in august and no additions to the allowance were requested as a result of this examination 
non interest income non interest income increased  or  to  in this increase is attributable to gains on sales of oreo in and security losses in  offset by a gain on the sale of a non performing loan in the principal categories of non interest income are as follows years ended june  change in thousands service charges on deposit accounts   gains on sales of loans  net securities losses gains  net gains on sales of oreo  gain on sale of non performing loan loan servicing other total non interest income   the increase in service charges on deposit accounts in reflects increased transaction volume  resulting from growth in demand deposit and now accounts and increased debit card transactions volume 
the increase in gains from sales of residential mortgage loans resulted from loan sales of million in compared with million in secondary market loan sales are generally pre arranged on a loan by loan basis prior to origination and loans are sold service released 
the net securities losses in were realized on securities sales of million and included a loss of  from the sale of a collateralized mortgage obligation cmo that was classified as held to maturity 
in october newmil engaged a financial securities consultant to analyze this cmo 
based on this review newmil determined that it was highly probable that newmil would likely receive substantially less than the contractual interest on this cmo and that the cmo could experience a significant decline in market value 
newmil concluded that these and other changes in circumstances surrounding this cmo were isolated  non recurring  and highly unusual  and could not have been reasonably anticipated 
the significant increase in oreo gains in resulted from the sale of two oreo properties and the sale of the bank s interest in a partnership formed several years ago to develop an oreo property into a residential subdivision 
in newmil realized a gain of  from the sale of its largest remaining non performing loan

employee benefits expense increased as a result of taxes and other benefits related to the increase in salaries  and due to increased medical claims from the bank s partially self insured plan 
these increases were partially offset by net income related to the bank s curtailed pension plan 
the decrease in occupancy and equipment expense is primarily due to reduced building maintenance expense in and the write off  in  of obsolete computer equipment and related prepaid maintenance in preparation for the conversion of the bank s core data processing systems to a new client server system

asset liability management and market risk newmil manages interest rate risk through an asset liability committee comprised of senior management 
the committee monitors exposure to interest rate risk on a quarterly basis using both a traditional gap analysis and simulation analysis 
traditional gap analysis identifies short and long term interest rate positions or exposure 
simulation analysis measures the amount of short term earnings at risk under both rising and falling rate scenarios 
newmil manages interest rate risk with the objective of maintaining a high and stable net interest margin under changing interest rate environments 
interest rate risk is measured using gap analysis  to identify short medium and long term interest rate risk positions  and simulation analysis  to measure the amount of short term earnings at risk under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
newmil seeks to manage interest rate risk within limits approved by the board of directors 
the following table sets forth newmil s interest rate sensitivity position  or gap position  at june   measured in terms of the volume of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities that are subject to repricing in future time periods 
for the purposes of this analysis  money market and savings deposits have been presented in the within month category and now account deposits have been presented in the after year category  although the interest rate elasticity of money market  savings and now deposits cannot be tied to any one time category 
non accrual loans and overdrafts have been presented in the non interest bearing category 
significant variations may exist in the degree of interest rate sensitivity between individual asset and liability types within the repricing periods presented due to differences in their repricing elasticity relative to changes in the general level of interest rates

a liability sensitive gap implies that newmil s net interest margin could be adversely affected by a sudden increase in interest rates 
newmil simulates earnings at risk over a twelve month horizon by ramping interest rates and basis points from the current rate environment 
during the year ended june  interest rates did not move basis points from their current rates 
newmil s asset liability management responds to changes in interest rates and market conditions 
the simulation analysis incorporates numerous assumptions about balance sheet changes  including growth and product mix  product pricing and the behavior of interest rates 
newmil s policy is to ensure that the change in net income over the twelve month horizon within the basis point band will not decrease by or more 
the following table indicates that the estimated percentage change in net income over the next twelve month forecast  for june  and  horizon is within newmil s tolerance limit 
change change in in rate net income bp bp bp bp due to the numerous assumptions in the simulation analysis  actual results will differ from estimated results 
factors other than changes in interest rates could also impact net income 
a significant factor in determining newmil s ability to maintain its net interest margin in a changing interest rate environment is its ability to manage its core deposit rates 
essentially all of newmil s deposit base is composed of local retail deposit accounts which tend to be somewhat less sensitive to moderate interest fluctuations than other funding sources and  therefore  provide a reasonably stable and cost effective source of funds 
the entry of new competitors into newmil s market area may pressure newmil to change its loan and deposit pricing which may negatively affect newmil s net interest margin 
newmil structures its loan and securities portfolios to provide for portfolio repricing consistent with its interest rate risk objectives 
capital resources during shareholders equity decreased  or  to million  while book value per share increased to at june  the decrease in shareholders equity resulted from treasury stock purchases of  and dividend payments of  offset by earnings of  a  decrease in the adjustment to shareholders equity for net unrealized holding losses on securities and  from the exercise of stock options 
in july newmil announced its intention to repurchase up to of its outstanding common stock in the open market and unsolicited negotiated transactions  including block purchases 
in april and july newmil announced its intention to buy additional shares of  and  respectively  under the same conditions 
the purpose of the repurchase plan is to offset the future dilution from shares issued upon the exercise of stock options under newmil s stock option plans  and for general corporate purposes 
during newmil repurchased  shares  or  of its outstanding shares of common stock 
as of june  newmil had repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock  under the july plan  and  shares of its outstanding common stock  under the april plan 
this represents of the total planned repurchases with total consideration of  being paid 
newmil and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements established  respectively  by the federal reserve board the frb and the fdic 
at june  newmil s leverage capital ratio was and its tier i and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
at june  the bank s leverage capital ratio was and its tier i and total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively 
newmil and the bank are categorized as well capitalized 
a well capitalized institution  which is the highest capital category for an institution as defined by the prompt corrective action regulations issued by the fdic and the frb  is one which maintains a total risk based ratio of or above  a tier i risk based ratio of or above and a leverage ratio of or above  and is not subject to any written order  written agreement  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
dividend restrictions newmil s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is dependent on the bank s ability to pay dividends to newmil 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the bank to newmil 
under connecticut law a bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on its common stock except from its net profit for the current year and retained net profits for the preceding two years 
consequently  the maximum amount of dividends payable by the bank to newmil at june  is  in some instances  further restrictions on dividends may be imposed on newmil by the frb 
in october newmil resumed dividend payments with the payment of a quarterly cash dividend  following a four year lapse 
in october   and newmil increased its quarterly cash dividend to   and  respectively 
in july newmil increased its quarterly dividend to 
for total dividends of per share were paid 
newmil believes that the payment of cash dividends to its shareholders is appropriate  provided that such payment considers newmil s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of newmil or the bank 
the continued payment of cash dividends by newmil will be dependent on newmil s future core earnings  financial condition and capital needs  regulatory restrictions  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors of newmil 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements there were no new accounting pronouncements which are expected to impact newmil at this time 
year year action plan in early newmil developed its year action plan plan to ensure that its operating systems  and those of its outside vendors and suppliers  will function correctly in the year and beyond 
during newmil became compliant with its year plan 
the plan is managed by the year committee  comprised of representatives from each operational area of the bank 
the plan has five phases awareness  assessment  renovation  validation  and  implementation 
the awareness phase included development of the plan  conducting awareness meetings and communicating with all newmil employees  attending year seminars and attending a user group meeting for the bank s legacy system vendor 
the awareness phase was completed during the assessment phase included the development of an inventory of all date sensitive systems  including in house systems and those of the bank s outside vendors and suppliers  a risk assessment of each element  and specific methodology to correct non compliant systems 
as of june  the assessment phase was completed for all items 
high criticality ratings were assigned to several systems  including the bank s legacy computer systems  that had the potential to substantially impact the bank s operation should they prove to be non compliant 
the renovation phase addresses the bringing of systems into compliance  systems replacements and retirements 
as of june  the renovation phase was completed for all items 
the validation phase addresses systems testing by the bank and its outside vendors and suppliers alike 
the bank converted its in house computer system in november from a legacy computer system to a client server relational database system 
the bank s new client server system has been certified year compliant by the supplying vendor and the bank verified compliance in early several third party interfaces were scheduled for testing in early as well 
all systems testing has been completed as of june  the implementation phase addresses the roll out of year compliant systems during and as of june  the implementation phase was completed for all items 
in addition  contingency plans have been developed for all systems with high criticality ratings 
testing of these contingency plans is proceeding according to plan and is expected to be completed by september newmil has completed an evaluation of its loan portfolio to identify credit risk arising from the potential failure of a borrower s operating or other systems as a consequence of the year newmil conducted mailings of a year questionnaire to all of its commercial borrowers and completed year risk to bank assessment ratings for all commercial borrowers in early federal banking agencies are conducting supervisory reviews of all financial institutions year readiness 
in february the fdic completed an assessment of the bank s year planning efforts 
in september the fdic conducted a supervisory review of the bank s year conversion effort 
in march the fdic and state of connecticut completed their year readiness phase ii assessment of the bank 
costs the cost of year compliance is expected to be minimal because the bank converted its in house data processing system to a new system which has been certified to be year compliant 
this cost has been capitalized and is being depreciated over the fixed assets useful lives 
based on current information  management believes that specific costs related to newmil s year systems issues will not have a material impact on the operations  cash flows or financial condition of newmil 
risks due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party vendors and borrowers  newmil is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures  if any  will have a material impact on newmil s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
however  based on newmil s high level of readiness and the readiness reported by all significant third party vendors  newmil does not expect any significant disruption of service 
the year action plan is expected to significantly reduce newmil s level of uncertainty about the year problem and  in particular  about the year readiness of its material vendors  suppliers and commercial borrowers 
newmil believes that  with the implementation of the new client server system and the completion of the plan as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations will be minimized 
impact of inflation and changing prices newmil s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate 
sharp decreases in real estate prices have  in past years  resulted in significant loan losses and losses on real estate acquired 
inflation  or disinflation  could significantly affect newmil s earnings in future periods
