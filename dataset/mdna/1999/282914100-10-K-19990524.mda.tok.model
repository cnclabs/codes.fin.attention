item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since june  the company has been executing a business strategy designed to focus the company s efforts exclusively on the development  manufacture and marketing of multimedia communication semiconductors  software and systems 
as part of this strategy  the company discontinued sales of its mpeg semiconductor product line and reduced its workforce in the quarter ended june  to date  the company has marketed its line of multimedia communication semiconductors and related technology to oems and distributors  mainly for videoconferencing and videophone applications 
this product line includes the lvp  vcp and vcpex semiconductors 
in an effort to expand the available market for its multimedia communication products  and to capitalize on its vertically integrated technology  the company began developing low cost consumer videophones and marketing these products to consumers under the viatv brand name in the viatv videophone enables phone call participants to both hear and see each other while communicating over a standard analog telephone line 
the company shipped its first viatv product in february  and over the next two years introduced several new videophone products  expanded its distribution channels in north america  europe and asia  and became a leading manufacturer of consumer videophones 
however in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company determined that a combination of factors including the high cost of maintaining a consumer distribution channel  the slower than expected growth rate of the consumer videophone market  and the low gross margins typical of a consumer electronics product made it unlikely that the consumer videophone business would be profitable in the foreseeable future 
therefore  the company announced in april that it would cease production of the viatv product line and withdraw from its distribution channels over the subsequent several quarters 
in conjunction with this decision the company recorded a million charge associated with the write off of viatv videophone inventories 
the company does not expect to be able to generate revenues from its other products to compensate for the loss of viatv revenues for at least the next twelve months  if at all 
if the company cannot adequately compensate for lower revenues with decreased manufacturing overhead expenses and with lower operating expenses  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
in june  the company entered the market for video monitoring products with its rsm remote surveillance module 
the rsm module enables real time remote video monitoring over pots lines 
the target market for video monitoring is primarily owners of small businesses such as convenience stores and restaurants who need the ability to view their premises from any remote location in the world at any time 
the company currently sells its rsm product to security distributors and dealers in north america  and is attempting to expand its distribution channels into europe and asia 
in december  the company introduced a new semiconductor product  the audacity internet telephony processor  which combines telephony protocols with audio compression decompression algorithms and implements multiple  simultaneous internet protocol phone calls on a single integrated circuit 
in april  the company announced its symphony voip module  an integrated system product that is based on the audacity semiconductor and that connects up to four analog telephone lines to an ip network 
these products reflect the company s recent efforts to develop broadband telephony technology 
to date the company has not realized any revenue from its products focused on the ip telephony market 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto revenues year ended march  in millions product revenues license and other revenues this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations

total revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
total revenues for fiscal were divided among multimedia communication semiconductors million  viatv systems million  video monitoring systems million and nonrecurring license and other revenues million 
in fiscal  total revenues were divided among multimedia communications semiconductors million  viatv systems million and nonrecurring license and other revenues million 
in fiscal  total revenues were divided between semiconductors million  viatv systems  and nonrecurring license and other revenues million 
product revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in sales of the company s multimedia communication semiconductors  partially offset by an increase in sales of the company s viatv and video monitoring system products 
in fiscal  product revenues increased by million above the million reported in fiscal the increase in product revenues is primarily due to sales generated from the company s viatv products  combined with an increase in sales of the company s multimedia communication semiconductors  offset by a decrease in both mpeg semiconductor and math co processor sales due to the discontinuation of such product lines in fiscal license and other revenues consist of technology licenses  including royalties required under such licenses  and nonrecurring engineering fees for services performed by the company for its customers 
license and other revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million reported in fiscal  due in part to the approximately million paid by com in fiscal for a license to substantially all of the company s technology underlying its viatvs 
compared to fiscal  in fiscal license and other revenues increased by million from million to million  due in part to the million paid by com in fiscal revenues from the company s ten largest customers in the fiscal years ended march   and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of its total revenues 
during the year ended march   no customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
com accounted for during the year ended march   and ascii  the company s former distributor in japan  accounted for during the year ended march  sales to customers outside the united states represented  and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
specifically  the company s sales to the asia pacific region represented  and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the company s sales to europe represented  and of total revenues for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
cost of revenues year ended march  in millions cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues cost of license and other revenues as a percentage of license and other revenues the cost of product revenues consists of costs associated with components  semiconductor wafer fabrication  system and semiconductor assembly and testing performed by third party vendors and direct and indirect costs associated with purchasing  scheduling and quality assurance 
costs of product revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
in fiscal  cost of product revenues included a million charge associated with the write off of inventories related to the company s decision to cease production and distribution of its viatv product line 
in addition  increased costs associated with increased viatv videophone revenues were partially offset by decreased cost of shipments of the company s multimedia communication semiconductor products 
the cost of product revenues for the viatv and video monitoring products is substantially greater as a percentage of related revenues as compared to the company s multimedia semiconductor products 
the cost of product revenues in fiscal year included costs associated with increasing shipments of its viatv videophone products 
in fiscal  cost of product revenues included a million charge associated with the write off of inventories related to the company s discontinuation of the mpeg product line in september as a result of this write off  costs for the period increased and were equal to of product revenue 
cost of license  and other revenues was  and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
in fiscal cost of license and other revenues consisted of personnel and other costs incurred to perform certain development work under terms of a nonrecurring engineering contract between the company and one of its customers 
there were no costs associated with license and other revenues in the fiscal year ended march  gross profit year ended march  in millions gross profit as a percentage of total revenues total gross profit was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit from product revenues was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
gross profit from license and other revenues  all of which were nonrecurring was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit and margin from product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the decrease in multimedia communication semiconductor revenues and to the million write off of inventories due to the company s decision to cease production and distribution of its viatv videophone product line 
the increase in gross profit and margin from product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the increase in multimedia communication semiconductor revenues in fiscal and to lower revenues and charges associated with the write off of inventories related to the company s exit from the mpeg semiconductor market in fiscal the company s gross margin is affected by a number of factors including  product mix  the recognition of license and other revenues for which there may be no or little corresponding cost of revenues  product pricing  the allocation between international and domestic sales  the percentage of direct sales and sales to resellers  and manufacturing and component costs 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by falling average selling prices 
the company expects that  as a result of competitive pressures and other factors  gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the company s multimedia communication semiconductor products will likely decrease for the foreseeable future 
because the market is emerging  the average selling price for broadband telephony semiconductors is uncertain 
the company may not be able to attain asps similar to those of its historical videoconferencing semiconductors 
if asps are lower  gross margins will be lower than the company s historical gross margins  unless costs for broadband telephony semiconductors are also proportionately lower 
in addition  the gross margins for the company s video monitoring products are  and will continue to be  substantially lower than the gross margins for its semiconductors 
in the likely event that the company encounters significant price competition in the markets for its products  the company could be at a significant disadvantage compared to its competitors  many of which have substantially greater resources  and therefore may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure 
this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations

research and development expenses year ended march  in millions research and development as a percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  system prototype design and fabrication  mask  prototype wafer and equipment costs necessary for the company to conduct its development efforts 
research and development costs  including software development costs  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  research and development expenses were concentrated on multimedia communication semiconductors and viatv and video monitoring systems products 
in addition  in fiscal the company s research and development costs also included costs associated with the development of the audacity internet telephony processor  and the symphony voip module 
lower research and development expenses during fiscal were due to decreases in profit sharing and incentive bonuses  non recurring viatv and video monitoring system design costs  and costs associated with materials and tooling used in prototype builds of the company s viatv and video monitoring system products 
during fiscal  research and development costs would have been higher  except that certain research and development personnel performed non recurring engineering services under a revenue generating contract 
the costs associated with this contract were included in the cost of license and other revenues 
higher research and development costs as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal were due to lower revenues as compared to fiscal the non cash compensation expense recognized on certain stock option grants and charged to research and development decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and million in fiscal the company expects to continue to allocate substantial resources to research and development 
however  future research and development costs may vary both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended march  in millions selling  general and administrative as a percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources and general management 
such costs also include advertising  sales commissions  trade show and other marketing and promotional expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  expenses increased due to costs associated with the marketing  advertising and promotion of the company s viatv videophone product line  additional headcount required to support these activities  and expenses associated with the company s implementation of a new enterprise wide database and information management system 
these increases were substantially offset by decreases in profit sharing and incentive bonuses  and commission expenses 
compared to fiscal  in fiscal selling general and administrative this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations 
see manufacturing commencing on page  competition commencing on page and factors that may affect future results commencing on page for a discussion of certain factors that could affect future performance 
expenses increased by million due to additional headcount  higher compensation costs and costs associated with the marketing  advertising and promotion of the company s viatv videophone product line 
in april  the company announced that it would cease production of the viatv videophone product line and withdraw from its distribution channels over the next several quarters 
as a result  the company expects decreases in the expenses associated with promoting the viatv videophone product line 
however  the company will likely need to increase sales and marketing personnel to support the ip telephony and video monitoring markets 
as a result  future selling  general and administrative costs may vary both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
the non cash compensation expense recognized on certain stock option grants and charged to selling  general and administrative decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and million in fiscal other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest earned on cash equivalents and short term investments 
in fiscal  and  other income  net  was approximately million  million   respectively 
compared to fiscal  the decrease in interest income earned in fiscal is due primarily to lower average cash equivalents and short term investment balances as compared to fiscal benefit provision for income taxes there was no tax provision for the year ended march  due to the net losses incurred 
the tax benefit for the year ended march  resulted from the reversal of approximately million of the company s income tax liability in the first quarter of fiscal upon notice from the internal revenue service that it had reversed a previously asserted deficiency related to the taxable year at march   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates beginning in in addition  at march   the company had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million which begin expiring in under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march   the company had deferred tax assets of approximately million 
the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to realize its deferred tax assets and thus a full valuation reserve has been recorded at march  year many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
as the year approaches  these code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish years beginning with from those beginning with the company is assessing the readiness of its products  internal computer systems  and third party equipment and software utilized by the company to handle year issues 
based upon the company s assessments  all of the company s products are year compliant 
with regard to the company s internal computer systems  the company completed its implementation of an enterprise wide database and information management system that is year compliant during the quarter ended march  the total cost of the system implementation project was approximately million 
the company does not believe that the incremental project cost this statement is a forward looking statement reflecting current expectations 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual future performance will meet the company s current expectations 
see manufacturing commencing on page  competition commencing on page and factors that may affect future results commencing on page for a discussion of certain factors that could affect future performance 
associated with year compliance was material as the feature is included with a system purchased by the company to satisfy its business needs 
as such  the company has not allocated any portion of the total project cost to the year issue 
the company is also assessing the possible effects on the company s operations of the year readiness of key customers  subcontract manufacturers  component suppliers and other providers of goods and services to the company 
the company expects that this assessment  as well as related remediation and contingency planning activities  will be on going throughout calendar year failure to address year issues by the company s customers  subcontract manufacturers  component suppliers  and other providers of goods and services could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and operating results 
the total estimated cost to be incurred by the company regarding the testing of current products for year compliance  and answering and responding to customer requests related to year issues  including both incremental spending and redeployed resources  is currently not expected to exceed  the total cost estimate does not include costs of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
in some instances  the installation schedule of new software and hardware in the normal course of business is being accelerated to also afford a solution to year compliance issues 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of key customers  subcontract manufacturers  component suppliers and other partners providing goods and services to the company  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year related interruptions or failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
to attempt to mitigate the impact of year related risks  the company has begun development of contingency plans which will include  for example  attempting to identify alternative vendors of critical materials and services in the event of a year related disruption in supply 
contingency planning will continue through at least calendar  and will depend heavily on responses received from current vendors and customers regarding their year readiness 
however  even if the company  in a timely manner  develops contingency plans believed to be adequate  some problems may not be identified or corrected in time to prevent material adverse consequences to the company 
additionally  if the company fails to satisfactorily resolve year issues in a timely manner  it could be exposed to claims by third parties 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company had cash and liquid investments totaling million  representing a decrease of million from march  the company currently has no bank borrowing arrangements 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in accounts payable of  cash used in operations was partially offset by cash provided by a decrease in inventory of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  and noncash items  including a deferred compensation charge of  and depreciation and amortization of  cash used in investing activities in fiscal is primarily attributable to capital expenditures of million and the repurchase of common stock from minority shareholders of a subsidiary of the company in conjunction with its merger with the company in august cash flows from financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of net proceeds from the repayment of stockholders notes receivable and sales of the company s common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
for the year  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million

for the year  cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
cash used in operations was partially offset by cash provided by decreases in inventory and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  and noncash items  including a deferred compensation charge of million and depreciation and amortization of  cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was primarily attributable to net sales of short term investments of million which was offset by capital expenditures of approximately  cash flows from financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from the sales of convertible noncumulative preferred stock and sales of common stock upon the exercise of stock options  respectively 
for the year  cash and cash equivalents increased by million 
the company believes that it will be able to fund planned expenditures and satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months from cash flow from operations  if any  and existing cash balances 
as of march   the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
however  the company currently estimates that it will be required to raise additional financing at some point during calendar year the company will be evaluating financing alternatives prior to that time 
there also can be no assurance that the company will not seek to exploit business opportunities that will require it to raise additional capital from equity or debt sources to finance its growth and capital requirements 
in particular  the development and marketing of new products could require a significant commitment of resources  which could in turn require the company to obtain additional financing earlier than otherwise expected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional financing as needed on acceptable terms or at all
