overview general rational s revenues are derived from product license fees and charges for services  including technical consulting  training  and customer support 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  rational software license revenues are generally recognized when a customer purchase order has been received and accepted  the software product has been shipped  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
for customer license agreements that meet these recognition criteria  the portion of the fees related to software licenses will generally be recognized in the current period  while the portion of the fees related to services is recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from consulting and training are recognized when earned 
rational s license agreements do not provide a right of return  and reserves are maintained for potential credit losses  of which there have been only immaterial amounts

although rational has experienced increasing revenues in each of the past five fiscal years  rational s sales compensation structure has historically contributed to revenues for the first quarter of a fiscal year being lower than revenues for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that rational will continue to experience increasing revenues or that similar fluctuations will not occur again in the future

fiscal years ended march    and revenues total revenues increased in fiscal compared with fiscal and in fiscal compared with fiscal net product revenues 
net product revenues increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal this increase is a result of continued strong customer acceptance of the company s existing products  including products for requirements management  modeling  testing  change and configuration management  the introduction of the rational suite family of products  and the year to year increase in sales capacity 
net product revenues in fiscal was flat compared with fiscal the flat net product revenues in fiscal when compared with were due to several factors surrounding the merger and acquisition activities of the company 
these factors include disruption in the field sales organization caused by territory realignment and new product training  conforming business practices  conforming product packaging  and pricing

international sales 
during fiscal   and  international revenues from product sales and related consulting and customer support were million  million  and million  representing   and of total revenues  respectively 
the growth in international sales during was due principally to increased sales and marketing activities in international markets 
the company s international sales are principally priced in local currencies 
the company enters into short term forward currency contracts to hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on balance sheet exposures denominated in currencies other than the local  or functional  currency of the company or its subsidiaries 
the total amount of these contracts is approximately offset by the underlying assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and such contracts are carried at fair market value 
the associated gains and losses were not material to the company s results of operations in any period presented 
see factors that may affect future results rules associated with international operations  limited protection of intellectual property 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues consists principally of materials  packaging and freight  amortization of purchased technology  and royalties 
cost of product revenues increased in fiscal compared with fiscal and in fiscal compared with fiscal these costs represented   and of net product revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  the decrease in product cost as a percentage of product revenues was due primarily to better economies of scale on materials and packaging and freight with respect to certain products as a result of increased volume 
in fiscal  the increase in product cost as a percentage of product revenues was due primarily to amortization of developed technology acquired in mergers 
see factors that may affect future results dependence on sales force and other channels of distribution 
cost of consulting and support revenues 
cost of consulting and support revenues consists principally of personnel costs for training  consulting  and customer support 
cost of consulting and support revenues decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal and increased in fiscal compared with fiscal these costs represented   and of consulting and support revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
in fiscal  the decrease in cost and cost as a percentage of related revenues is primarily due to changes to the company s customer support business model as a result of combining the pure atria and rational service organizations  combined with the impact of a relatively fixed support cost base servicing increased revenues 
in fiscal  the increase in dollar amounts was the result of additional personnel and personnel related expenses needed to perform professional services in object modeling  advanced software development practices  and business process engineering 
the cost decreases as a percentage of consulting and support revenues resulted from an overall higher mix of customer support services  which generally have a higher gross margin than consulting services 
operating expenses research and development 
total expenditures for research and development increased in fiscal compared with fiscal and in fiscal compared with fiscal research and development costs represented   and of total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increases in fiscal as compared with fiscal  and in fiscal as compared with fiscal  were due primarily to the cost of additional personnel and related costs incurred in maintaining existing products and developing new product releases 
see factors that may affect future results rapid technological change 
rational did not capitalize any software development costs in fiscal   and because eligible costs were not material 
rational expects that the amount of software development costs capitalized in future periods will be immaterial to rational s results of operations and financial position because the time period and the engineering effort required between demonstration of a product s economic and technological feasibility and the date of product release has been very short

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared with fiscal and in fiscal compared with fiscal these expenses represented   and of total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
the fiscal and increases in sales and marketing expenses reflect the additional personnel  commissions  and related costs required in sales and marketing departments to expand rational s sales channels  to penetrate new markets  and to increase its market share in core markets 
the fiscal increase over fiscal also included expenses associated with the merger with pure atria 
see factors that may affect future results dependence on sales force and other channels of distribution 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared with fiscal and in fiscal compared with fiscal general and administrative expenses represented   and of total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increases resulted from increased employee related expenses associated with staffing requirements needed to support the company s expanding business 
while general and administrative expenses have decreased as a percentage of total revenue in each of the last two years  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue

charges for acquired in process research and development 
in process research and development represents the present value of the estimated cash flow expected to be generated by acquired technology that at the acquisition date has not yet reached the point of technological feasibility and does not have an alternative future use 
in fiscal  write offs associated with acquired in process research and development included million related to the acquisition of the visual test product  million related to the acquisition of requisite  inc  million related to the acquisition of softlab ab  and million related to the acquisition of performance awareness corporation 
see factors that may affect future results risks associated with acquisitions 
merger and integration costs 
in fiscal  the company substantially completed certain elements of the organizational integrations following the july pure atria merger 
this consisted primarily of exiting certain nonstrategic consulting activities  realignment of marketing activities and consolidation of certain sales offices 
in the december quarter  charges related to this activity  totaling approximately million  were primarily for severance costs associated with employee terminations  and charges associated with facilities closures 
these charges were offset by a reduction of previously accrued facilities expenses related to the pure atria merger totaling million 
the facilities expense reduction was due to greater than expected recoveries from subleasing 
the net impact in fiscal was a merger and integration cost reduction of million 
the net cost reduction of million is the result of ongoing assessment and estimation of costs associated with the prior combinations of rational and other companies 
such assessment will continue until all related costs are incurred or determinable 
in fiscal  merger related expenses of million were recorded related to the merger of rational and pure atria to accrue transaction costs  severance costs associated with employee terminations  costs associated with conforming employee benefits plans  charges associated with the closure of duplicate facilities  and asset writedowns related to duplicate business systems 
in fiscal  merger related expenses of million and million were recorded related to the mergers of pure and atria  and rational and sqa  respectively 
the actions related to severance and administrative costs are substantially complete

visual test acquisition 
in october  rational and microsoft announced the formation of a business alliance that consisted of rational s acquisition of microsoft s visual test product  technology cross licensing  joint development projects  and joint marketing programs 
the purchase price of the visual test product consisted of a single million cash payment 
rational s operating results for the quarter ended december   were reduced by a nonrecurring charge of million associated with the acquisition of the visual test product 
the charge to operations for acquired in process research and development represented the present value of the estimated cash flow expected to be generated by visual test related technology  which at the acquisition date had not yet reached the point of technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use 
other income  net other income  net  consists of interest income  interest expense  gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and miscellaneous items of income and expense 
other income has fluctuated as a result of operating results  the amount of cash available for investment in interest bearing accounts  and the extent of foreign currency transactions 
other income  net  decreased million to million in fiscal and increased million to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is due primarily to a lower average amount of invested cash resulting from repurchase of company common stock and to declining interest rates 
the increase in fiscal is due primarily to interest earned on cash generated from secondary public offerings completed by rational  which were completed in october and june  and from the initial public offering completed by sqa  inc  in december see factors that may affect future results fluctuations in operating results 
income taxes the income tax provisions for fiscal  and differ from tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due to the impact of nondeductible charges for acquired in process research and development and merger related costs  foreign losses resulting in no us tax benefit  as well as foreign and state income taxes  offset by the realized benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards 
as of march   rational had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in years through the company also had tax credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  that expire in years through  if not utilized 
as a result of various public offerings and business combinations  the company and some of its acquired entities experienced an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
due to the passing of time  the company s net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are no longer subject to limitation

fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
fas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based on the weight of available evidence  the company has provided a valuation allowance against certain tax credit carryforwards and the future amortization of certain intangible assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis

net cash provided by operating activities for the period ended march   was composed primarily of net income plus noncash charges for depreciation and amortization  tax benefits from employee stock plans  increases in income taxes payable and deferred revenues  and a decrease in noncash merger and integration liabilities 
these were offset primarily by a decrease in accrued merger and integration expenses and increases in accounts receivable  deferred tax assets  and prepaid expenses 
total cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments for the period ended march   was million  and working capital was million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the period ended march   was composed primarily of noncash charges for depreciation and amortization and an increase in accrued merger and integration costs  deferred revenues  and income taxes payable offset by the company s net loss and increases in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses  and deferred tax assets 
net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from net purchases and maturities and sales of short term investments of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal and expenditures for fixed assets of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used for business and product acquisitions totaled million in fiscal and million in see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from million used to repurchase common stock and million used to decrease long term debt  offset by million received from issuance of common stock under the employee stock plans 
in fiscal financing activities generated million  of which million was received from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of common stock options and million was used to decrease long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in fiscal financing activities generated million  of which approximately million was generated by the public offering of the company s common stock in october also  the company received net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock plans 
in april the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock in the open market to be used for general corporate purposes 
the company completed that repurchase program during the september quarter 
in october  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase an additional million shares of its common stock in the open market to be used for general corporate purposes 
through march   the company had repurchased a total of million shares of its common stock  including repurchases authorized in april and october  for a total cash outlay of approximately million 
repurchases helped offset dilution from stock issued under the company s stock option and stock purchase plans 
the company believes that expected cash flow from operations combined with existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future

year readiness disclosure the company is aware of the problems associated with computer systems as the year approaches 
year problems are the result of common computer programming techniques that result in systems that do not function properly when manipulating dates later than december  the problem may affect internal information technology it systems used by the company for product development  accounting  distribution  and planning 
the problem may also affect non it embedded systems such as building security systems  machine controllers  and other equipment 
the company established a year project team to develop and implement a comprehensive four phase year readiness plan for its worldwide operations relating to the company s software products  the company s internal it and non it systems and third party customers  vendors  and others with whom the company does business 
phase one inventory consisted of identifying all the company s systems  relationships  and products that may be impacted by year phase two assessment involved determining the company s current state of year readiness for those areas identified in the inventory phase and prioritizing the areas that need to be fixed 
phase three remediation consisted of developing a plan for those areas identified as needing correction in the assessment phase 
phase four implementation consists of executing the action plan and completing the steps identified to attain year readiness 
with respect to its software products  the company has completed the inventory  assessment  remediation  and implementation phases of the plan in the course of developing new products and product upgrades  all of which have been designed to be year compliant 
accordingly  the company does not currently sell or support any products that are not year compliant 
the company did not separately track the internal costs of the research and development efforts related to making its products year compliant  and such costs were principally composed of salaries and benefits of software engineering personnel 
the company funded these research and development costs out of operating cash flows 
with respect to its most critical internal it systems  consisting of accounting  data processing  and other systems  the company has completed the inventory  assessment  remediation  and implementation phases in the course of introducing new systems and system upgrades to support the company s recent rapid growth  including growth through acquisitions 
no such system implementations were undertaken or accelerated for the sole purpose of becoming year compliant  and it is not practicable to identify any incremental costs related to year compliance involved in these system implementations 
as an additional precautionary measure  the company plans to conduct parallel testing of the primary accounting and sales tracking systems in the three months ending september  with respect to noncritical it systems  consisting primarily of security systems  fax machines and other miscellaneous systems  and non it embedded systems  the company has completed the inventory and assessment phases and is currently executing the remediation and implementation phases 
the company does not anticipate any material costs for completing the remediation and implementation phases with respect to these noncritical it and non it embedded systems 
the company currently expects to fund all remediation and implementation costs from operating cash flows and has not established any specific reserves for these costs 
the company plans to complete all material remediation of year systems by september the company has not yet incurred any material costs specifically related to becoming year compliant in its noncritical it and non it embedded systems 
as with critical it systems  discussed above  many of the company s noncritical it systems have been replaced or upgraded to accommodate expanded business processes due to recent growth and merger activity 
no such system implementations were undertaken or accelerated for the sole purpose of becoming year compliant 
the company has completed the inventory phase of determining the year readiness of its significant suppliers  subcontractors  and customers that do not share information systems with the company  and has queried such third parties about their year readiness 
the company has no means of ensuring that these third parties will be year ready 
based on information currently available to the company  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios with respect to the company relate to the potential failure of third party suppliers  subcontractors  and customers to become year compliant and  to a lesser extent  the company s potential failure to reach year compliance with respect to noncritical it and non it embedded systems 
the inability of suppliers  subcontractors  and customers to complete their year remediation processes in a timely fashion could result in delays in introducing new products  reduced sales of new or existing products  and disruptions in strategic relationships  which could in turn have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the effect of noncompliance by suppliers  subcontractors  and customers is not reasonably quantifiable 
while the company expects to attain year readiness with respect to noncritical it and non it embedded systems  there is no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to identify and address all year system issues on time 
failure to do so may adversely impact the company s results of operations or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors  or others 
for example  failure to achieve year readiness could delay the company s ability to produce and ship products  invoice customers  and collect payments  and could disrupt customer service  technical support  and facilities 
the company could suffer increased costs  lost sales  or other negative consequences resulting from customer dissatisfaction  including litigation 
failures of security systems relying on non it embedded systems could compromise the company s operations or ability to safeguard proprietary information 
the company is currently evaluating year related contingency plans 
the company plans to complete contingency planning with respect to noncritical it and non it embedded systems by september the above discussion regarding costs  risks  and estimated completion dates for the year is based on the company s best estimates given information that is currently available  and is subject to change 
there can be no assurance that actual costs will not substantially exceed the company s assessment due to internal year problems or year problems associated with the company s it and non it systems and products 
in addition  while the company believes it has achieved year compliance with respect to its software products and critical it systems  there could be unanticipated year related failures in such products or systems that could have a material and adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
further  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be remediated in a timely manner  or that a failure to remediate by another company  including without limitation any of the company s vendors  customers  or partners  or a remediation that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in known or forecasted currency exchange rates 
foreign currency risk a portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative to the local or functional currency of the company or its subsidiaries may adversely effect operating results 
the company enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts designed to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on balance sheet exposures denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the total amount of these contracts is approximately offset by the underlying assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies 
forward contracts are accounted for on a mark to market basis with realized and unrealized gains or losses recognized in the period in which they are incurred 
such contracts meet the criteria established in fasb for hedge accounting treatment 
as the company finds it impractical to hedge all foreign currency exposures  the company will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does it hold or issue leveraged derivative financial instruments 
at march  and  the company had outstanding forward exchange contracts  all having maturities of less than days  to exchange various nonfunctional currencies for us dollars or dutch guilders in the aggregate amounts us dollar equivalent of million and million  respectively 
the net gains and losses associated with all forward exchange contracts in fiscal   and are not material to the company s results of operations 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
all the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value based on quoted market prices at march  and unrecognized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in other income 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
realized gains and losses on sales of available for sale securities were immaterial for the years ended march  and there were no significant unrealized holding gains or losses on such securities at march  and
