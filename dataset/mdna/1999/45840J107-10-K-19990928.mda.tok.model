this agreement also restricts the payment of dividends to dbc s stockholders and limits the purchase of treasury stock 
at june   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
management believes that the cash generated by operating activities  together with its existing cash and financing facilities  are sufficient to meet the short and long term needs of the current operations of the company 
business development and outlook during  the company s main development efforts were to increase the markets for esignal and insite 
the purchase of the gtis business helped to expand the company s institutional market presence 
demand for financial market information is largely dependent upon activity levels in the securities markets 
in the event that the us financial markets were to experience a prolonged period of investor inactivity in trading securities  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the degree of such consequences is uncertain 
income taxes under current accounting requirements  the company recognizes future tax benefits or expenses attributable to its temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
recognition of deferred tax assets is subject to the company s determination that realization is more likely than not 
as of june   the company has recorded  of net deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance of  and deferred tax liabilities of  based on taxable income projections  management believes that the recorded net deferred tax assets will be realized 
inflation although management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of its operations during the past three years  there can be no assurance that the company s results of operations will not be affected by inflation in the future 
year the company has substantially completed a comprehensive review of its products  information systems and critical suppliers to identify those that may be affected by the year yk issue 
the company s yk status is as follows most of the company s products and networks are substantially yk compliant already 
however  there is one older product with a small number of subscribers that is not yk compliant and will not be supported beyond december  the company has informed those customers affected and will try to meet the customers needs with another dbc product 
the company has sought compliance statements from each of its significant suppliers  most of which have provided positive assurances regarding their compliance 
dbc will continue to work with those who are not yet yk compliant 
in the normal course of business  the company is replacing its administrative systems for accounting  billing and customer management 
the new systems will be fully yk compliant and will cost approximately  most of which will be capitalized as fixed assets 
at june   approximately  has been capitalized 
these costs were capitalized because they related to the implementation of new systems which include substantial new functionality in addition to being yk compliant 
all historical and future costs have been and will continue to be funded out of existing cash and cash flows from operations 
the company has developed certain contingency options that are available in the event of a yk failure 
for example  if any of the satellites that are used by dbc s financial network were to fail  it is possible that the company could shift all of its satellite customers to its internet based products 
in another example  if one data provider fails  it is possible that there is another data provider that provides substantially similar information that could be integrated into dbc s data feed 
there are certainly no foolproof contingency plans that cover every possible failure 
however  the company will continue to develop potential solutions so that it is as prepared as possible in the event of a failure 
in addition  the company will continue to work with its insurers so that it effectively manages its financial risk in the event of a business interruption 
based upon currently available information  management has no reason to believe that the company will not meet its compliance goals and does not anticipate that the cost of effecting yk compliance will have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
nevertheless  achieving yk compliance is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not completely within the company s control 
should either the company s internal systems or the internal systems of one or more of its critical vendors fail to achieve yk compliance  the company s business and its results of operations could be adversely affected 
forward looking statements from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  research and development activities and similar matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may effect the operations  performance  development and results of the company s business include the following the presence of competitors with greater financial resources and their strategic response to the company s new services 
the acceptance of the internet as a reliable real time distribution platform by institutional customers 
the ability of the company to broaden its subscriber base by adding more individual investors outside of the company s traditional active trader market 
the company s failure  or the failure of material third parties  to complete their year compliance plan on a timely basis 
the potential obsolescence of the company s services due to the introduction of new technologies 
activity levels in the securities markets
