item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of economy and shift in customer demand during fiscal  primarily due to continued improved domestic economic conditions  there was a higher demand for our standby power products sold by the powercom division 
in the telecommunications market  continued growth in demand was reflected by the growth in sales of our flooded batteries 
international economic conditions have had a negative impact on our international sales during fiscal raw material pricing and productivity lead  steel  copper  plastics and electronic components are the major raw materials used in the manufacture of our industrial batteries and electronics products and  accordingly  represent a significant portion of our materials costs 
during fiscal  and  the average north american producer price of lead has been  
and 
lb  respectively 
we have a long term cost containment program to maximize manufacturing efficiency 
the program continues to allocate a significant amount of our normal annual capital expenditures to cost containment and productivity improvement projects 
inflation the costs to us of manufacturing materials and labor and most other operating costs are affected by inflationary pressures 
our ability to pass along inflationary cost increases through higher prices may be limited during periods of stable or declining lead prices because of industry pricing practices that tend to link product prices and lead prices 
we believe that  over recent years  we have been able to offset inflationary cost increases by o effective raw materials purchasing programs  o price increases of our products  o increases in labor productivity  and o improvements in overall manufacturing efficiency 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items in c d s consolidated statements of income as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal increased  or two percent to  from  in fiscal this was a result of an increase in sales by the powercom and motive power divisions  up nine percent and four percent  respectively  partially offset by a percent decrease in sales by the power electronics division 
the increase in powercom divisional sales was primarily due to higher sales to the telecommunications and control markets in fiscal versus the prior year 
power electronics divisional sales were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower power conversion sales to both the telecommunications and non telecommunications markets 
power electronics telecommunications sales were lower in fiscal due to lower sales of cellular phone battery chargers 
we expect these lower sales volumes of cellular phone battery chargers to continue into the first half of fiscal on a company wide basis  telecommunications related sales were approximately percent of total c d sales during fiscal versus percent in fiscal gross profit for fiscal increased  or six percent to  from  in the prior year  resulting in a gross margin of percent versus percent in the prior fiscal year 
gross margin increased as a result of improved gross margin in the powercom division due to lower material costs and improved operating efficiencies  as well as improved motive power divisional gross margin related to lower material costs 
power electronics divisional gross margin decreased in fiscal versus the prior year primarily as a result of lower sales volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or three percent over the prior year due to higher selling expenses  partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses 
selling expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal due to higher commission expenses and higher payroll and new motive power divisional sales branch location related costs 
general and administrative expenses were lower in fiscal compared to the prior year due to the absence in fiscal of costs related to the accelerated write off of goodwill and intangible assets associated with lh due to impairment that occurred in fiscal  lower costs associated with the resolution of legal disputes and lower consulting costs 
research and development expenses remained proportional to sales as a relative percentage for both fiscal and at approximately percent of sales 
operating income increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a result of higher powercom divisional operating income  flat motive power divisional operating income and lower power electronics divisional operating income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our power electronics division incurred an operating loss 
this situation is expected to continue at least through the first quarter of fiscal interest expense  net  decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances during fiscal other expense  net  decreased  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the absence in the current year of amortization expense associated with the write off of capitalized debt acquisition costs related to our credit facility and the development authority of rockdale county industrial revenue bonds 
also contributing to this decrease was higher purchase price discounts in fiscal versus the prior year and a lower foreign exchange loss in fiscal compared to fiscal income tax expense increased  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to higher levels of income before income taxes 
as a result of the above  for fiscal  net income rose percent from fiscal to  or per common share basic and per common share assuming dilution 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal increased  or seven percent to  from  in fiscal this was primarily the result of an increase in sales by the powercom and power electronics divisions  up nine percent and percent  respectively 
sales by the motive power division remained flat in fiscal compared to the prior year 
a portion of the fiscal sales increase of the power electronics division resulted from the recording of a full year s sales versus a partial year in fiscal due to the acquisition of a power conversion company during the first quarter of fiscal the increase in the powercom divisional sales was primarily due to higher sales to the telecommunications and ups markets in fiscal versus fiscal  partially offset by lower government and control sales 
sales by the power electronics division increased due to higher power conversion sales to both the telecommunications primarily cellular phone battery chargers and non telecommunications markets 
on a company wide basis  telecommunications related sales were approximately percent of total company sales during fiscal versus percent in fiscal gross profit for fiscal increased  or percent to  from  in the prior fiscal year  resulting in a gross margin of percent versus percent in the prior year 
gross margin increased as a result of improved gross margin in the powercom division due to lower material costs and operating efficiencies associated with higher sales volumes 
gross margins of the motive power and power electronics divisions were up slightly in fiscal versus selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or percent over the prior year primarily as a result of the accelerated write off of goodwill and intangible assets associated with lh due to impairment  higher payroll related costs  warranty  due diligence costs  and the resolution of legal disputes  partially offset by lower variable selling expense 
research and development expense remained proportional to sales as a relative percentage for both fiscal and fiscal at approximately three percent of sales 
operating income increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a result of higher powercom and motive power divisional operating income  partially offset by lower power electronics divisional operating income 
the power electronics divisional operating income was negatively impacted by the accelerated write off of goodwill and intangible assets noted above 
interest expense  net  decreased percent from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to lower debt balances outstanding  partially offset by lower capitalized interest related to plant expansions and lower interest income 
other expense  net  increased  from fiscal to fiscal as a result of higher amortization expense associated with the write off of capitalized debt acquisition costs related to our credit facility and the development authority of rockdale county industrial revenue bonds 
this increase was also due to lower nonoperating income during fiscal coupled with a foreign exchange loss in fiscal versus a slight foreign exchange gain in fiscal income tax expense increased  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to higher levels of income before income taxes coupled with a smaller favorable tax effect from foreign operations 
as a result of the above  for fiscal  net income rose percent from fiscal to  or per common share basic and per common share assuming dilution  adjusted to reflect c d s two for one stock split  effected in the form of a stock dividend 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities decreased  or percent to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a larger increase in inventories in fiscal compared to fiscal  coupled with decrease in income taxes payable in fiscal versus an increase in the prior year 
these changes resulting in lower net cash provided by operations  were partially offset by higher net income in fiscal compared to fiscal  changes in timing differences affecting deferred taxes  and an increase in accounts payable in fiscal versus a decrease in the prior year 
the increase in inventory during fiscal was primarily related to our power electronics division 
net cash used by investing activities totaled  for fiscal  resulting in an increase of  or percent over the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to higher capital spending in fiscal versus fiscal net cash used by financing activities decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in net cash used by financing activities was primarily the result of lower net cash flows provided by operations and higher capital spending in fiscal compared to fiscal  coupled with a greater increase in cash balances in fiscal versus the prior year 
on march  we entered into a credit agreement in which the lenders named therein  and nationsbank  na as administrative agent  provided a  credit facility consisting of a term loan in the amount of  and a revolving loan not to exceed  the funds borrowed under this credit agreement were used to finance the acquisition of the specialty battery division of jci  to refinance existing debt and to finance working capital and certain other expenditures 
our availability under the current loan agreement is expected to be sufficient to meet our ongoing cash needs for working capital requirements  debt service  capital expenditures and possible strategic acquisitions 
capital expenditures during fiscal were incurred primarily to fund capacity expansion  new product development  a continuing series of cost reduction programs  normal maintenance capital  and regulatory compliance 
fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  for similar purposes  including capital requirements of the recently acquired special battery division from jci 
we have been notified that we are a potentially responsible party relating to various third party facilities see note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
readiness for year we are taking action to ensure that our operations will not be adversely affected by potential year computer failures and have developed a year readiness plan 
our chief financial officer is responsible for overseeing the execution of the plan and reports quarterly to our board of directors on the status of the year readiness plan 
the plan addresses the following four areas o information technology systems consisting of computer hardware and software related to the our business systems as well as our engineering and test equipment  o non information technology systems including embedded technology such as microcontrollers  which are typically found in such things as telephone systems  security systems  fax machines  etc  o products sold to customers  and o third party issues including significant suppliers and customers 
our year readiness plan generally includes the following phases for each of the four areas noted above o identification and risk assessment  o development and implementation of a remediation plan  o acceptance testing  and o contingency planning for high risk critical areas 
we have identified certain deficiencies related to our information technology systems and are in the process of addressing them through upgrades or other remediation 
we have two main computer systems that are utilized to run our business systems 
year remediation work on our business systems that run on our computer located in tucson  arizona has been completed and these business systems are now year compliant 
acceptance testing has been completed on our business systems that run on our computer located at our blue bell  pennsylvania headquarters 
these blue bell  pennsylvania business systems are expected to be year compliant in may in terms of non information technology systems  we have identified those items which may require remediation or replacement 
we are in the process of addressing those items and expect to complete remediation or replacement and testing by the middle of fiscal we have completed our assessment of year compliance with respect to our battery and electronics products that are currently being sold to customers and have concluded that all significant products are compliant 
with respect to third parties  we have identified and have been contacting our significant suppliers and will shortly begin to contact our major customers to determine the extent to which we may be vulnerable to such third parties failure to address their own year issues 
this process includes the solicitation of written responses to questionnaires and or meetings with certain of such third parties 
as a result  our assessment will be substantially dependent on information provided by third parties 
we have completed this initial notification and solicitation process with our significant suppliers and have now begun the next phase of re contacting those companies who have not responded 
we believe this process will continue through the second and third quarters of fiscal based upon our current estimates  total costs associated with our year compliance are expected to be immaterial 
the majority of these costs were incurred in fiscal and include third party consultants and programmers  remediation of existing software  and replacement or remediation of embedded chips 
such costs do not include internal management time  which is not expected to be material to our results of operations or financial condition 
we believe that our most significant risk with respect to year issues relates to the performance and readiness status of third parties 
as with all manufacturing companies  a reasonable worst case year scenario would be the result of failures of third parties including without limitation  governmental entities  utilities and entities with which we have no direct involvement that negatively impact our raw material supply chain or ability to provide products to customers or the ability of customers to purchase products  or events affecting regional  national or global economies generally 
the impact of these failures cannot be estimated at this time  however  we are considering contingency plans to limit  to the extent possible  the financial impact of these failures on our results of operations 
any such plans would necessarily be limited to matters over which we can reasonably control 
our year efforts are ongoing and our overall plan  as well as the consideration of contingency plans  will continue to evolve as new information becomes available 
while we anticipate continuity of our business activities  that continuity will be dependent upon our ability  and the ability of third parties with whom we rely on directly  or indirectly  to be year compliant 
conversion to the euro currency on january   the euro was adopted as the common legal currency  in coexistence with the national currencies for european union member nations until january  we have made all necessary adjustments to our processes to ensure compliance of all business transactional euro requirements during the three year transitional period that ends january  after this transitional period  the euro becomes the sole legal currency for the european union member nations and all of our records of the national currencies will be converted to the euro equivalent at that time 
we do not expect the euro adoption to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be charged to expense as incurred 
sop is effective for financial statements for years beginning after december  we believe that the adoption of sop will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes new procedures for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing standards 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we currently use derivatives such as interest rate swap agreements  currency swaps and currency forwards to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our floating rate debt and the exchange rate on canadian and mexican assets  liabilities and cash flows 
under current accounting standards  no gain or loss is recognized on changes in the fair value of these derivatives 
under this statement  gains or losses will be recognized based on changes in the fair value of the derivatives which generally occur as a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are currently evaluating the financial impact of adoption of this statement 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk factors we do not invest in derivative securities for trading purposes  but do enter into hedging arrangements in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the interest rates applicable to our long term debt and to fluctuations in the canadian dollar and mexican peso to the us dollar exchange rate 
our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of debt instruments and interest rate derivatives 
the net market value of our debt instruments was  and  at january  and january   respectively 
these instruments are subject to variable rate interest and therefore the market value is not sensitive to interest rate movements 
the net market value of our interest rate derivatives was and at january  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in rates at january  and would result in a and a increase in the market value  respectively 
a basis point decrease in rates at january  and would result in a and a decrease in the market value  respectively 
the above sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels  with all other variables held constant 
our financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forwards and swaps and represent a net asset position of and at january  and january   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables being held constant 
at january  and  a strengthening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar and the mexican peso would result in a change of the net asset position of the forward and swaps of a increase and a decrease  respectively 
at january  and  a weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar and the mexican peso would result in a decrease in the net asset position of the forward and swap of and an increase of  respectively 
foreign exchange forwards and swap contracts are used to hedge our firm and anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
there is either an asset or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis
