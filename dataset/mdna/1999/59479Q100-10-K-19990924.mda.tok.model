these market and economic conditions have adversely impacted the company s net sales and operating results for fiscal and late in fiscal  the market began to stabilize and show signs of a gradual recovery  which management believes will facilitate improved sales and operating results for the company in fiscal fiscal years ended june  and june  net sales

as detailed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  sales increased year over year in the far east  but decreased comparatively in the united states and europe 
the increase in shipments to the far east resulted primarily from increased business with several key and new customers in that region 
the decrease in sales in the united states and europe was primarily the result of the depressed market conditions 
the company expects sales to gradually improve with the anticipated recovery of the semiconductor capital equipment market in fiscal year  however  no assurance can be made that a sales increase will occur 
continued growth of the company s newer products are expected to generate the majority of the company s sales increase as customers are anticipated to continue to migrate to smaller devices and chip scale packages  and transition testing processes to strip  panel and wafer levels

though the line was unused at june   an increase in the interest rate could expose the company to market risk in the event the company is required to borrow under the line to finance its operations in the future

 reporting comprehensive income

sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet at their fair market value  and the corresponding derivative gains or losses be either reported in the statement of operations or as a deferred item depending on the type of hedge relationship that exists with respect to such derivative 
management has not yet completed an assessment of the impact of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
on the company s financial statements 
the standard is effective for the company in fiscal year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
when year begins  these computers may interpret as the year and could either stop processing date related computations or could process them incorrectly 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates to be year compliant 
the company completed a review of its internal information systems and determined that most of the application software and internal information systems  other than the company s primary manufacturing and accounting system are year compliant  can be upgraded to be year compliant without significant cost or effort  or  do not pose a significant issue to the company if left uncorrected 
with regard to the company s primary manufacturing and accounting system  the company contracted with the software vendor and related hardware supplier to bring these systems year compliant 
the upgrade was completed in the second quarter of fiscal all other significant application software  hardware and internal information systems which were identified as not year compliant have been upgraded or replaced 
total costs to upgrade the company s internal information systems  most of which have been paid  are not material to the operations of the company  and are expected to be less than  the company has completed an assessment of non it systems within the company to determine if they are year compliant 
the company has upgraded or replaced all significant non it systems that were identified as not year compliant 
although the company is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for the year  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in the technology used in its internal operating systems  which are composed predominately of third party software and hardware technology 
the company is in the process of determining the impact that third parties suppliers and vendors that are not year compliant may have on the operations of the company 
non compliance by any of the company s major distributors  suppliers  customers  vendors  or financial organizations could result in business disruptions that could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
to date  the company is not aware of any such third parties with year issues that would materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company plans on developing a contingency plan once it has completed its assessment of significant party compliance 
the contingency plan will be developed to minimize the company s exposure to work slowdowns or business disruptions and any adverse affects on the company s results of operations 
the company completed an assessment and test of the software components of its products for year compliance  and determined that no significant modifications are required to products currently offered or actively marketed within the past five years 
the company does not believe that its products contain undetected errors or defects associated with year date functions that may result in material costs to the company  including repair costs and costs incurred in litigation due to any such defects  however  there can be no assurance that such errors or defects do not exist 
many commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by claims related to year compliance
