item  management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition markets and marketing strategy markets the company principally markets its eas products and systems directly to retailers 
in many retail environments  the use of eas systems has become a standard operating practice because these products and systems have proven to be a cost effective method of reducing inventory shrinkage 
inventory shrinkage is often the second largest variable operating expense of retailers  after payroll costs  and normally ranges from to of sales 
eas products and systems help improve a retailer s profitability not only by reducing inventory shrinkage  but also by allowing the use of open merchandising which increases product accessibility to customers 
eas products and systems were first used by soft goods retailers to protect clothing 
due to technological advances  applications for hard goods merchandise non apparel merchandise have become economical and effective 
hard goods and food retailers  such as supermarkets  hypermarkets  home improvement centers  drug  mass merchandise  optical  music  hardware  book  video  and entertainment stores have increasingly become users of eas products and systems 
the company believes that it holds a significant market share of this worldwide eas market 
retailers also make extensive use of cctv products and systems to enhance security and the safety of their operations as well as access control systems 
several of the newer eas technologies used by retailers are used in commercial industrial markets to protect assets such as personal computers  facsimile and copy machines  telephones  artwork  limited access files and portable laboratory equipment and tools from loss by unauthorized removal 
other specialized applications include the protection of newborn infants in hospitals and patients in nursing homes and other long term care facilities 
c i installations of the company s cctv  access control and or asset management products and systems range from small to medium size businesses to large domestic and international operations and businesses 
the company sells its c i products and systems to end user customers primarily through an indirect network of dealers and distributors 
this network of dealers and distributors is global in scale and provides comprehensive coverage of the c i market worldwide 
the company engages in various direct advertising and marketing activities to stimulate demand for its products and partners with the dealers and distributors to fulfill the needs of end user customers 
the company has a broad range of electronic security products and systems  and the company s customers in general are increasingly receptive to the company s ability to design  supply  install and service integrated security systems that combine the technologies of the company s various products and systems 
the company s installed base of customers ie customers at which the company s products are installed includes a substantial majority of the top retailers in the world  as well as more than half of the global fortune companies 
marketing strategy the company s principal marketing strategies are as follows recurring label sales the sale of eas systems and devices to hard goods retailers has been growing significantly in recent years and the company believes that there is potential for continued growth 
hard goods merchandise is protected with labels which leave the store with the merchandise  representing a source of recurring revenues to the company 
labels may be self adhesive  stick on labels which are attached to merchandise by the retailer or applied at the point of manufacture or distribution 
source tagging the company has formed relationships with manufacturers  packaging companies and a number of its retail customers around the world  from virtually all retail segments including department stores  specialty apparel  discount  drug stores  hypermarkets  food  multi media  home improvement and automotive parts stores  to apply eas labels during manufacturing or packaging processes 
source tagging is intended to help retailers increase product sales and profitability through open merchandising and product exposure  reduced shrinkage  and reduced costs by eliminating the need for sales associates to apply security tags and labels to merchandise 
currently  nearly vendors in the us and approximately worldwide participate in source tagging with the company s eas technologies 
the company estimates that in fiscal  these suppliers provided us and international retailers with more than billion source tagged items  which represents of total company eas label sales 
source tagging programs are expected to grow at a rapid pace in fiscal the increased utilization of source tagging is expected to result in increased label sales and or royalty income as well as increased sales of systems and deactivators 
licensing label production the company has entered into license agreements with leading label producing companies to manufacture the company s ultra strip labels 
the company believes its licensing programs will allow it to gain efficiencies in label manufacturing  distribution and application for source tagging that are expected to reduce the overall cost of source tagging programs to retailers and suppliers as well as reduce the company s capital investment in label manufacturing 
this licensing is intended to provide customers with multiple sources of eas labels  and to increase the level of research and development resources directed to these technologies 
these programs are expected to result in a broader distribution of ultra strip labels and  therefore  facilitate the growth of ultra max technology  as well as allow sensormatic to focus on systems and security solutions 
royalty fees to be paid to the company based on sales generated by the licensees will provide recurring revenue to the company 
product choice the company s marketing and sales efforts are focused on offering choice to retailers recognizing that there are different technologies for different circumstances 
each technology has its advantages and disadvantages 
while ultra max is the newest and fastest growing technology with broad utilization  and the most often recommended by the company  the company offers a broad range of eas technologies in order to comply with the customer s choice 
commercial industrial market through its sales and marketing personnel dedicated to c i customers  the company intends to further gain market share in the expanding commercial industrial market 
c i sales personnel will continue to build the breadth and quality in its network of dealers and distributors to sell and market the company s broad portfolio of products 
in addition  the company plans to focus on improving levels of customer service and support to dealers and distributors 
the foundation of the company s c i strategy is to provide high value products that easily integrate to meet customer needs 
it is the company s objective to become the sought after provider of products and services for commercial industrial customers 
sales and service organization at june   the company employed approximately  sales and customer engineering personnel worldwide to market and service its products directly to retail and commercial industrial customers 
in addition  the company s products are marketed and serviced by a large network of sales and customer engineering personnel employed by dealers and distributors throughout the world 
sales and service personnel are directed from offices located throughout the us and in more than countries worldwide 
the company believes that a major factor in its success has been the high quality of its extensive and experienced sales and service organization 
the company has organized its sales force into specialized sales groups to market its systems to specific customer groups 
for example  in addition to its sales and marketing personnel dedicated to c i customers and the global source tagging division  retail specialized sales groups have been created to target the supermarket industry and key soft goods retailers in the us similar specialized sales groups  concentrating on self service stores and hypermarkets  have been formed in europe 
the company will continue to specialize its sales force and believes such specialization will accelerate its success in marketing to targeted user groups and provide improved customer service 
the company has an indirect sales force dedicated to c i customers which supports dealers and distributors in promoting the company s products and engages in national marketing 
backlog as of june  and june   the company had a backlog of orders of million and million  respectively 
backlog includes only expected revenues from firm orders which are expected to be installed or delivered within one year 
backlog at any time is not necessarily indicative of the level of business to be expected in the ensuing period 
seasonal aspect of the business although the business of the company is not necessarily seasonal  it has been the company s experience  with respect to its worldwide retail customers  that new orders and installations generally decrease during the december through february period 
the company believes this is attributable to the focus by retail store management on the holiday selling season and year end inventory analysis during this period 
additionally  the traditional european vacation period during the months of july and august results in a general decline of new orders and installations during this period 
patents and related rights as of june   the company owned or was the exclusive licensee of active patents issued by the us patent and trademark office as well as corresponding foreign patents 
these patents cover a variety of inventions and features  including the company s acousto magnetic ultra max  electromagnetic  microwave  swept rf systems and cctv systems 
the company had patent applications pending in the us for various other inventions relating to its products 
patents corresponding to many of the us patents have been issued or are pending in various foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that any patents will be issued to the company on any of its pending applications 
the company is also a non exclusive licensee under certain patents issued in the us and various foreign countries relating to the manufacture  use and sale of certain labels for use with its electromagnetic systems 
the company does not make any representation as to the scope  validity or value of any patents which have been or may be issued or licensed to it or as to the possible infringement by its products on patents owned by others 
although the company s patent program is important  the company believes that because of its technical knowledge and experience  the abilities of its established and experienced sales and service organization and its leadership position in the industry  it is not dependent upon patent protection to maintain its leadership in the electronic security industry 
supply chain operations and distribution the company s major production facilities are located in puerto rico  florida and ireland 
the company also has a manufacturing facility in brazil and does limited final assembly and testing at its san diego facility 
the puerto rico facility is the company s largest and accounts for two thirds of the company s manufacturing personnel 
the boca raton  florida facility specializes in eas label production 
the operation in cork  ireland allows the company to manufacture a wide range of products closer to its large european customer base 
fabrication of many of the c i products is sub contracted to local manufacturing facilities near the c i divisions located in massachusetts and california  while hard tag production is sub contracted to low cost  high quality suppliers in mexico and china 
the company s strategy is to maintain critical manufacturing processes in house and to form alliances with independent manufacturing partners to produce its products at the lowest possible cost 
this in house capability  combined with such alliances  provides control over costs and quality  while increasing responsiveness to the demands of the market which results in a distinct competitive advantage 
independent suppliers provide various component products and materials used to manufacture the company s products  and also manufacture certain component parts and label products to the company s specifications 
a core supplier base of approximately major suppliers  representing of purchasing dollars  has been established worldwide to maintain generally a reliable flow of quality materials at the lowest possible cost 
certain magnetic materials used in the manufacture of ultra max labels and tags are currently purchased from one supplier  vacuumschmelze gmbh vacuumschmelze 
while there are potential alternatives to the supply of such material by vacuumschmelze  the loss or disruption of this source of supply could result in increased costs or product shortages or otherwise materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company has been pursuing development of alternative materials for use in the company s ultra max labels and additional sources of supply 
the company has improved  and expects to continue to improve  its production efficiencies and cost structures through new processes  increased automation and improved product designs 
such improvements  particularly to increase capacity and lower product costs of eas products  have required additional capital investment for new production equipment 
the company s consolidation program for its warehousing and distribution locations  which commenced during fiscal year  will be completed during the first half of fiscal this consolidation strategy leverages the use of third party logistics service providers  enabling the company to capitalize on best in class logistics services and resources 
the number of warehouse locations has been reduced significantly during this timeframe 
competition the electronic security industry continues to be highly competitive 
there are many alternatives available to protect people and assets  in addition to the use of eas  cctv  and access control systems 
these alternatives include  among other things  guards and private detective services  mirrors  burglar alarms and other magnetic and electronic devices  and services combining some or all of the above elements 
to the company s knowledge  there are several other companies that market eas equipment to retail stores directly or through distributors  such as sentry technology corporation in the us  checkpoint systems  inc in the us  europe  latin america and asia and meto ae and nedap us in europe  all of which are principal competitors of the company 
with respect to cctv system components and access control systems  there are numerous companies  including philips  panasonic and pelco  that market directly or through distributors such equipment to both retail and non retail customers 
there are many competing companies in the sale of access control systems  including cardkey inc  westinghouse electronic corporation  northern computers inc 
and casi rusco inc the company competes in marketing its systems and products principally on the basis of product performance  multiple technologies  service and price 
price competition has been especially intense in some market segments in recent years 
there can be no assurance that other firms with greater financial and other resources may not enter into direct competition  or expand the scope of their existing competition  with the company  nor that new technologies will not be developed and introduced into the market place  which could adversely affect the company s business 
sales revenue direct sales and sales type leases the company s sales revenues are predominantly generated by direct sales and sales type leases of new products and systems 
additionally  the company generates sales revenues by export sales of new products and systems to distributors in foreign countries and through the sale of selected new equipment to dealers and system integrators 
the company sells its systems on a current  deferred or installment payment basis 
substantially all deferred payment obligations are payable within one year 
installment contract obligations are payable monthly over terms generally up to five years 
installment contract obligations are subject to stated or imputed interest at prevailing market rates and are generally secured by the purchased equipment 
the company s sales type leases consist of non cancelable leases of new equipment  generally with terms of months or greater 
it is the company s policy to securitize sales type leases 
the company believes that offering its customers flexible terms  including long term financing  is an advantageous competitive marketing program 
for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended june   no single customer accounted for or more of the company s consolidated revenues 
rental and installation  maintenance and other revenues the company also leases systems under non cancelable operating leases 
such leases are generally for terms of to months 
additionally  the company generates revenues from the installation  service and maintenance of its systems 
working capital items the company historically maintains a high level of accounts receivables and sales type leases outstanding  measured as a percentage of revenues 
this results  in part  from a key element of the company s marketing strategy to increase market penetration by providing alternative financing options to its retail customers including deferred billing and long term installment sales and lease terms  resulting in extended accounts receivable recovery periods 
additionally  the company has experienced a historical pattern of delayed payments by certain retail customers and  accordingly  the company s levels of receivables past due represent a relatively high percentage of total receivables 
this strategy has given the company a competitive marketing program and has helped the company penetrate markets and increase customer loyalty and commitment to sensormatic 
the ability to pursue such a strategy results from the company s relatively high gross profit margins and the financing programs the company has put in place which allow the company to sell its customer receivables and leases 
product research  development and engineering though research  development and engineering expenditures decreased slightly during fiscal when compared to fiscal  over the past decade  these expenditures have trended upwarded 
the increase in these activities has resulted in the continued broadening of the systems and technology offered by the company  resulting in the expansion of the applications and customer base for the company s systems 
new product development in all product categories continues to be a high priority for the company 
during fiscal  the company introduced new or enhanced eas products  while eliminating products from its portfolio 
additionally  during fiscal  the company introduced new or enhanced video and access control products 
the company has strengthened its research  development and engineering activities by increasing its investment in sophisticated engineering equipment  expanding key consulting relationships throughout the world and substantially increasing its professional engineering staff  with particular emphasis on magnetic materials research  digital signal processing  rf data transmission and software development skills 
several of the company s eas systems depend on the use of magnetic materials and the company has liaisons with many key research centers throughout the world 
software is another major element in the company s new product designs and manufacturing processes 
in fiscal  and  the company incurred approximately million  million and million  respectively  for research  development and engineering costs 
the reduced level in fiscal when compared to was due to the company s efforts to outsource certain products resulting in a reduction in the associated research  development and engineering expenses 
planned consolidations and product rationalizations resulted in reduced spending levels during fiscal during fiscal  the company expects spending for research  development and engineering to be approximately higher than fiscal governmental regulation the sale and use of the company s products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the sale and use of electronic and communication equipment or health and safety standards eg  the eg department of health and human services 
such products are in compliance with currently applicable requirements and standards under the regulations of government authorities in the us  in countries in which the company markets such products directly or through its subsidiaries and in many other countries 
in particular  electromagnetic field emf emissions from the company s eas systems are within the levels permitted by such current us safety standards applicable to such equipment 
although there can be no assurance that rules or regulations establishing more restrictive standards will not be adopted by government authorities in the us  the company believes that the emf levels generated by the eas systems it markets will remain within any such new safety standards which may be established 
in addition  in view of the company s high level of business activity in the european union eu  the company actively participates in the development of evolving technical standards issued by cenelec european committee for electrotechnical standardization and etsi european telecommunications standards institute 
as of january  new standards were required to be met to apply the ce mark to market products in the eu  and the company certified its products to the ce mark requirements 
meeting ce mark requirements includes meeting standards established by cenelec  etsi and other standards setting organizations 
in addition  the eu council of health ministers recently recommended basic guidelines for exposure to emf emissions 
these guidelines contemplate that standards relating to measurement methods  duration of exposure and other criteria must be developed by member states and or international bodies such as cenelec to implement such guidelines 
these guidelines  together with such standards as are developed  would be subject to adoption  as presented or with modifications  by individual countries 
the company is actively working with cenelec to help develop such standards relating to eas and related products 
the company expects that the products it markets will comply with such standards as may be developed implementing the basic guidelines  if and when such standards and guidelines have been adopted by individual countries 
such standard setting organizations are continually considering the establishment of new standards and reconsidering existing standards  including health and safety standards 
there can be no assurance that adverse changes or amendments to existing regulations or standards  or new adverse regulations or standards  will not be adopted  or that all products of the company subject to regulations or standards will meet the requirements of all such regulations and standards in all countries in which the company desires its products to be marketed 
the us food and drug administration fda has been examining the effects of various devices  including eas systems  on implantable medical devices 
the fda has issued a physician advisory letter recommending that patients with implantable medical devices avoid lingering near  or leaning on  eas systems 
fda staff members indicated  in connection with the release of such letter  that the fda does not view interactions with eas systems as representing a significant public health hazard and made reference to the large number of people passing through such systems each day in relation to the small number of reported incidents 
manufacturers of implantable medical services  as well as the company and the international electronic article surveillance manufacturers association of which the company is a member  have long offered the same advice as was given by the fda 
an american heart association science advisory also agreed with the fda recommendations  as did statements recently issued by the european society of cardiology and the uk medical devices agency 
the company is also aware of other studies as to whether any hazards are posed to wearers of implantable medical devices by eas systems 
while the company believes there to be substantial evidence that no health hazard is posed by the interactions between the company s eas systems and such medical devices  including opinions expressed by leading physicians  and has presented such evidence to the fda  and offers such evidence to persons conducting such studies  there can be no assurance that such studies will not result in the publication of adverse reports  the recommendation of precautionary measures and or the adoption of regulations which could adversely affect the company

in addition  expenses and working capital requirements increased to unacceptable levels 
consequently  in fiscal  the company launched a strategic restructuring plan with the following objectives i expense reduction and asset control  ii improved processes and systems  and iii quality  sustainable growth 
the initial phase of this plan included an extensive and systematic review of the company s operations  cost structure and balance sheet aimed at reducing its operating expenses and manufacturing costs while increasing efficiencies 
this review of the company s global operations focused primarily on operational systems  organizational structures  facilities utilization  product rationalization  quality improvements  inventory levels and accounts receivable balances and related collection efforts 
at the end of fiscal  the company announced further restructuring actions which included the divestiture of non core businesses and additional cost reduction plans  which mainly included staff reductions within its european operations 
restructuring charges as a result of its restructuring plan  the company instituted a major reorganization of its business units 
the principal objective of the reorganization was to improve market focus  customer service and product quality while reducing costs and eliminating redundancies 
related to the fiscal restructuring plan  the company planned for the reduction of people and the sale  disposal or termination of lease arrangements of locations  principally in the uk and uk at june   all planned terminations have been completed and the majority of the facilities have been eliminated or subleased 
the company also reviewed its existing product lines and product sourcing to discontinue marginally profitable products and outsource other products 
the fiscal pre tax restructuring charges and inventory write downs relating to the restructuring activities were million of which million consisted of inventory write downs recorded in costs of sales 
upon completion of the restructuring activities  anticipated savings in operating expenses and manufacturing costs are estimated to be million 
through june   the savings realized as a result of this plan have been partially offset by reinvestment in the company s business  including costs associated with the addition of approximately employees in strategic growth and key technical areas  the new enterprise wide management information system and related costs  and by increased legal fees relating principally to then pending litigation and government investigations including the matters referred to under legal proceedings of item these savings were also partially reflected as reductions in manufacturing costs which have helped to generally maintain gross profit margins in the face of intense price competition 
in fiscal  the company continued to review its organization to improve market focus and customer service as well as reduce costs 
accordingly  the company announced additional restructuring activities in fiscal which included the divestiture of non core businesses and workforce reductions  principally in its european operations 
the principal non core business divested by the company was its us commercial industrial direct sales and installation business which was sold in september the company elected to exit this commercial industrial direct sales and installation activity due to market conflicts with its indirect sales channels dealers and distributors 
this strategic decision allows the company to focus on partnering with dealers and distributors to promote products in the commercial industrial division 
in connection with this restructuring plan  the company planned for the reduction in workforce of approximately  positions  of which related to the divestiture of non core businesses and the remaining positions principally represented the termination of administrative personnel 
as of june   approximately of the positions had been eliminated  including the positions associated with the divested business units  and the rest will be terminated as soon as practicable 
the pre tax restructuring charges related to this restructuring plan were million  of which million including million of inventory write downs recorded in costs of sales was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  million  net was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal and the balance of million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal the million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal was net of a reversal of million  originally recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  for estimated losses due to the company s plan to sell its us commercial industrial direct sales and installation business 
as of june   total cash disbursed was million  offset by million of proceeds received from the sale of non core businesses 
upon completion of the planned restructuring activities  the company expects annualized savings of approximately million 
the most significant portion of the savings from restructuring approximately or approximately million was expected to result from involuntary employee terminations 
in the fiscal charge the company planned for involuntarily termination of employees 
approximately of these employees were in europe 
these terminations were completed as of march  in the fiscal charge  the company planned for the involuntary termination of employees excluding an additional employees that would leave the company s employment upon the disposition of non core businesses 
approximately of these employees were in europe 
worldwide  through june   excluding the positions associated with the divested business units  employees had been involuntarily terminated and the rest will be terminated as soon as practicable 
the realized savings in the us are consistent with those originally expected 
in europe  realized and expected savings from yet to be completed involuntary terminations of employees are expected to produce the savings initially contemplated 
in general  the involuntary termination of employees in europe is a lengthy process because of the individual administrative process which needs to be followed in each country 
in addition  as a result of successive changes in european management  implementation of the european restructuring plan has been delayed 
while the speed of execution is slower than originally anticipated  no changes have been made to the original restructuring plan and the company is proceeding with the remaining involuntary employee separations and location consolidations 
incremental accounts receivable  inventory and other charges in fiscal  as part of the company s plan to focus on asset management and review its balance sheet in view of the then existing business environment  the company performed an extensive review of the collectibility of accounts receivable  including off balance sheet receivables 
this initiative was primarily the result of the overall weakening in the retail industry following a poor holiday season 
in addition  several c i and retail customers had filed for bankruptcy and other customers experienced financial difficulties 
the company also conducted a review of slow moving and potentially obsolete inventory in light of softening demand for certain eas products 
in fiscal and  the company recorded further incremental charges relating to accounts receivables  inventories  certain employee separation and warranty and contract resolution costs 
the related amounts and their effects are discussed below 
net litigation settlement charge in november  the company reached an agreement to settle a series of class action lawsuits filed during fiscal the class action stockholder lawsuit challenged the company s prior revenue recognition practices in fiscal and earlier 
the terms of the agreement provided for an approximately million settlement payment 
the company recorded a net pre tax charge of million with an after tax effect of million in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company also recovered a portion of the settlement amount and related expenses from its primary directors and officers liability insurance policy  which has a policy limit of million  and was paid an amount equal to the policy limit of million by one of its two excess directors and officers liability insurers pursuant to a settlement 
as a result of this recovery  the company recorded a pre tax insurance recovery of million net with an after tax effect of million in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  the company reached agreement with its other excess insurance carrier providing for the payment by the carrier of million in settlement of its insurance obligations in connection with  among other things  settlement of the above class action  and recorded the related insurance recovery 
other strategies to assist with the company s restructuring plan objective to improve processes and systems  the company has embarked upon a process improvement and total quality management program internally referred to as q 
the program s objective is to provide superior value for customers  shareholders and employees 
q is a multi year effort in which the company will reengineer the way it operates enterprise wide 
the program is also establishing a culture of continuous improvement in all of the company s business processes to reduce cost and increase customer satisfaction 
in connection with this program  the company has committed to the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system and an extensive internal training program  both of which are expected to significantly enhance operational efficiencies and improve customer service

consolidated revenues for the eas worldwide product lines increased from fiscal eas revenue growth was driven by an increase in ultra max revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset by declines in other eas system revenues  principally the electromagnetic systems

excluding the effect on revenues of this divested non core business  north america based c i revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in revenues is due to new product introductions and customer service initiatives 
gross margins and operating income gross margins were for fiscal compared with for fiscal the decline in gross margin percentages was primarily due to a increase in service revenue  which currently has a lower gross margin than the company s product revenue  and to a lesser degree by pricing allowances on larger shipments to major retailers 
the decline in gross margin for fiscal was more than offset by lower operating expenses for the year 
excluding restructuring charges  operating income for fiscal was million or of total revenue  versus million or of total revenue in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administration expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were in fiscal versus in fiscal included in selling  general and administration expenses in fiscal was million relating to certain employee separation and warranty and contract resolution costs

 accounting for income taxes  a deferred tax asset is recognized for deductible future temporary differences 
a valuation allowance against this asset is recognized if  based upon the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has evaluated its deferred tax assets 
management believes  more likely than not  that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize substantially all of these assets  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in addition  the company has identified tax planning strategies it will utilize  if necessary  to realize a substantial portion of the recorded deferred tax assets 
a significant portion of these deferred tax assets relate to the future benefit of tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
the company has analyzed the use of the carryforwards on a country by country basis and recognized the related tax benefit where the carryforwards are expected to be utilized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  sfas no 
requires an assessment of all available evidence both positive and negative 
where a valuation allowance was not recorded  the company believes that there was sufficient positive evidence to support its conclusion not to record a valuation allowance 
management believes that the company will utilize the loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income because the company generated taxable income in fiscal and utilized approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards  prior to the restructuring charges and shareholder litigation settlement costs  the company had a history of pre tax income  a significant portion of the loss carryforwards resulted from restructuring and shareholder litigation settlement costs  management believes that the restructuring of the company s businesses will reduce their cost structures and that the company will be profitable and will generate taxable income in the near term  management is aware of viable tax strategies that could be implemented to accelerate taxable income in order to realize a substantial portion of the recorded deferred tax assets  and a significant portion of the net operating losses have an indefinite life or do not expire in the near term 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will generate taxable income or that all of its loss carryforwards will be utilized 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion  including amounts of net operating losses by country and expiration dates 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal except as otherwise indicated  the following discussion of operating results excludes the effects of the net restructuring charges and inventory write downs relating to restructuring activities and the net litigation settlement charges recorded in fiscal and  which were discussed above 
revenues revenues for fiscal decreased  or million  from fiscal fiscal results were negatively affected by the strengthening of the us dollar against currencies in europe and asia and the related impact of foreign currency fluctuations  resulting in a reduction in revenues of approximately million 
fiscal revenues also reflect the decline in revenues of certain non core businesses  principally the us commercial industrial direct sales and service business which was sold in september excluding the effects of the strengthening of the us dollar against currencies in europe and asia and the divestiture of non core businesses  fiscal revenues increased approximately 
consolidated revenues for the eas product lines remained relatively unchanged from fiscal however  ultra max revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal unit level volume for source tagging  which is based on the company s eas technologies  increased by approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal  resulting in sales of more than million labels 
the increase in ultra max revenues was partially offset by declines in other eas system revenues  principally the sensorstrip checkout systems 
revenues from sensorstrip checkout systems  principally sold in europe  decreased from fiscal where they were negatively affected by the strengthening of the us dollar against most european currencies and market saturation in certain countries 
overall cctv revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal a significant percentage of cctv revenues and nearly all of access control revenues are generated by c i worldwide which was negatively impacted in fiscal by the decline in revenues partially due to the divestiture of a non core business 
due to channel conflicts  the company made a strategic decision to exit the commercial industrial direct sales and service business in the us and partner with its dealers and distributors to promote its products in the commercial industrial markets and thereby lower its distribution and installation costs 
the company s us commercial industrial direct sales and service business  which had fiscal year revenues of approximately million  was sold to security technologies group  inc stg 
the company also agreed in such transaction to sell to stg the company s monitoring business  the sale of which was consummated in october installation and product revenues from the divested business unit were approximately million in fiscal north america retail revenue for fiscal increased versus fiscal eas market penetration increased in the following market segments music  discounters  mass merchants  automotive  office supply  home centers  video and shoes 
excluding the effect on revenues of a divested non core business  north america retail revenues increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal europe retail revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal excluding the effect of exchange due to foreign currency fluctuations  europe retail revenues increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal the company believes that europe retail s results during fiscal were negatively impacted by a shift from direct sales to indirect sales  a decrease in sales to low end users and increased competition 
international retail revenues  which includes latin america  asia pacific and the middle east  increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in international retail was largely due to latin america revenues which increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  asia pacific revenue growth was negatively impacted by the asian currency volatility 
excluding the effect of acquisitions and currency effects  international retail revenues for fiscal increased as compared to fiscal revenues generated by c i worldwide decreased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in revenues is principally due to the divestiture referred to above in september of the us commercial industrial direct sales and service business 
excluding the effect on revenues of this divested non core business and foreign exchange  c i worldwide indirect revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margins and operating income before restructuring charges and inventory write downs relating to restructuring activities  gross margins were for fiscal compared with for fiscal the decrease in gross margin percentages reflect pricing pressures in some market segments for retail article protection equipment  partially offset by savings from cost reduction efforts 
excluding restructuring charges and inventory write downs relating to restructuring activities  operating income for fiscal was million or of total revenue  versus million or of total revenue in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administration expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were in fiscal versus in fiscal included in selling  general and administration expenses in fiscal and were million and million  respectively  relating to certain employee separation and warranty and contract resolution costs 
as a percentage of revenue  these amounts were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal reflects the benefit from cost reduction efforts resulting from the restructuring actions previously discussed  as well as the divestiture of the us commercial industrial direct sales and service business which typically had a higher operating expense level in relation to revenues 
provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts  as a percentage of total revenues  was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the higher provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal reflects the company s assessment of accounts receivable collection experience in certain market segments  following the extensive review of accounts which took place in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses increased to of total revenues in fiscal versus in fiscal research  development and engineering spending increased as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year due to the company s increased focus on new product development in all product categories 
other expenses income non operating expenses  which include interest expense and interest income  increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is principally due to an increase in interest expense due to higher average debt levels in fiscal as compared to fiscal as well as the company s decision to substitute long term fixed rate borrowings for short term variable rate borrowings to insulate the company from interest rate volatility 
fiscal non operating expenses also included a gain of approximately million as a result of the cancellation of certain foreign currency contracts 
these forward contracts  which allowed the company to sell british pounds for a fixed us dollar amount  were canceled as a result of the recapitalization of its uk affiliate 
taxes the company s worldwide effective tax rate benefit for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased million primarily due to significant improvements in cash provided by operations 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million in fiscal compared with cash used of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the improvement in cash provided by operations in fiscal as compared to cash used in fiscal was primarily due to improvements in net income and decreases in inventories and customer receivables 
the company historically maintains a high level of receivables and sales type leases outstanding  measured as a percentage of revenues 
this results  in part  from a key element of the company s marketing strategy  which has been to provide alternative financing options to its retail customers  including deferred billing and long term installment sales and lease terms  resulting in extended accounts receivable recovery periods 
additionally  the company has experienced a historical pattern of delayed payments by certain retail customers and  accordingly  the company s levels of receivables past due represent a relatively high percentage of total receivables 
the company s strategy has helped it penetrate markets and increase customer loyalty and commitment to sensormatic 
the ability to pursue such a strategy results from the company s relatively high gross profit margins and the various accounts receivable securitization programs the company has put in place which allow the company to sell its customer receivables 
the terms of certain of the company s principal receivable securitization programs provide for overcollateralization and accordingly the company does not receive the full balance of such receivables until the customer s receivables have been paid in full to financing institutions 
the company accounts for this overcollateraliza tion as a receivable due from financing institution which is included in other current assets and the non current portion in patents and other assets net 
the company aggressively pursues the sale and or securitization of all its long term customer receivables and a significant portion of its trade customer receivables 
the company believes the gross profit margin it receives on the sale of its products  combined with the interest income it receives on such receivables  are sufficient to cover the carrying cost of the long term customer receivables which it is unable to securitize and the overcollateralization holdbacks 
the company s investing activities used million of cash in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal additions to property  plant and equipment  during fiscal  totaled million  primarily relating to investments in the company s global enterprise resource planning system and manufacturing operations for new production equipment 
additional investing activities also included increases in revenue equipment of million  which represents equipment held under operating leases  and additional investments in acquisitions of million relating to on going payments for commitments relating to prior year acquisitions 
during fiscal  the company plans to invest approximately million in capital projects 
the projects primarily include investments in label manufacturing operations for new production equipment and global enterprise resource planning systems 
fiscal financing activities used cash of million as compared with cash generated of million in fiscal fiscal cash used in financing activities is due primarily to repayments of bank borrowings 
cash generated in fiscal is principally due to proceeds received from the issuance of the new series of convertible preferred stock 
the proceeds from the convertible preferred stock were primarily used to repay the outstanding balance under the company s revolving credit line  the payable associated with the shareholder litigation settlement  and working capital and general corporate purposes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company s percentage of total debt to total capital was at june  as compared to at june  certain of the company s financial agreements currently prohibit the payment of cash dividends until after certain cumulative income levels are obtained  as reflected in the company s audited financial statements  and it is unlikely that the company would be able to pay cash dividends until after the preparation of its audited financial statements for fiscal year at the earliest 
the company intends to pay any dividends declared on the convertible preferred stock with shares of common stock prior to the time it is able to pay such cash dividends 
the company anticipates continuing to provide vendor financing to its customers and aggressively pursues collection of all accounts receivable past due 
the company is closely monitoring inventory and overall working capital requirements and has implemented numerous programs that are expected to result in reduced working capital requirements 
the company requires significant cash flow to meet its debt service and other continuing obligations 
as of june   the company has million of total indebtedness outstanding 
the company s principal liquidity requirements are expected to be to provide working capital  finance customer equipment purchases  invest in revenue equipment and capital expenditures and meet debt service requirements  including the payment of principal and interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and principal and interest on the senior notes 
at june   the company s principal sources of liquidity are i cash on hand  ii cash flow from operations  iii borrowings under the million revolving credit facility  which had unused availability of million  and iv receivable securitization facilities 
the company believes that cash on hand and cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
the million revolving credit facility will expire in december the company plans to replace this committed facility with a revolving credit facility in fiscal currency risks see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks and derivatives see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no

based upon a hypothetical point increase in the period end market interest rate  the fair value of this liability would decrease by approximately million resulting in a receivable of million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
exposure to exchange rates as a result of the sales of its products in foreign markets  the company s offshore operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollars as compared to foreign currencies 
its offshore operations are principally in europe  asia and latin america 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against the earnings effects of short term fluctuation in significant foreign jurisdictions 
the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
therefore  increases and decreases in the fair value of foreign currency forward agreements are offset by changes in the fair value of net underlying foreign currency transaction exposures 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro and the british pound against the us dollar 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from intercompany loans utilized to finance foreign subsidiaries  receivables  payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
the company attempts to have all such transaction exposures hedged with internal natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and  once these opportunities have been exhausted  through derivative financial instruments with third parties using forwards 
at june  the company had in place foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million 
the carrying value of these contracts was an asset of million at june  the fair value of these contracts as of june  was immaterial 
based upon a strengthening of the us dollar compared to these foreign currencies  the estimated fair value of the asset would increase by million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates also change the dollar value of the resulting sales and affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in levels of local currency prices or sales reported in us dollars

the above discussion of the company s procedures to monitor market risk and the estimated changes in fair value resulting from the company s sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimated results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by the company to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or gains losses
