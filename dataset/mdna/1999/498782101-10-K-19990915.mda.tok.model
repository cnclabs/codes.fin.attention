item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
overview the company recorded consolidated net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal  compared to a loss of million  or per diluted share in the prior year 
while this may seem like a substantial improvement in the bottom line performance  the loss in fiscal was primarily attributable to the impairment and restructuring charges associated with the implementation of the company s strategy 
key activities included selling those operations which did not fit with the company s core competencies  eliminating redundant operations  continuously improving existing operations and investing in new products for and ways of doing business with the company s targeted customer base 
some of the current year steps accomplished are highlighted below in september  the company sold the hirsh company hirsh  a wholly owned subsidiary which manufactured free standing shelving  wood storage products and workshop accessories 
the loss of  associated with this sale was recorded in fiscal while this subsidiary produced products which did serve the targeted customer base  it did not do so profitably 
the dutch auction self tender offer was completed early in the second quarter of fiscal  which resulted in the purchase of  shares of the company s outstanding stock 
in addition  another  shares of stock were repurchased through june  in total  slightly over percent of the company s outstanding stock was repurchased during fiscal lean manufacturing techniques were implemented in the existing operations 
this step allowed the company to operate in a more efficient manner and enjoy increased profitability on the products it sold during the year

while the company does not maintain its sales records by product category  management believes the table below unaudited approximates total net sales in millions for each of the product categories year ended june shelving systems drawer slides hardware furniture components total net sales in fiscal declined million  or to million 
the most significant decline was in shelving systems and was primarily due to the sales contribution of hirsh which was sold in september excluding hirsh sales  fiscal net sales were million 
the remaining year to year decline was due to two key factors 
first  the company performed a profitability review of its current product offerings and decided to discontinue certain product lines which were either unprofitable or provided only a minimal return 
specifically  the company opted to re deploy production assets which were utilized to produce certain utility slides to the production of the more profitable precision drawer slides 
while this decision improved the bottom line  it did result in lower net sales for the fiscal year 
second  while the company experienced double digit growth in precision drawer slides when compared to the prior year  it did not achieve its planned level of sales during the last six months of the fiscal year 
management believes that the lower level of sales can be attributed to the fact that the office furniture market  the primary customer for the precision drawer slides  had relatively flat sales during this period 
given that the office furniture industry is projecting only nominal growth through the remainder of the calendar year  this will continue to be an area monitored closely by management 
net sales in fiscal increased million to a record million  or  over fiscal sales of million 
the increase in sales was due primarily to an increase in unit volumes 
drawer slide sales led this increase with a million improvement 
the increase was due to growth in precision drawer slide sales as the company expanded its shipments into the metal office furniture market 
euro style drawer slide sales increases in fiscal were offset by a decline in sales of utility slides 
shelving system sales increased by million due to increases in sales of wall attached shelving 
hardware sales declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal feeny s continued increase in the sales of its kitchen and bath storage products were offset by a decrease in the hirsh iron horse product line 
the decrease in iron horse sales was caused by a reduction in promotions of the product line at major home centers 
furniture component sales declined million 
no sales were recorded in fiscal due to the elimination of the product line in fiscal with the sale of modar inc gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal initially the sale of hirsh and the discontinuance of other low margin product lines resulted in a more favorable product mix which translated to improved gross profits beginning in the second quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  the company started to realize some of the benefits from the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques  which not only resulted in reduced manufacturing costs  but also allowed the company to improve its service to its customers 
during fiscal  management will continue the efforts to improve gross profits by utilizing lean manufacturing principles to help eliminate unnecessary costs in all aspects of the business  coupled with various initiatives underway to reduce the cost of its purchased components 
the decrease in the fiscal gross profit compared to fiscal was attributable to the company s continued investment in manufacturing and sales to aggressively enter the metal office furniture market  transition costs that cannot be classified as restructuring related to the reorganization of the company s canadian operation near toronto  continued softness in the canadian dollar  and an obsolete inventory charge of  selling and administrative selling and administrative expenses  as a percent of net sales  were in fiscal  compared to in both fiscal and while management took steps to reduce discretionary spending in response to the lower level of sales  total spending  as a percent of net sales  increased in fiscal primarily due to severance payments and costs associated with the company s strategic planning effort 
these increases were only partially offset by reductions in costs which are variable with performance  such as incentive programs and commissions 
restructuring impairment as a result of the decision to re deploy certain utility slide production assets  the company recorded an impairment loss of 
million pre tax in the second quarter of fiscal to write the related tooling assets down to their estimated fair value 
in addition  excess inventory of 
million pre tax related to the discontinued product lines was charged directly to cost of sales 
in september  the company sold hirsh  a wholly owned subsidiary 
the sale of hirsh reflected the company s desire to enhance its corporate margins and profitability and remain focused on its core products 
the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of million  which was included in the june   financial results 
the loss included the write off of the unamortized balance of goodwill recorded in connection with the purchase of hirsh 
in connection with the sale  the company recognized an additional tax cost of million  resulting in a total loss related to the sale of hirsh of million 
a pre tax restructuring charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal for knape vogt canada 
in march  knape vogt announced its plans to reorganize its canadian operation  including the sale of the company s manufacturing facility and equipment in the toronto area 
the sale was completed in may of the company will continue to sell and distribute its products in canada and maintain a sales office in the toronto area 
during fiscal  the sale of modar was completed and resulted in an additional pre tax restructuring and impairment of assets charge of 
million which represented the difference between the original estimate and the actual loss from the sale 
other expenses income and income taxes interest expense was 
million in fiscal  compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal years and the decrease in interest expense reflected the lower average borrowing levels in both fiscal and fiscal resulting from proceeds received from the sales of hirsh and roll it  along with cash flow from operating activities 
other miscellaneous expense income in fiscal included interest received on michigan single business tax refunds and two patent infringement settlements  partially offset by losses incurred on the disposal of fixed assets 
the other expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to the write off of fixed assets associated with a discontinued product line 
net income income from continuing operations in fiscal was million  or per diluted share compared to a loss of million or per diluted share in fiscal and net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal the loss recorded in fiscal was primarily due to the losses incurred on the sale of hirsh and the restructuring of knape vogt canada 
the results of operations of roll it  net of income taxes  were presented as a discontinued operation in both fiscal and fiscal in fiscal  the after tax loss from discontinued operation was million compared to million in fiscal on march   the company signed an agreement to sell roll it which resulted in an additional loss of 
million  due to the difference between the original estimate and the actual loss from the sale of roll it 
net income was million  or per diluted share in fiscal  compared to a loss of million  or per diluted share in fiscal the improvement over the prior year was due to the million after tax charge recorded for the sale of hirsh  the million restructuring charge for knape vogt canada and the additional loss of 
million on the sale of roll it 
without these charges  net income would have been million  or per diluted share in fiscal this compares to net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities generated million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the cash flows from the change in accounts payable were substantially lower than in fiscal  due to two factors 
first  in the prior year  the company adopted a more aggressive payment policy with its vendors which resulted in a higher accounts payable balance and a significant one time increase in cash flows 
second  even though the company was still utilizing the more aggressive payment policy with its vendors in fiscal  payables decreased due to the sale of hirsh 
cash flows from investing activities of million in fiscal included the cash proceeds of million received from the sale of hirsh 
the balance also included million of capital expenditures  compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal and the expenditures in fiscal were primarily for improvements in the company s manufacturing process  including the installation of the new powder coat paint line 
management believes that capital expenditures will increase in fiscal  as investments are made to improve manufacturing technology and to bring new products and product enhancements to the company s customers 
following the financial strategy announced last year  the company completed a dutch auction early in the second quarter of fiscal this resulted in the repurchase of  shares of the company s stock at a price of per share 
in addition  the company repurchased an additional  shares at prices ranging from approximately to per share through june  in total  the cost of the repurchased shares was million in fiscal the company has authorization to repurchase an additional  shares 
during fiscal  the company renegotiated its revolving credit facility 
the new facility allows for borrowings up to million and expires on november  in addition  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to fix the interest rate on a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the swap agreement  which expires on june   fixes the interest on million of borrowings through august   and increases to million beginning september  the swap agreement fixes the rate at plus the company s credit spread on the revolving credit agreement 
the company s outstanding debt at june   was million  compared to million in fiscal the debt to total capital ratio increased to at june   from at june  the company continues to manage its debt levels in an effort to reach its targeted capital structure 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and funds available under the new credit facility will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures in fiscal year compliance the year issue is the result of computer systems that use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which may prevent such systems from accurately processing dates ending in the year and after
