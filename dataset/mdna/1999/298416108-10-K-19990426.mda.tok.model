in addition  the company may need to delay or significantly reduce other operating expenditures  which would have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and business prospects 
year risks the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year based on recent assessments  the company determined that it would not be required to upgrade  modify  and or replace portions of its software and certain hardware so that those systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that the year issue is resolved with out modifications or replacements of existing software and certain hardware 
the company s plan in resolving the year issue involved the following four phases inventory  assessment  remediation  and testing implementation 
both information technology it and non information technology technology non it systems were addressed 
the company has completed its assessment of it and non it systems that could have been significantly affected by the year the completed assessment indicated that all of the company s significant it systems would not be affected  particularly the order entry  general ledger  billing  and inventory systems 
none of the company s non it systems would be affected 
based on a review of its product lines  the company has determined that most of the products it has sold and will continue to sell do not require remediation to be year compliant 
based on the results of product review and testing completed  the company believes its programming software for its audio consoles and r multi track recorders to be compliant as defined by the british stan dards institute disc pc definition 
accordingly  the company does not be lieve that the year presents a material exposure as it relates to the company s products 
the company has queried all of its significant suppliers and subcontractors systems with the company suppliers 
to date  the company is not aware of any supplier with a year issue that would materially impact the company s re sults of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that its suppliers will be year ready 
the inability of suppliers to complete their year resolution process in a timely fashion could materially and adversely impact the company 
the effect of noncompliance by suppliers is not determinable 
to date  the company has incurred costs of less than  on the year project  and estimates that there will be no material future costs 
as noted above  the company has completed all necessary phases of the year program 
the company believes that it is more likely to experience year problems with the systems of key suppliers rather than with the company s internal systems or products 
the company s year program includes efforts to assess the year compliance of its key suppliers 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of the year program 
the company intends to develop a contingency plan to deal with year issues that may materially adversely affect its business processes 
the company intends to have a contingency plan in place no later than september  impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which is required to be adopted in years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to materially impact the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or ob tained for internal use sop  on march  sop provides guidelines for accounting for costs of computer software developed for internal use 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sop is not expected to materially impact the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
factors affecting future operating results the company has derived virtually all of its revenues from sales of its dig itally controlled audio mixing console system  which system is based upon its hardware platform 
the company believes that sales of this system  along with enhancements thereof  and the r recorder will continue to constitute virtually all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  any fac tor adversely affecting the company s base system  whether technical  competi tive or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s busi ness and results of operations 
the company has expended and will continue to expend substantial funds to launch its new system and r recorder products in the first half of fiscal the company s ability to fund operations through december  is dependent upon achievement of its operating plan and attainment of additional equity financing 
the company believes that additional debt or equity financing will be available from existing investors and others 
however  there can be no assurance as to the terms and conditions of any such financing and no certainty that funds would be available when needed 
the inability to obtain additional financing  when needed  would be likely to curtail the company s sales and mar keting and product development efforts and would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
to the extent that any future financing involves the sale of the company s equity securities  the company s then existing share holders could be substantially diluted 
a limited number of the company s system sales typically account for a sub stantial percentage of the company s quarterly revenue because of the relatively high average sales price of such systems 
moreover  the company s expense levels are based in part on its expectations of future revenue 
therefore  if revenue is below expectations  the company s operating results are likely to be adverse ly affected 
in addition  the timing of revenue is influenced by a number of other factors  including the timing of individual orders and shipments  industry trade shows  seasonal customer buying patterns  changes in product development and sales and marketing expenditures  custom financing arrangements  production limitations and international sales activity 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  variations in the timing of recognition of revenue could cause significant fluctuations in operat ing results from quarter to quarter and may result in unanticipated quarterly earnings shortfalls or losses 
the markets for the company s system are characterized by changing technolo gies and new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its continued ability to enhance its base system with features includ ing new software and hardware add ons and to develop or acquire and introduce new products and features which meet new market demands and changing customer requirements on a timely basis 
the company is currently designing and develop ing new products  primarily in the areas of recording  editing and mixing func tions of sound production as well as digital audio processing and networking systems 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or technologies non competitive or obsolete

to date  the company s primary market success has been in the music segment of the professional audio market 
in order for the company to grow  the company believes that it must continue to gain market share in the music market segment  as well as in its other targeted market segments 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete favorably in any market segments 
the com pany s inability to compete favorably could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive and characterized by significant price competition 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends on elements both within and outside its control  including the success and timing of new product de velopment including development on a timely basis of a hybrid digital product  of which there can be no assurance and introduction by the company and its com petitors  product performance and price  distribution  availability of lease or other financing alternatives  resale of used systems and customer support 
see business competition 
currently  the company uses many sole or limited source suppliers  certain of which are critical to the integrated circuits included in the company s base system 
major delays or terminations in supplies of such components could have a significant adverse effect on the company s timely shipment of its products  which in turn would adversely affect the company s business and results of oper ations 
the company also relies on single vendors to manufacture major subassem blies for its products 
any extended interruption in the future supply or in crease in the cost of subassemblies manufactured by its primary or other third party vendors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business manufacturing and suppliers 
in addition  as different electrical  radiation or other standards applic able to the company s products are adopted in countries  including the united states  or groups of countries in which the company sells its products  the failure of the company to modify its products  if necessary  to comply with such standards would likely have an adverse effect on the company s business and re sults of operations 
see business sales and distribution 
the company generally relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright law and trademark law  contracts and technical measures to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products and technologies 
however  the company be lieves that such measures provide only limited protection of its proprietary in formation  and there is no assurance that such measures will be adequate to pre vent misappropriation 
in addition  significant and protracted litigation may be necessary to protect the company s intellectual property rights  to determine the scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of in fringement 
there can be no assurance that third party claims alleging infringe ment will not be asserted against the company in the future 
any such claims could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
see business proprietary rights 
the company s success depends  in part  on its ability to retain key manage ment and technical employees and its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
in addition  the company s ability to manage any growth will require it to continue to improve and expand its management  oper ational and financial systems and controls 
if the company s management is un able to manage growth effectively  its business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
the company acquired spectral in february sale of spectral products for  and were significantly below plan and below sales levels 
spectral s pre tax operating loss for decreased from and due primarily to transferring the general and administrative  and sales func tions to palo alto 
in  spectral engineering  marketing and sales activi ties were integrated into the respective euphonix organizations 
in  the company further integrated spectral activities by the transfer of their manufac turing to euphonix headquarters in palo alto  california 
in  the company sold spectral s technology to telos  inc as a result of these and other factors  the company has experienced signifi cant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipates that these fluctuations will continue in future periods 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in maintaining or improving its profitability or avoiding losses in any future period 
further  it is likely that in some future period the company s net revenues or operating results will be below the expec tations of public market securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affect ed

however  based on the investment portfolio contents  the company believes that if a significant change in interest rates were to oc cur  it would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows  although there can be no assurance of this 
sales through the company s japanese subsidiary are denominated in japanese yen 
the company s receivables denominated in yen are subject to foreign ex change risk 
the company does not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate the foreign currency risk with respect to such arrangements
