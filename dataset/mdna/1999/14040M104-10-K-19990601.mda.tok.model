actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors  including the company s successful execution of internal performance strategies  changes in general national and regional economic conditions  such as levels of employment  consumer confidence and income  availability to homebuilders of financing for acquisitions  development and construction  availability to homebuyers of permanent mortgages  interest rate levels and the demand for housing  supply levels of land  labor and materials  difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals from governmental authorities  difficulties in marketing homes  regulatory changes and weather including el nino and other environmental uncertainties  competitive influences  and the outcome of pending and future legal claims and proceedings 
results of operations general the following table illustrates the actual and pro forma results of the company s operations for the past three fiscal years 
the pro forma results have been adjusted to reflect the inclusion of the operating results of the company s unconsolidated joint ventures  including the portion attributable to the company s joint venture partners  and are used throughout this discussion for comparative purposes wherever the phrase pro forma is utilized 
results of operations amounts in thousands year ended february  february  february  pro forma pro forma pro forma including including including actual joint ventures actual joint ventures actual joint ventures sales of homes and land       cost of sales       gross margin       as is noted in footnote to the financial statements presented herein  the company is reporting its results on a consolidated basis with the results of cph llc 
references to the company in this item are  unless the context indicates otherwise  also references to cph llc 
at the current time  all material financing transactions and arrangements are incurred either by cph llc or by project specific entities 
fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  the company reported income from operations of million in fiscal  as compared to a net loss from operations of million in fiscal the company reported net income of million  or per share  in fiscal  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal the results for fiscal included an million non cash charge primarily for the impairment of certain real estate projects 
sales of homes and land including unconsolidated joint ventures were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase was due to an increase in total home closings from in fiscal to in fiscal  including and homes  respectively  closed in unconsolidated joint ventures  as well as an increase in average sales price from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in closings and average sales price was due primarily to stronger demand in all of the company s markets  and  to a lesser extent  due to a recovery from the negative effect of el nino weather conditions on fiscal closings 
the company s actual gross margin improved from in fiscal to in fiscal  and the pro forma gross margin improved from in fiscal to in fiscal  due to a larger volume of closings in the higher margin joint ventures during fiscal selling  general and administrative expense of million for fiscal decreased million or as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to higher unit closings and higher margins in the ongoing joint ventures  principally grand coto estates  lp and mpe partners  mpe mpe 
interest and other income remained steady at million between years and consists primarily of the results of operations of the company s mortgage broker operations 
minority interest of  in fiscal and million in fiscal primarily represents the share of cph llc s income attributable to chf since october  interest incurred was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  while interest expensed was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal substantially all interest costs are initially capitalized and are recognized as homes and land are sold 
as presented in the consolidated statements of operations  income from unconsolidated joint ventures for fiscal excludes the recognition of approximately million in interest previously capitalized to the lots contributed to mpe 
such interest costs are included in interest expense 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal  as compared to a benefit of  in fiscal the effective tax rate in both years was reduced from the statutory rate by the availability and use of net operating loss carryforwards 
fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  the company reported a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal  due primarily to the million non cash charge discussed above as compared to net income of million  or per share  in fiscal sales of homes and land including unconsolidated joint ventures were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease is due to a decrease in total home closings from  in fiscal to in fiscal  including and homes  respectively  closed in unconsolidated joint ventures 
as an offset to the decreased closing activity  the company s average sales price per unit has increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a increase 
the decrease in closings and the resultant decrease in sales were primarily due to the effect  prior to the restructuring discussed above  of constraints in both the bank lines and bond indenture which limited construction starts and sale releases in the past several quarters 
in addition  the level of closings was negatively impacted by the unusually wet winter in california precipitated by the el nino weather phenomenon 
due primarily to the non cash charge of million  the company s actual gross margin on home and lot closings decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the company s pro forma gross margin on home and lot closings decreased by a smaller percentage to during fiscal as compared to in fiscal due to the impact of a higher volume of closings in the higher margin joint ventures in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense of million for fiscal decreased million or as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense decreased from in fiscal to for this relationship is impacted positively by the company s ongoing cost containment efforts and adversely by the effect of lower revenues during fiscal income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due to both the higher unit closings and higher margins experienced in the company s current joint ventures 
interest and other income increased from  to  primarily as a result of increased activity in the company s mortgage broker operations 
minority interest of  for fiscal primarily represents the share of cph llc s income attributable to chf since october  interest incurred was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  while interest expensed was million during fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the company has recorded a net income tax benefit of  for fiscal reflecting the generation of a deferred income tax benefit during the year offset by current income taxes payable 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal cash requirements are for the acquisition  development  construction  marketing and overhead of its projects 
the need to stage the acquisition and use of raw materials such as land and finished lots and the need  on certain projects  to construct community facilities ahead of the start of home construction requires homebuilders such as the company to commit working capital for longer periods than many traditional manufacturing companies 
when building inventory  the company uses substantial amounts of cash that are generally obtained from borrowings  available cash flow from operations and partners contributions to joint ventures 
at the current time  all material financing transactions and arrangements are incurred either by cph llc or by certain project specific entities 
as of february   the company has in place several credit facilities with contingent availabilities totaling million the facilities with various bank lenders the banks  of which million was outstanding 
the facilities are secured by liens on various completed or under construction homes and lots held by cph llc and cph newport coast  llc  a consolidated joint venture 
pursuant to the facilities  cph llc is subject to certain covenants  which require  among other things  the maintenance of a consolidated liabilities to net worth ratio  minimum liquidity  minimum net worth and loss limitations  all as defined in the documents that evidence the facilities 
at february   cph llc was in compliance with these covenants 
the facilities also define certain events that constitute events of default 
as of february   no such event had occurred 
commitment fees are payable annually on some of the facilities 
homebuilding activity is being financed out of cph llc cash  bank financing  and the existing joint ventures  including joint ventures with institutional investors  including chf  the investor in cph llc 
in addition  development work undertaken in certain of the company s joint ventures is financed through various non recourse lending arrangements 
the company anticipates that it will continue to utilize both third party financing and joint ventures to cover financing needs in excess of internally generated cash flow 
in may  the company completed the sale of million of senior notes including  warrants to purchase common stock 
the proceeds from the offering were used to repay certain debt of the company  acquire certain properties and for general working capital and construction purposes 
the obligations associated with the senior notes have been transferred from the company to cph llc 
the indenture to which the senior notes are subject contains restrictions on cph llc on the incurring of indebtedness  which affect the availability of the facilities based on various measures of the financial performance of cph llc 
subject to such restrictions  the facilities are available to augment cash flow from operations and joint venture financing to fund the cph llc s operations 
management expects that cash flow generated from operations and from additional financing permitted by the terms of the indenture will be sufficient to cover the debt service and to fund cph llc s current development and homebuilding activities for the reasonably foreseeable future  and expects that capital commitments from its joint venture partners and other bank facilities will provide sufficient financing for the operation of its joint ventures 
interest rates and inflation the long term impact of inflation on the company is manifested in increased land prices  land development  construction and overhead costs balanced by increased sales prices 
the company generally contracts for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin and  accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes  land and other real estate properties may affect the company s profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time of sale and the company generally sells its homes prior to commencement of construction  any inflation of construction costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
the company generally attempts to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
housing demand  in general  is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as materials and other costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect the company s interest costs 
if the company is unable to duplicate its past ability to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance a home purchase  the company s homebuilding revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford a new home 
asset impairment charges during fiscal  in connection with the restructuring and recapitalization of the company discussed above  management completed a process of reevaluating and revising the company s business plan  including its plans for the development of its various projects 
as a result of this analysis  it was determined that certain of the company s projects would require an impairment charge when evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  management determined that certain warranty related reserves should be adjusted 
therefore  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a non cash charge of million 
operating results during fiscal year were adversely affected by asset impairment charges totaling million related to the write off of operational start up costs for the company s operations in arizona  the write off of certain redesign and materials costs previously capitalized to certain low margin projects in nevada and the write off of certain other costs 
year compliance the company began assessing its year yk compliance issues during fiscal and at that time determined that its primary internal computer hardware and computer software were not yk compliant 
subsequently  the company determined that it would be more cost efficient to install a new yk compliant software package than to modify the existing software package 
in late  the company contracted to purchase a new software package and upgraded its existing primary computer hardware system to support the new computer software package  as well as more fully integrate the company s operations 
the company s goal is full implementation of the new software package by august  as part of a program of continuous technology updates  for the past several years  the company has upgraded personal computers in its locations and this process will continue 
as this occurs during  personal computers at each company location will be tested for yk compliance 
these personal computer upgrades are considered to be ongoing and are not considered to be specifically yk related 
the company expects to incur some costs to replace or repair such equipment  but has not presently determined the amount of these costs  which are not expected to be material 
the company also is investigating the yk compliance status of its vendors  subcontractors and suppliers through the company s own vendor compliance program 
for example  the company has determined that its voicemail and security systems at its newport beach headquarters are not yk compliant  and upgrades to both systems were required 
the company s goal is to complete this investigation and any corrective efforts by june  since the company does not rely on any individual vendor  subcontractor or supplier for a significant portion of its operations  the potential impact of yk noncompliance risks arising from such entities is not expected to have any material effect on the company 
the company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that yk non compliance will result in disruptions to its business that will have a material adverse effect on the company 
to date  the company has incurred approximately  in connection with yk readiness  including hardware  software  consulting fees  and other expenses 
the company expects to incur additional expenditures of less than  in fiscal in the course of becoming yk compliant 
these consist primarily of costs of hardware and software which would otherwise be incurred by the company in the normal course of its business 
the additional costs incurred by the company may vary from these estimates but are not expected to be material 
the company s estimates of costs and completion dates for its yk readiness program represent management s best estimates 
these estimates are based upon many assumptions  including the availability of external resources to assist with systems remediation and replacement efforts  and key third party suppliers  vendors and customers being yk compliant 
if any of the assumptions ultimately prove to have been incorrect  the cost estimates and completion dates set forth above could be substantially and adversely affected 
while the company believes it is taking all appropriate steps to achieve internal yk compliance  any potential future business interruptions  costs  damages or losses related thereto  also are dependent upon the yk compliance of third parties 
in the event that the company or any of the company s vendors  subcontractors or suppliers experience disruptions due to the yk issue  the company s operations could be adversely affected 
the yk issue is universal and complex  as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way 
consequently  no assurance can be given that complete yk compliance can be achieved without significant additional costs 
also  the company could be materially impacted by widespread economic or financial market disruptions or by yk computer system failures at financial institutions or government agencies on which the company is dependent for financing  utilities  zoning  building permits and related matters 
there can be no assurance that yk will not adversely affect the company and its operations 
a formal yk internal contingency plan has not been prepared because the company does not anticipate a material disruption to its business and because the company is able to rely on a variety of systems  vendors  subcontractors and suppliers in the event of yk disruptions that are likely to occur 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  companies are required to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statements of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company is required to adopt sfas effective march  currently  the company does not have any instruments that would qualify as derivatives under sfas accordingly  the company does not believe sfas would have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or liquidity at the current time 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on its debt 
currently  the company does not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the purpose of the following analysis is to provide a framework to understand the company s sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of february  many of the statements contained in this section are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures under the heading forward looking statements 
the company utilizes debt financing primarily for the purpose of acquiring and developing land and constructing and selling homes 
historically  the company has made short term borrowings under its revolving credit facilities to fund these expenditures 
in addition  the company has previously issued million in fixed rate debt to provide longer term financing 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not the company s earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value of the debt instrument  but do affect the company s future earnings and cash flows 
the company does not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company would be required to refinance such debt 
holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in variable rate interest incurred for the coming year of approximately  the table below details the principal amount and the average interest rates for debt for each category based upon the expected maturity dates 
the carrying value of the company s variable rate debt approximates fair value due to the frequency of repricing of this debt 
the company s fixed rate debt consists of the senior notes payable 
senior notes payable are publicly traded debt instruments and their fair values are based on their quoted market prices as of february  expected maturity date february  fair thereafter total value dollars in thousands liabilities fixed rate debt    average interest rate variable rate debt      average interest rate the company does not believe that the future market rate risks related to the above securities will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity
