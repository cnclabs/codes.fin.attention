the company takes advantage of closeout and other special situation purchasing opportunities which frequently result in large volume purchases  and as a consequence  its cash requirements are not constant or predictable during the year and can be affected by the timing and size of its purchases 
the company s high level of committed credit allows it to take immediate advantage of special situation purchasing opportunities 
having such credit availability provides the company with a competitive advantage measured against many of its competitors 
the company s growth has been financed through cash flow from operations  borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the extension of trade credit 
in march  the company entered into a new million credit facility 
this facility is comprised of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
the facility expires on november  the term loan requires consecutive quarterly payments of  plus accrued interest commencing may  borrowings under the facility bear interest  at the company s option  at either the banks prime rate less basis points or libor plus a spread 
availability on the facility is the lesser of the total credit commitment or a borrowing base calculation based upon the company s accounts receivable and inventories 
the facility contains restrictive covenants which require minimum net worth levels  maintenance of certain financial ratios and limitations on capital expenditures and investments 
at january   the company had availability of million 
for fiscal year  cash provided by consolidated operating activities was million  compared to cash used in fiscal of million 
a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by increases in inventory and other assets  comprised the majority of the cash provided for fiscal increases in trade receivables  inventories  and a decrease in trade payables comprised the majority of cash used for fiscal cash used in investing activities decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal fiscal investing activities primarily comprised capital expenditures of million and the investment in lease acquisitions of million

total assets increased to million at fiscal year end  from million at year end working capital decreased to million in fiscal  from million at the prior year end  primarily as a result of increases in accounts payable and current portion of long term debt  and a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in inventory 
the current ratio was to at year end  from to at year end net fixed assets were million at the end of fiscal  an increase of million over fiscal year end  primarily related to capital expenditures for fixtures  equipment  and leasehold improvements related to new store openings  improvements to the new retail warehouse and distribution facility  and investment in management information systems initiatives 
the company currently anticipates opening new stores in each of the next few years 
in addition to new store openings  the company may increase the number of stores it operates through acquisitions 
management believes that from time to time  acquisition opportunities will arise 
possible acquisitions will vary in size and the company will consider larger acquisitions that could be material to the company 
in order to finance any such possible acquisitions  the company may use cash flow from operations  may borrow additional amounts under its revolving credit facility  may seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing or may use its equity securities as consideration 
the availability and attractiveness of any outside sources of financing will depend on a number of factors  some of which will relate to the financial condition and performance of the company  and some of which will be beyond the company s control  such as prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions 
seasonality the company  with the growth of its retail operations and the retail orientation of the vcm  ltd 
joint venture  has shifted its business mix more toward retail 
this shift will also effect the net sales and earnings pattern of the company  with a greater weighting toward the second half of the fiscal year 
year disclosure the company has completed a review of its internal management information systems regarding year issues 
the company s planned systems initiatives will resolve the majority of the issues as current systems are converted to year compliant systems 
for other legacy systems  the company has developed an action plan and begun implementing remedial measures 
all internal management information systems are expected to be in year compliance by mid fiscal the company estimates that costs associated with making internal management information systems year compliant will not be material  and thus will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the company also relies  directly and indirectly  on external systems of business enterprises such as suppliers  creditors  and financial organizations  both domestic and international 
many of these external business partners have not  as of yet  advised the company as to the status of their year program 
the company s operations could also be effected if its external business partners do not successfully implement year compliant systems
