forward looking statements the information provided in this report may contain forward looking statements or statements which arguably imply or suggest certain things about our future 
statements which express that valley forge scientific corp 
valley forge believes  anticipates  expects  or plans to as well as other statements which are not historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to statements about any competitive advantage we may have as a result of our installed base of electrosurgical generators in the field of neurosurgery  our belief that our products exceed industry standards or favorably compete with other companies new technological advancements  and the anticipated success of certain recently introduced products or products scheduled to be released in the near future for use in neurosurgery  other surgical disciplines  and the dental market 
these statements are based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable  but a number of factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements 
the company does not intend to update these forward looking statements 
investors are advised to review the additional cautionary statements section below for more information about risks that could affect the financial results of valley forge 
additional cautionary statements competition and risk of obsolescence from technological advances the markets in which valley forge s products compete are characterized by continuing technical innovation and increasing competition 
some surgical procedures which utilize or could utilize our products could potentially be replaced or reduced in importance by alternative medical procedures or new drugs which may adversely affect our business 
product acceptance and new products valley forge s growth depends in part on the acceptance of our products in the marketplace  the market penetration achieved by the companies which we have contracted with  and rely on  to distribute our products  foregoing alliances with companies to distribute our products and our ability to introduce new and innovative products that meet the needs of medical professionals 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to introduce new and innovative products or that the products valley forge introduces  or has introduced  will be widely accepted by the marketplace  or that companies that do or could distribute the company s products will achieve market penetration in the surgical disciplines and markets outside of neurosurgery 
our failure to penetrate markets outside of neurosurgery and continue to introduce new products or gain wide spread acceptance of our products would adversely affect our operations 
government regulation the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
although we have not experienced any substantial regulatory delays to date  there is no assurance that delays will not occur in the future  which could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
regulatory agencies periodically inspect valley forge s manufacturing facilities to ascertain compliance with good manufacturing practices and can subject approved products to additional testing and surveillance programs 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions and criminal penalties 
while we believe that we are currently in compliance  if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements  it could have an adverse effect on the our results of operations and financial condition 
uncertainties within the health care markets political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the united states to rapid  continuing and fundamental change 
although congress has not passed comprehensive health care reform legislation to date  it is believed that congress  state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems 
responding to increased costs and to pressure from the government and from insurance companies to reduce patient charges  health care providers have demanded  and in many cases received  reduced prices on medical devices and instrumentation 
these customers are expected to continue to demand lower prices in the future 
valley forge cannot predict what impact the adoption of any federal or state health care reform measures  private sector reform or market forces may have on our business 
however  pricing pressure is expected to continue to adversely affect profit margins 
product liability risk valley forge s products involve a risk of product liability 
although we maintain product liability insurance at coverage levels which we believe are adequate  there is no assurance that  if we were to incur substantial liability for product liability claims  insurance would provide adequate coverage against such liability
