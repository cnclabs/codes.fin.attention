year compliance the company s sporting goods division  escalade sports  has completed the evaluation  conversion and testing of its critical business systems to determine whether such systems will be able to properly process data for the year escalade sports employees first reviewed the underlying software codes for year compatibility  and then converted the codes where necessary to allow years to be read using four digits rather than two digits 
escalade sports employees then tested the converted code to determine whether the affected business system would operate without interruption when data using the year was input 
based on these processes  the company believes that escalade sports internal software systems are currently year compliant and have so notified the customers of escalade sports where appropriate 
escalade sports has also substantially completed the evaluation  conversion and testing of its business and manufacturing equipment to prepare for the year the company believes that such process will be completed in its entirety by the end of the first quarter of escalade sports has also requested year compliance assurances from its customers  vendors and other third parties such as utility companies

the most likely year problems that the company may face appear to arise from the possible noncompliance of third parties 
possible difficulties could arise in interfacing with major customers and or in receiving raw materials from suppliers 
the company is continuing to work with its customers to ensure that no material data transmission problems will arise 
the company also has  and is continuing to develop  back up sources for material vendors 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate that any such third party problems should have a material adverse effect on the company 
however  in the event that the year would cause the widespread loss of power  telecommunications and other utilities in the areas where the company operates  the disruption to the company s business may be material depending upon the length of time it would take such suppliers to restore service to normal levels

as the company continues to complete its evaluation  conversion and testing  the company will assess whether there are any specific areas where a contingency plan could help alleviate possible adverse effects from the year if so  the company will develop contingency plans in those areas prior to the end of item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk none
