item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we operate the following lines of business telecommunications services consisting of a core services  which include local and long distance voice and data telecommunications services provided to business customers and b other telecommunications services which consist principally of long distance operations which we acquired in january from midcom communications  inc midcom  and information services  which include the provision of information products and services to our telecommunications customers as well as the creation and distribution of information and entertainment products and services through a variety of media outlets such as radio  television and the internet 
the following discussion does not include the results of operations of global products or gateway  both of which have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
revenues several factors drive our revenues  including core telecommunications services revenues from local and long distance services are driven primarily by the number of customer lines installed and in service 
customers generally are billed a flat monthly fee and or a per minute usage charge 
data services revenues generally are billed as a flat monthly charge for capacity ordered 
professional services such as network design  network integration and maintenance are billed on a project basis 
revenue growth depends upon our addition of new customers in existing markets  our sale of bundled services  our expansion into new markets and our introduction of new services  such as broadband data transmission  or video conferencing 
revenues from core telecommunications services were approximately million in the quarter ended december  versus million in the quarter ended september   million in the quarter ended june   million in the quarter ended march  and million in the quarter ended december  we expect our core services to generate increasing revenues as we expand our network and as network utilization increases 
other telecommunications services other telecommunications services consist principally of long distance services provided to customers acquired from midcom in january who are not located in markets where we currently market or expect to market our telecommunications services in the near term 
we expect these revenues to decline over time through normal churn of this customer base 
information services information services revenues are generated principally by sales to cable networks and radio stations  sales to new media distribution channels  such as on line services  advertising sales and the bundling of content as an enhanced telecommunication service 
revenues are driven by the amount and quality of our available program rights during each quarter and some seasonality of sales  which affect quarter to quarter comparability 
we expect information services revenues to increase as we expand our information service offerings and sell these services to core customers 
costs factors relating to costs are as follows core telecommunications services costs associated with our core telecommunications services business include significant up front capital expenditures for development of the infrastructure required to provide facilities based local exchange  long distance and data services  including expenditures relating to the purchase and installation of switching equipment  radios  customer premise equipment and related site acquisition and installation costs along with intercity and intracity backbone facilities 
in addition  we are incurring start up costs related to our telecommunications services business that will not be capitalized  including some costs of engineering  sales office and service personnel  marketing  administrative and other personnel  certain of whom will be needed in advance of related revenues 
as we commence operations in a city  our cost of revenue percentage is greater as fixed costs are spread over less traffic 
margins on core services revenues are improved as traffic increases and our fixed network costs are spread over a larger traffic base and we increase the total percentage of traffic carried on our networks because this on net traffic results in higher operating margins than traffic carried on the facilities of other companies 
other telecommunications services costs associated with other telecommunications services are currently incurred through the resale of other carriers long distance facilities 
to the extent that this traffic is migrated to our own long distance network when available  gross margins will increase 
information services our information services businesses have production  distribution and administrative costs 
film production costs include those related to producing original products and licensing third party products and are capitalized as incurred and expensed as productions are completed and distributed 
overhead costs in the production division are also capitalized  allocated to films in progress and subsequently expensed as such films are completed and distributed 
other media production costs are expensed as incurred 
the distribution and advertising divisions incur royalty costs payable to third party producers and selling costs  both of which vary directly with sales of acquired product  as well as administrative costs and personnel related costs  which are primarily fixed in nature and are expensed as incurred 
results of operations revenues from our operating business lines are as follows in millions year ended december  telecommunications services core other information services total operating revenues year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenues generated by our telecommunications operations 
revenues from core services  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the revenue growth was primarily attributable to our existing customer base  continued national sales and installation of local  long distance and internet services to small and medium size business customers  the geographic and other expansion of sales  network and business operations  along with the rapidly expanding broadband and large accounts business units and certain acquisitions such as goodnet  pac net and lansystems 
based on revenues generated in december  core service revenues reached an annual run rate in excess of million compared with approximately million based on revenues generated in december through december   cumulative lines installed were more than  as compared with approximately  lines at december  revenues from other telecommunications services  which consists primarily of midcom long distance voice services other than sales attributable to national accounts increased by million  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from sales attributable to former midcom long distance operations which were acquired in january we expect a gradual attrition of this long distance revenue over subsequent periods 
revenues from information services increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million  for the year ended december   due primarily to strong internet and other advertising revenues 
cost of services and products increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of services and products for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in the cost of revenue percentage is the result of increased sales volumes  larger percentages of traffic being provisioned over our network  substantial supplier cost adjustments and or credits for volume or performance and control over internal costs 
while our gross profit margin should continue to gradually improve as increased volumes and larger percentages of traffic are provisioned over our own network facilities  the rate of improvement will be slower during periods when we expand into new markets  but will accelerate as these markets mature 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by million  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we continued to hire sales  marketing and related support personnel in connection with the expansion of our target markets 
we had approximately  employees at december  and approximately  at december  with our continued expansion  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars  but to be a declining percentage of revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million  for the year ended december   principally resulting from our acquisition and deployment of telecommunications equipment in connection with our telecommunications network buildout and amortization relating to goodwill  purchased customer lists and spectrum licenses 
for the reasons noted above  the operating loss for the year ended december  was million  compared with an operating loss of million for the year ended december  interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to the issuance of million of debt in and another million of debt in the first quarter of of the million of interest expense incurred for the year ended december   million was payable in cash 
interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from the additional interest income earned on the proceeds from our various stock and debt placements 
for the year ended december   we incurred dividends of million on our placements of series a  series c and series d preferred stock of which million were paid in kind 
for the reasons noted above  we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increased revenues generated by our core services  other telecommunications services and information services businesses 
revenues from core telecommunications services  which include all commercial end user customer telecommunication revenues  were million for the year ended december   and were minimal for the year ended december   as the telecommunications business commenced operations in the second quarter of based on revenues generated in december  annualized revenues for the core business were approximately million 
as of december   the core business had installed approximately  lines  up from approximately  lines at september  and  lines at december  revenues from other telecommunications services increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from the growing number of billed circuits  along with installation revenues and equipment sales related to contract services provided 
revenues from information services increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to continued internal growth and acquisitions  including the telebase online business service acquired earlier in cost of services and products increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  cost of services and products for the year ended december  was compared to in the year ended december   as a result of increasing network costs from the continued expansion of our local telecommunications business 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we continued to hire sales  marketing and related support personnel in connection with the accelerated rollout of our core operations  which had only employees at december  and approximately  employees at december  in addition  we increased spending on related advertising and marketing of our core services 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   principally resulting from our acquisition and deployment of switches  radios and other equipment in connection with our telecommunications network buildout 
for the reasons noted above  the operating loss for the year ended december  was million  compared with an operating loss of million for the year ended december  interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to our issuance of debt in of the million interest expense for the year  million is payable in cash 
interest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for year ended december  the increase resulted from the additional interest income earned on the proceeds from our issuance of debt and equity securities in in  we incurred dividends of million on our placements of series a preferred stock and series c preferred stock  of which million were paid in kind 
for the reasons noted above  we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources in february  we sold  shares of our common stock  at per share and received net proceeds of million 
in december  we sold williams a wireless fiber iru  for which they will pay us million ratably as we construct up to hub sites during the next three years 
as of december   we have delivered  and williams has accepted  hub sites  for which williams paid us million in february in addition  williams will pay us at least million over a ten year period for network maintenance services that we will provide over the term of the wireless fiber iru 
in october  we entered into an expanded long term strategic supply and financing relationship with lucent 
in connection with that agreement  lucent has made financing available for the purchase of up to billion of equipment and related services necessary for the buildout of our network million of which was made immediately available 
at december   we had borrowed million under this financing arrangement 
in march  we sold  shares of our series d preferred stock for which we realized net proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  in march  we sold an aggregate of million principal amount of notes million of which pay interest and million of which defer interest  for which we realized net proceeds of approximately million 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses  due in large part to the development of our telecommunications services business  and we anticipate that such losses will continue over the near term as we execute our growth strategy 
we are building direct sales forces  having opened sales offices currently serving the major markets in which we offer our core telecommunications services  and we are expanding into other metropolitan areas 
we are in the process of ordering and installing switches and other network equipment to be placed in our key markets 
historically  we have funded our operating losses and capital expenditures through public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and from credit and lease facilities 
negative ebitda for the year ended december  was approximately million  and cash used to fund purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december  was approximately million 
at december   working capital was million including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  as compared to million at december  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
other than our equipment notes  our cash pay notes  and certain of our capital lease obligations  which require periodic cash interest payments  and the indebtedness incurred under the lucent financing arrangements  portions of which require cash payment of interest commencing in december  our principal indebtedness does not require us to pay cash interest until in july  we purchased from mfn an iru to dark fiber in and between a number of major markets at an aggregate cost of million 
amounts will become payable over the next eighteen months as portions of the fiber network are fully constructed and become available to us 
to date we have prepaid million of this amount 
in november  we signed a year lease for approximately  square feet of office space with options to lease approximately  additional square feet in new york city 
future minimum lease payments under this lease commitment are approximately million  which is comparable to what we would have paid for existing facilities and anticipated additions over the same year period 
we will consolidate certain of our existing new york city offices in the new space  including the headquarters for our corporate offices  winstar for buildings  winstar broadband services  winstar large accounts and operating offices for winstar general business and winstar network services 
we expect to sublease many of our existing offices in new york city 
in december  we signed a ten year lease for approximately  square feet of office space with a right of first refusal on substantial additional space in a building currently under construction located in herndon  virginia 
future minimum lease payments under this lease commitment are approximately million 
in december  we purchased from williams an iru to intercity fiber and an option to additional intercity capacity 
in connection with this purchase  williams will supply a substantial portion of our long haul transport until such time as construction of their facilities is completed 
we will pay williams an aggregate of approximately million over the next seven years for the fiber  option  long haul transport services and other network assets 
we can exercise the capacity option for approximately million 
we have the ability to moderate our capital spending and ebitda losses by varying the number of markets in which we build network and offer services 
in the event that we slow the speed or narrow the focus of our business plan  we will reduce our capital requirements and ebitda losses 
under our current plan to expand to major domestic and six international markets by the end of  we plan to spend between and million in for capital equipment  which we expect to finance principally through the lucent credit agreement and other vendor financing arrangements which we believe are available to us 
we anticipate  based on our business plan and related assumptions including an assumption of full availability of the billion under our lucent financing arrangement  that our existing financial resources and accounts receivable and additional equipment financings that we intend to seek  will be sufficient to fund our operations for approximately to months  and to fund our capital requirements for the next several years 
we may be required to seek additional sources of capital sooner than we anticipate if our operating assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  less than billion becomes available under the lucent credit agreement  we fail to secure additional equipment and accounts receivable financing  we consummate any acquisitions of significant businesses or assets including spectrum licenses  or we further accelerate our plan and enter markets more rapidly 
we continually evaluate the financing alternatives available to us and may decide to seek a variety of forms of additional debt and or equity financing in the near future 
year compliance we are continuing to address the issue of whether or to what extent our systems will be vulnerable to potential errors and failures as a result of the year problem  which is the result of certain computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four digits  to define the applicable year 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year  or not recognize the date at all 
this could result in major system failures or miscalculations 
we believe that our exposure to this issue  based on our internal systems  is somewhat limited by the fact that substantially all of our existing systems have been purchased or replaced since or currently remain under development 
notwithstanding this belief  we have developed a plan and we are aggressively working to identify and remediate potential year problems in all of our new and existing mission critical and business critical systems and applications  including those supplied by third party vendors 
our first priority is to protect customer sensitive operations from service interruptions or billing discrepancies that could occur as a result of the year transition 
customer sensitive mission critical operations include our telecommunications network  traffic data  customer order processing and provisioning systems  customer billing and invoicing  and data interfaces to and from these systems 
our second priority is business critical operations including systems  applications and operations which do not directly impact the customer  but are essential to internal communications and our ability to run the business day to day 
finally  we are addressing areas where failure might cause inconvenience and delay for our employees  but would not directly impact customers  service or routine business operations 
we have developed year compliance standards that follow industry requirements 
in order to implement these standards  we have formed a year program office to manage the year project plan enterprise wide 
the project team is comprised of management and technical representatives from our major operational areas  together with experienced year consultants 
key activities in our year program include planning and program definition  inventory and prioritization of date sensitive systems including computer and electrical systems  equipment and the systems of companies acquired or to be acquired by us  risk assessment  remediation  testing  audit and certification  contingency planning  implementation and post implementation monitoring 
we have completed the planning and inventory assessment phases of this project which entailed  among other things  identification of the several hundred systems we use in the operation of our business  and review all of our hardware and software systems for date related code issues 
the results of this review are guiding our remediation  testing and contingency planning efforts which are underway 
we have been undertaking certain year testing and remediation of non compliant systems which will continue through we recognize the need to remediate and test our mission critical and business critical systems to ensure that individually the systems are year functional and that collectively they inter operate in such a manner as to insure that we are year functional 
we expect to complete the individual testing of mission critical and business critical systems prior to june  we expect to start inter operability testing prior to june  and to complete that phase prior to august  this project will necessarily be a continuing one as remediated systems are monitored for compliance and as further modifications are warranted to cover systems changes and to support the growth of the network 
we have  where deemed necessary  required suppliers and third party vendors to provide statements of year compliance in their contracts with us 
in addition  and as part of our year project  we are contacting our vendors and suppliers  including other telecommunications providers  equipment manufacturers and software vendors  to obtain a statement regarding their year compliance 
we currently require our outside vendors and suppliers to provide reasonable assurances that their hardware and or software is year ready 
in the event that a vendor or supplier is not able to provide such assurance  we will monitor the vendor s progress in this area and  if appropriate may arrange to have available an alternate vendor or supplier who can give such assurances 
the total cost associated with our year compliance project is not expected to be material to our financial position 
the estimated total cost of the project is million to million 
the total amount expended through the date hereof was approximately million 
as additional systems are reviewed and tested and the scope of any year issues is further defined  we will make appropriate adjustments to the estimated costs of completing this project 
our failure to make our key systems year compliant could adversely impact our ability to service our telecommunications and other customers and otherwise carry on our business 
such problems could include interruptions in the operation of our telecommunications network  traffic data  customer order processing and provisioning systems  customer billing and invoicing  and data interfaces to and from these systems 
although we expect that we will have identified and remediated any year problems in our internal systems prior to the end of  if any significant year problems in our systems are not uncovered or are not remediated in a timely manner  significant failures of these functions could occur and could have material adverse consequences for our operations 
while we are working to test our own mission critical systems for year problems  we do not control the systems of our suppliers 
as discussed above  we are seeking assurances from our suppliers regarding the year readiness of their systems 
we also plan to conduct interoperability testing to determine whether our mission critical suppliers systems will accurately provide our systems with date  data and telecommunications functionality into and beyond the new millennium 
notwithstanding these measures  there is some risk that the interoperation of our systems with those of our suppliers may be impacted by the year date change 
in addition  in light of the vast interconnection and interoperability of telecommunications networks worldwide  the ability of any telecommunications provider  including winstar  to provide services to its customers eg  to complete calls and transport data and to bill for such services is dependent  to some extent  on the networks and systems of other carriers 
to the extent the networks and systems of those carriers are adversely impacted by year problems  our ability to service our customers may be adversely impacted as well 
any such impact could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we also may consummate acquisitions prior to the end of the extent of the year problems associated with any acquired company and the cost and timing of remediation will be evaluated during and after completion of the acquisition process 
however  we cannot be certain that the systems of any acquired company will be fully year compliant when acquired or will be capable of timely remediation 
having identified our mission critical and business critical systems and our key suppliers  and the associated risks of failure of those systems to be year ready  we are in the process of devising contingency plans which will be ready for implementation by the third quarter of in the event we determine that any of those systems will not be made year compliant in a timely manner 
effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements the american institute of certified public accountant s accounting standards executive committee recently issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires that costs of start up activities  including organization costs  be expensed as incurred 
start up activities are broadly defined and include one time activities related to opening a new facility  introducing a new product or service  conducting business in a new territory  conducting business with a new class of customer or beneficiary  initiating a new process in an existing facility  commencing some new operation and organizing a new entity 
sop is generally effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december   with initial application reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we are currently evaluating the impact that sop will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which requires entities to recognize all derivatives in their financial statements as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
sfas also specifies new methods of accounting for hedging transactions  prescribes the items and transactions that may be hedged and specifies detailed criteria to be met to qualify for hedge accounting 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
however  hedging is prohibited under the company s indentures 
forward looking statements this report contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to our financial condition  results of operations and business 
the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  plan  intend and similar expressions  as they relate to us  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
we cannot assure you that any of our expectations will be realized 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements include  without limitation our ability to service our debt or to obtain financing for the buildout of our domestic and international telecommunications networks  our ability to attract and retain a sufficient revenue generating customer base  competitive pressures in the telecommunications and technology industries  and general economic conditions
