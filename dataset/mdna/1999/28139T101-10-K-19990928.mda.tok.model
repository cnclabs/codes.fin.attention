unless otherwise specified  any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended june background edmc is one of the largest providers of proprietary postsecondary education in the united states  based on student enrollments and revenues 
through its operating units  primarily the art institutes  the company offers bachelor s and associate s degree programs and non degree programs in the areas of design  media arts  culinary arts  fashion and paralegal studies 
the company has provided career oriented education programs for over years  and its schools have graduated more than  students 
as of june   the company operated schools in major metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
net revenues  income before interest and taxes and net income increased in each of the last two years 
net revenues are presented after deducting refunds  scholarships and other adjustments 
net revenues increased to million in from million in income before interest and taxes increased to million in from million in net income increased by to million in from million in average quarterly student enrollments at the company s schools were  in compared to  in the increase in average enrollments relates to  among other factors  new education programs and additional school locations  along with expanded bachelor s degree and evening degree program offerings 
the company s revenues consist of tuition and fees  student housing fees and student supply store and restaurant sales 
in  the company derived of its net revenues from net tuition and fees paid by  or on behalf of  its students 
tuition revenue generally varies  based on the average tuition charge per credit hour and the average student population 
student supply store and housing revenue is largely a function of the average student population 
the average student population is influenced by the number of continuing students attending school at the beginning of a fiscal period and by the number of new students entering school during such period 
new students enter the art institutes at the beginning of each academic quarter  which typically commence in january  april  july and october 
the company believes that the size of its student population is influenced by the number of graduating high school students  the attractiveness of its program offerings  the effectiveness of its marketing efforts  changes in technology  the persistence of its students  the length of its education programs and general economic conditions 
the introduction of additional program offerings at existing schools and the establishment of new schools through acquisition or start up are important factors influencing the company s average student population 
tuition increases have been implemented in varying amounts in each of the past several years 
historically  the company has been able to pass along cost increases through increases in tuition 
the company believes that it can continue to increase tuition as educational costs at other postsecondary institutions  both public and private  continue to rise 
the company s schools implemented tuition rate increases averaging approximately during tuition rates have generally been consistent across the company s schools and programs 
however  as the company enters more markets in different geographic regions  tuition rates across company schools might not remain consistent 
the majority of students at the art institutes rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  especially title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
for the year ended june   approximately of the company s net revenues was indirectly derived from title iv programs 
educational services expense consists primarily of costs related to the development  delivery and administration of the company s education programs 
major cost components are faculty compensation  administrative salaries  costs of educational materials  facility and school occupancy costs  information systems costs  bad debt expense and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment 
during  the company s faculty comprised approximately full time and approximately part time employees 
in  these same percentages were and  respectively 
general and administrative expense consists of marketing and student admissions expenses and certain central staff departmental costs such as executive management  finance and accounting  legal and corporate development and other departments that do not provide direct services to the company s students 
the company has centralized many of these services to gain consistency in management reporting  efficiency in administrative effort and control of costs 
amortization of intangibles relates to the values assigned to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
these intangible assets arose principally from the application of purchase accounting to the establishment and financing of the esop and the related leveraged transaction in october and the acquisitions of the schools discussed below 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in august  the company purchased certain assets of nyrs for approximately million 
the company acquired current assets net of specified current liabilities  property and equipment and certain other intangible assets

the company also entered into a consulting agreement with its former president in exchange for an option to purchase  shares of common stock 
the school was renamed the art institutes international at san francisco 
in february  the company acquired certain assets related to the operations of bassist college in portland  oregon  for approximately million in cash 
the purchase agreement provides for additional consideration based upon a specified percentage of gross revenues over the next five years 
the school was renamed the art institutes international at portland 
in october  the company acquired the assets of socrates distance learning technologies group for approximately million in cash 
this acquisition was made to further the development of the company s distance learning capabilities 
the company employs the previous owners under two year employment and non compete arrangements 
start up schools and smaller acquisitions are expected to incur operating losses during the first two to three years following their opening or purchase 
the combined operating losses of the company s newer schools were approximately million in results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationships of certain income statement items to net revenues

net income net income increased by million or to million in from million in the increase resulted from improved operations at the company s schools owned prior to and reduced net interest expense  partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes 
seasonality and other factors affecting quarterly results the company s quarterly revenues and income fluctuate primarily as a result of the pattern of student enrollments 
the company experiences a seasonal increase in new enrollments in the fall fiscal year second quarter  which is traditionally when the largest number of new high school graduates begin postsecondary education 
some students choose not to attend classes during summer months  although the company s schools encourage year round attendance 
as a result  total student enrollments at the company s schools are highest in the fall quarter and lowest in the summer months fiscal year first quarter 
the company s costs and expenses  however  do not fluctuate as significantly as revenues on a quarterly basis 
the company anticipates that the seasonal pattern in revenues and earnings will continue in the future

liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s cash flow from operations has been the primary source of financing for capital expenditures and growth 
cash flow from operations was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for the year ended june   cash flow from operations and cash flow from investing activities are reflected net of approximately million of capital expenditures included in accounts payable as of june  as a result of the significant increase in capital expenditures  the company had net working capital of million as of june   down from million as of june  as of june   gross trade accounts receivable increased by million  or  to million from the prior year as a result of the increased net revenues 
the allowance for doubtful accounts increased by million  or  to million in from million in debt service the company s amended and restated credit agreement  dated march   as amended the revolving credit agreement  currently allows for maximum borrowings of million  reduced annually by million  through its expiration on october  borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at one of three rates set forth in the revolving credit agreement at the election of the company 
certain outstanding letters of credit reduce the facility 
as of june   the company had approximately million of additional borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement contains customary covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain specified levels of consolidated net worth and meet specified interest  leverage and fixed charge ratio requirements  and restrict repurchases of common stock and the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness 
as of june   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit agreement 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are used by the company primarily to fund its occasional working capital needs  arising from the seasonal pattern of cash receipts throughout the year 
the level of accounts receivable reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition and fees at the beginning of each academic quarter 
collection of these receivables is heaviest at the start of each academic quarter 
future financing and cash flows the company believes that cash flow from operations  supplemented from time to time by borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations  planned expansion to new locations  planned capital expenditures and debt service during the term of the revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures capital expenditures made during the three years ended june  reflect the implementation of the company s initiatives emphasizing the addition of new schools and programs and investment in classroom technology 
during  the company purchased buildings in denver  ft 
lauderdale  pittsburgh and seattle 
the buildings in ft 
lauderdale and seattle were previously leased 
the real estate purchases in denver and pittsburgh will become  after completion of renovations  the new facilities of the colorado institute of art and the art institute of pittsburgh 
the aggregate purchase price and costs of subsequent improvements made during the fiscal year related to the buildings acquired was approximately million 
the company s capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
exclusive of the real estate purchases and related improvements  the company expects that total capital spending for will increase as a percentage of net revenues  as compared to the anticipated expenditures relate principally to the introduction and expansion of culinary programs  further investment in schools acquired or started during the previous four years and anticipated to be added in  continued improvements to the facilities currently under construction  additional or replacement school and housing facilities and classroom technology 
the company leases the majority of its facilities 
future commitments on existing leases will be paid from cash provided by operating activities 
regulation the company indirectly derived approximately of its net revenues from title iv programs in us department of education regulations prescribe the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year 
lenders in multiple disbursements each academic year generally provide loan funds 
for first time students in their first academic quarter  the initial loan disbursement is generally received at least days after the commencement of that academic quarter 
otherwise  the first loan disbursement is received  at the earliest  days before the commencement of the student s academic quarter 
us department of education regulations require title iv program funds received by the company s schools in excess of the tuition and fees owed by the relevant students at that time to be  with these students permission  maintained and classified as restricted until they are billed for the portion of their education program related to those funds 
funds transferred through electronic funds transfer programs are held in a separate cash account and released when certain conditions are satisfied 
these restrictions have not significantly affected the company s ability to fund daily operations 
effective july  postsecondary education institutions became subject to changes in the delivery of ffel program proceeds 
prior to july  certain schools delivered ffel proceeds for an academic year typically three quarters to students in two equal disbursements 
the change resulted in ffel proceeds being delivered equally in each of the academic quarters 
some of the company s schools began to deliver loan proceeds in this manner prior to the change in regulation becoming effective 
education institutions participating in title iv programs must satisfy a series of specific standards of financial responsibility 
under regulations that took effect in july  the us department of education has adopted standards replacing the former acid test  tangible net worth test and two year operating loss test to determine an institution s financial responsibility to participate in title iv programs 
the regulations establish three ratios i the equity ratio  measuring an institution s capital resources  ability to borrow and financial viability  ii the primary reserve ratio  measuring an institution s ability to support current operations from expendable resources  and iii the net income ratio  measuring an institution s profitability 
each ratio is calculated separately  based on the figures in the institution s most recent annual audited financial statements  and then weighted and combined to arrive at a single composite score 
such composite score must be at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without conditions or additional oversight 
regulations promulgated under the hea also require all proprietary education institutions to comply with the rule  previously referred to as the rule  which prohibits participating schools from deriving or more of total revenue from title iv programs in any year 
if an institution fails to meet any of these requirements  it may be deemed to be not financially responsible by the us department of education  or otherwise ineligible to participate in title iv programs 
the company believes that all of its participating schools met these requirements as of june  effect of inflation the company does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
impact of new accounting standards in june  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
this statement has been amended by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of sfas no 
sfas no 
will be effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not anticipate that these standards will have a significant impact on its financial statements 
year issues the problem the year problem arises from the fact that many existing information technology it hardware and software systems and non information technology non it products containing embedded microchip processors were originally programmed to represent any date with six digits eg   as opposed to eight digits eg  
accordingly  problems may arise for many such products and systems when attempting to process information containing dates that fall after december  as a result  many such products and systems could experience miscalculations  malfunctions or disruptions 
this problem is commonly referred to as the year problem  and the acronym yk is commonly substituted for the phrase year at this time  the company believes that all of the significant internal it and non it systems with potential yk problems have been repaired  replaced or upgraded in order to avoid any major business interruption from yk issues 
the company s state of readiness for its year issues as a result of the company s software upgrades and computer system purchases over the past few years  a substantial number of edmc s computer systems should not have a yk problem ie  are yk compliant or have been warranted to be yk compliant by third party vendors 
the company created a task force the yk task force which has members from the company s significant operating areas 
the yk task force implemented a program  the goal of which was to assess the potential exposure of each such area to the yk problem  the first phase of edmc s overall yk program  and  as the second phase thereof  designed a coordinated plan to determine whether any such potential exposure would result in a problem that would require some remediation 
as each such area s yk problems have been identified  the third phase has been to formulate proposals to determine the best course of action to address each such problem  implement the solution and develop contingency plans to the extent possible and necessary 
the final phase of the overall yk program is both independent and coordinated testing to ensure yk compliance in each operating area 
the yk task force has the responsibility for addressing any yk problems in either it or non it systems 
the company has completed the assessment inventory phase for its it systems  including its accounting  human resources  admissions  education  student financial services and student services systems 
the yk task force reports that testing of edmc s most critical it systems is substantially completed 
the yk task force has also substantially finished its identification of non it systems that may have yk problems  and has sent inquiries to the entities that own or control any of those non it systems  including elevators  electricity  telephones  security systems and hvac systems  that could have a material impact on the company s operations  such as the owners of the buildings and other facilities that house or service the company s schools and administrative offices 
the yk task force has also identified those third parties  such as governmental and other regulatory agencies  guaranty agencies  software and hardware suppliers  telephone companies  significant vendors and external file exchange system providers  whose yk compliance or lack thereof may pose problems for the company 
pursuant to the yk task force s plan  inquiries have been sent to those third parties 
all entities have responded with yk compliance plans that appear to be adequate 
however  the company can not independently verify each agency 
the costs to address the company s year issues to date  the company has incurred approximately  of costs directly associated with its efforts to address its yk issues 
this amount does not include an allocation of salaries of edmc personnel participating in this effort 
nor does it include recent hardware  software  or systems purchases which are  or have been  warranted to be yk compliant 
based upon its current understanding of the company s yk issues  the yk task force anticipates additional direct costs ranging from  to  will be incurred to address these issues 
this represents a reduction from previous estimates ranging to  of the remaining cost to be incurred  approximately  will be used  if necessary  to replace technology hardware and software at company schools   is budgeted for contingency plan implementation  if necessary 
the company plans to charge its direct yk expenses to its information systems budget 
all yk related expenditures are expensed as incurred 
risks related to the company s year issues the company has identified several possible worst case scenarios that could arise because of yk issues  however  at this time  the company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the likelihood of any of these worst case scenarios 
it should be noted that the company s schools will not be in session on december  or january   with classes resuming in mid january the company has shifted resources to the resolution of yk issues 
this has resulted in the deferral of some existing or contemplated projects  particularly computer system oriented projects 
although the company is unable at this time to quantify its internal  indirect costs resulting from such changes  with its resultant deferral of projects  management believes that the cost of remediating the company s internal yk problems will not have a material adverse impact upon its business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
because the company is in a regulated industry and relies  indirectly  on only a few sources for a substantial portion of its revenues  edmc s business is very dependent upon those entities efforts to address their own yk issues 
the yk task force has identified those third parties whose failure to resolve their own yk issues could have a material impact upon the company s operations  and is taking steps it currently believes appropriate to analyze both such parties yk status and the company s options in the event that any such party is not yk compliant in sufficient time prior to december  should any such third parties experience yk related disruptions  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
for example  as with all postsecondary education oriented businesses whose students receive governmental financial aid  the company s operations and liquidity depend upon the student funding provided by title iv programs for its students 
the us department of education s computer systems handle processing of applications for this funding 
the us department of education has stated that its systems are yk compliant 
the company has successfully completed file exchange tests with the us department of education 
any problems with the us department of education s systems could result in an interruption in the funding for students nationwide  including the company s students 
any prolonged interruption could have a material adverse impact upon the education industry and  accordingly  upon the company s business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
similarly  the company s schools are licensed by one or more agencies in the states in which they are based and accredited by one or more accrediting bodies that are recognized by the us department of education 
the company continues to assess the yk readiness of these agencies and bodies 
in the event that any of these entities are unable  due to yk problems  to renew a school s license or accreditation  an interruption in such school s operations could occur 
depending upon the school involved  a prolonged interruption could have a material adverse impact upon the company s business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
five guaranty agencies provide the vast majority of the guarantees for the loans issued to the company s students under title iv programs 
the company has completed file exchange tests successfully with the agency that accounts for approximately of those guarantees 
the company is investigating all these agencies to determine whether they will be yk compliant or whether contingency plans need to be made with respect thereto 
as with the us department of education  the company is unable to assess independently the readiness of any of these agencies at the present time  although all such agencies have reported that they are yk compliant 
the majority of the title iv program loans to the company s students are funded through six banks  five of which work with the company s primary guaranty agency 
the five lenders that work with that agency use an affiliate of that agency to disburse and service their loans  and the company has successfully completed file exchange tests with the affiliated agency 
the company is exploring as a contingency plan the availability of other lenders that have stated that they expect to be yk compliant 
the company has also reviewed the yk compliance efforts of its transfer agent and of the nasdaq national market system and does not anticipate any serious disruptions in service from these providers 
the yk task force has made inquiries of the major financial institutions and utilities that provide services to the company and continues to assess the potential effects of those entities failures to become yk compliant within the time remaining 
if  notwithstanding any such entity s representations that it will be yk compliant in time  it is not compliant  the company s business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected 
contingency plans the yk task force s responsibilities include developing contingency plans for each of edmc s significant operating areas 
these contingency plans would be utilized in the event that  despite the company s best efforts  or due to the company s lack of control over certain third parties  a system is not yk compliant and edmc s business is adversely affected 
each operating area is preparing a contingency plan to operate for up to three consecutive days without standard computer support 
in addition  the company maintains a hot site contract with hewlett packard that allows it to run its day to day central computer operations from a remote location in washington state 
the hot site is a contingency against a regional yk failure that would cause business interruptions at the company s corporate offices in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
the yk task force expects to have substantially all of its contingency plans in place by december  risk factors in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the following factors  among others  could affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects in fiscal and later years i the perceptions of the us congress  the us department of education and the public concerning proprietary postsecondary education institutions to the extent those perceptions could result in changes in the hea in connection with its reauthorization  ii edmc s ability to comply with federal and state regulations and accreditation standards  including any changes therein or changes in the interpretation thereof  iii the company s capability to foresee changes in the skills required of its graduates and to design new courses and programs to develop those skills  iv the ability of the company to gauge successfully which markets are underserved in the skills that the company s schools teach  v the company s ability to gauge appropriate acquisition and start up opportunities and to manage and integrate them successfully  vi the company s ability to defend litigation successfully  and vii competitive pressures from other educational institutions 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the fair values and carrying amounts of the company s financial instruments  primarily accounts receivable and debt  are approximately equivalent 
the debt instruments bear interest at floating rates based upon market rates or at fixed rates that approximate market rates 
all other financial instruments are classified as current and will be utilized within the next operating cycle
