item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company has market risk exposure to changing interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposure based on market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
at december   the fair value of the company s total long term debt is approximately million  using yields obtained for similar types of borrowing arrangements and taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical ten percent decrease in interest rates and amounts to  at december  at december   the company had million of variable rate debt 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps which convert floating rates to fixed rates for a total notional amount of million 
if interest rates on the company s variable rate debt  after considering interest rate swaps  were to increase by ten percent from their year end rates for the whole of  the increase in interest expense for would be approximately  the potential change in fair value of the company s interest rate swaps resulting from a hypothetical ten percent decrease in interest rates would not be material to the company s financial position at december  commodity derivative product exposure the company has market risk exposure to changing diesel fuel prices

if the fuel index on which these derivatives are based were to decrease ten percent from its year end level for the whole of  the company would have an increase in fuel expense for the year of  as a result of the fuel price swaps on the notional  gallons per month
