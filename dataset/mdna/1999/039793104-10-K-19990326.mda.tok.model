item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the combined financial statements of the arden predecessors and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
since our initial public offering in october  we have pursued a strategy of acquiring under performing commercial properties  properties in need of renovation  properties which provide attractive yields with stable cash flow  and more recently  fully entitled commercial undeveloped real estate  all in southern california submarkets where we can utilize our local market expertise 
we have also used our active in house management  leasing and finance expertise to maximize growth in cash flow 
in particular  for the year ended december   we have raised approximately million of equity in a series of four public offerings 
proceeds from these offerings  net of underwriters discount  advisory fees and offering costs aggregating approximately million  were approximately million 
acquired commercial properties  with million rentable square feet for approximately billion 
acquired the undeveloped commercial property portions of the acre howard hughes center and a building containing an executive health and athletic club tenant the center for approximately million 
the center  located in west los angeles  california  is a mixed use development currently containing three office buildings  the building containing the health and athletic club tenant and entitlements for an additional million square feet of office space 
refinanced million of variable rate mortgage debt that matured on july  the lehman bridge loan ii  with two fixed rate mortgage loans totaling million 
in october  we borrowed an additional million under one of these mortgage loans to repay outstanding indebtedness and reduced the annual fixed rate from to on million of these borrowings 
increased the operating margin from our properties by over in to from in increased the total occupancy in our portfolio by excluding the six properties under renovation  that included net absorption of approximately  square feet 
we intend to continue focusing on maximizing growth in cash flow and on enhancing the value of our portfolio of commercial properties 
these objectives will be pursued by active management of our existing portfolio and by acquisitions of underperforming office and industrial properties  properties in need of renovation and properties that provide attractive yields with stable cash flows in submarkets where we can utilize our local market expertise 
we may also continue to develop new properties when market conditions permit in submarkets where we have extensive local market expertise 
recent developments in january  along with lowe enterprise as the construction manager  we commenced construction on a  square foot office building at howard hughes center that is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of on january  the lehman bridge loan i was expanded to million 
pursuant to the fifth amendment to the lehman bridge loan i  the loan bears interest at libor plus per annum effective rate of at january   requires monthly payments of interest only  and matures on april  on february  we executed a million loan commitment with mass mutual life insurance company the mass mutual loan 
the mass mutual loan is secured by properties  has a ten year term and bears interest at a fixed rate of including the amortization of loan fees and requires monthly payments of principal and interest amortized over a year period 
the estimated funding date for the mass mutual loan is march  proceeds from this loan will be used to repay a portion of our lines of credit and the lehman bridge loan i 
results of operations our financial position and operating results are primarily comprised of our portfolio of commercial properties and income derived therefrom 
therefore  financial data from period to period will be affected by the timing of significant property acquisitions 
due to arden realty s and the arden predecessors aggressive acquisition program through  there has been significant variability in financial data from period to period

comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  in thousands 
we believe for a meaningful analysis of the financial statements to be made  certain transactions which occurred in should be considered in a manner which makes each accounting period comparable 
accordingly  the revenue and expenses for certain noncombined entities for the period from january  to october  have been included as though they were combined  with intercompany management fees relating to the noncombined entities of  eliminated in in the following discussion

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of net proceeds from mortgage loans  unsecured lines of credit and the issuance of  shares of common stock  partially offset by distributions to shareholders and minority interests 
capital commitments as of december  we had approximately million outstanding in capital commitments related to tenant improvements  renovation costs  and property related capital expenditures 
available borrowings  cash balance and capital resources we have a million unsecured line of credit the amended credit facility from a group of banks led by wells fargo 
the amended credit facility bears interest at a rate ranging between libor plus and libor plus effective rate of at december  depending on the leverage ratio of the company 
if we achieve an investment grade unsecured debt rating  the interest rate may be lowered to between libor plus and libor plus depending on the debt rating 
under certain circumstances  we have the option to convert the interest rate from libor to the prime rate plus 
in addition  the amended credit facility has a commitment fee ranging from 
to 
on the unused balance 
the amended credit facility matures on june  as of december   the aggregate outstanding balance on the amended credit facility was million  and million was available for additional borrowing 
proceeds from the amended credit facility have been used  among other things  to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and provide for working capital and other corporate purposes 
we also have an unsecured line of credit with a total commitment of million from city national bank the city national bank credit facility 
the city national bank credit facility accrues interest at the city national bank prime rate less effective rate of at december   and is scheduled to mature on august  proceeds from the city national bank credit facility will be used  among other things  to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures and provide for working capital and other corporate purposes 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance on the city national bank credit facility 
on june  we repaid  through two special purpose subsidiaries  our million lehman bridge loan ii with two new mortgage loans totaling million 
the additional proceeds were used to repay million on our lines of credit and to repay million on the lehman bridge loan i 
the million mortgage financing iii and million mortgage financing iv mortgage loans payable to an affiliate of lehman brothers are non recourse and secured by fully cross collateralized and cross defaulted first mortgage liens on and of our properties mortgage financing iii  and iv  properties  respectively 
the mortgage financing iii and iv mortgage loans each have a thirty year term  bear interest at a fixed rate of including the amortization of costs associated with the settlement of a related treasury rate lock agreement and amortization of related loan fees per annum  require interest only payments through april  and thereafter require monthly payments of principal and interest amortized over a year period through maturity and are anticipated to be repaid within ten years of issuance 
if the mortgage financing iii and iv mortgage loans are not repaid within ten years of issuance  the interest rate will increase by at least per annum and all excess cash flow as defined from the mortgage financing iii and iv properties must be used to pay down outstanding principal 
the mortgage financing iii and iv mortgage loans require us to maintain a cash reserve for tenant improvements of approximately million and million  respectively  and to comply with certain customary financial covenants  ongoing operational restrictions  and certain cash management procedures 
in october  pursuant to the execution of certain leasing transactions  we borrowed an additional million and reduced the annual fixed rate to under the mortgage financing iv loan 
in connection with the mortgage financing iii and iv mortgage loans  we entered into a treasury rate lock agreement the swap agreement with a notional amount of million and locked in the united states year treasury rate at 
on april  we settled the swap agreement for million and are amortizing the cost of settling the swap agreement over the term of the related mortgage loans payable

as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  including million in restricted cash  representing interest bearing cash deposits required by three of our mortgage loans payable 
in addition  we had million in cash impound accounts for real estate taxes and insurance as required by several of our mortgage loans payable 
as of december   we had million available under our lines of credit and the capacity to issue up to million of our common stock pursuant to a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in january on january   the lehman bridge loan i was expanded to million 
pursuant to the fifth amendment to the lehman bridge loan i  the loan bears interest at libor plus per annum effective rate of on january   requires monthly payments of interest only  and matures on april  on february   we executed a million loan commitment with mass mutual life insurance company the mass mutual loan 
the mass mutual loan is secured by properties  has a ten year term and bears interest at a fixed rate of including the amortization of loan fees and requires monthly payments of principal and interest totaling  and is amortized over a year period 
the estimated funding date for the mass mutual loan is march  proceeds from this loan will be used to repay a portion of our lines of credit and the lehman bridge loan i 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our net cash provided by operating activities and from proceeds from our lines of credit 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to pay any distributions necessary to enable us to continue qualifying as a reit 
we also believe that the foregoing sources of capital will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  including recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet certain long term liquidity and capital requirements such as scheduled debt payments  renovation costs  property acquisitions and other non recurring capital expenditures through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  to be a useful financial measure of the operating performance for an equity reit 
we believe that funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance 
the following table reflects the calculation of our funds from operations for the years ended december  and and for the period october  to december  and for the arden predecessors for the period january  to october  in thousands arden realty  inc 
arden predecessors for the years ended for the period for the period december  october  january  to to december  october  funds from operations net income loss     depreciation and amortization     minority interest  a  loss on valuation of derivative  funds from operations    company s share percentage company s share of funds from operations    a excludes  in distributions made to the former minority partners in the world savings center office property 
the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of nareit in march the white paper defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and unusual items  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we consider funds from operations an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on cash flow analyses 
we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the white paper which may differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
impact of year any of our computer programs that have date sensitive software may not be able to distinguish the year from the year if those programs use two digits rather than four digits to define the year 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send tenant invoices  provide services to our properties and tenants  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the accounting software we are currently using is not year compliant 
however  we have completed an assessment of our accounting software needs and have elected to install a different accounting software package that is both year compliant and provides other features not available with our current software package 
we plan to install the year compliant version of this software in the second and third quarters of we estimate the total costs associated with installing this year compliant accounting software to be between  to  the hardware used to run our accounting software is year compliant 
we have completed an inventory of the computer hardware and software collectively  the system components used to run the operating systems ie security  energy  elevator and safety at our properties 
this process included determining which system components are date sensitive 
we have also contacted the manufacturers of the date sensitive system components to determine if they are year compliant 
we plan to test the date sensitive system components represented to be year compliant  and reprogram or replace the date sensitive system components found not be year compliant by the end of the third quarter of we estimate the total costs associated with this phase of our year program to be between  and  we believe our principal risks associated with the year issue include the risk of disruption of our operations due to operational failures of third parties  including tenants  utility providers  vendors and financial institutions 
we are currently surveying material vendors and tenants regarding the year compliance status of their computer hardware and software 
we will review the results of this survey  assess the impact of the results on our operations and take whatever action is deemed necessary 
as this phase of our year program is not yet complete  we cannot presently assess the associated risks and estimated costs 
upon completion of our year readiness program  we will consider the necessity of implementing a contingency plan to mitigate any adverse effects associated with the year issue 
our ability to complete the year modifications outlined above prior to any anticipated impact on our operating systems is based on numerous assumptions of future events and is dependent upon numerous factors  including the ability of third party software and hardware manufacturers to make necessary modifications to current versions of their products  the availability of resources to install and test the modified systems and other factors 
accordingly  there can be no guarantee that these modifications will be successful 
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties  we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues 
the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities 
inflation our leases generally require tenants to pay a majority of property operating expenses in excess of base amounts 
the majority of our leases contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed or variable based on the consumer price index or other index 
accordingly  we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow are subject to any significant risk of inflation 
an increase in inflation  however  could result in an increase in our variable rate borrowing cost  including borrowings under our unsecured lines of credit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
interest rate risk in order to modify and manage the interest characteristics of our outstanding debt and limit the effects of interest rates on our operations  we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks such as counter party credit risk and legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
we do not enter into any transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
certain of our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market rates of interest  such as libor 
based on interest rates and outstanding balance at december   a increase in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on its fair value 
a decrease in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would increase annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million and would not have an impact on its fair value 
a increase or decrease in interest rates on our secured note receivable would not have a material impact on annual future earnings  cash flows and its fair value 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure
