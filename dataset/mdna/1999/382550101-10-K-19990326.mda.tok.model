year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any computer program that has date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal manufacturing or other business activities 
the company  on a coordinated basis and with the assistance of ibm and other consultants  is addressing the year issue 
the company has inventoried and assessed all date sensitive technical infrastructure and information and transaction processing computer systems i t systems and determined that a substantial portion of its software and some hardware must be modified or replaced 
plans are being implemented to correct and test all affected i t systems  with priorities assigned based on the importance of the activity 
the company has also inventoried and assessed its manufacturing and other operating systems that may be date sensitive process systems  including those that use embedded technology such as micro controllers and micro processors 
the company has identified substantially all of the software and hardware installations that will be necessary to achieve year compliance and has made substantial progress in repairing the existing and acquiring and installing the new i t systems and process systems necessary to achieve year compliance 
the company monitors its year compliance efforts with respect to i t systems and process systems in three phases the identification and inventory of date sensitive transactions  processes and systems the inventory phase  the determination of repairs and replacements required  if any  through testing  analysis and design the analysis phase  and the repair or acquisition  installation and testing of year compliant systems the remediation phase 
all i t systems and process systems are scheduled to have been repaired or acquired and installed  tested and determined to be year compliant by november of the company has completed the inventory phase and the analysis phase  and substantially completed the remediation phase  in respect of the critical i t systems  including its order entry  shipping and billing systems and technical infrastructure  and the critical process systems located in its tire manufacturing facilities 
the following table indicates the company s progress in its year compliance program 
estimated percentage of year compliance activity completed i t process systems systems inventory phase completed at analysis phase completed at remediation phase completed at the cost of repairing the company s existing i t systems that will be modified in order to achieve year compliance is estimated to be million to million  including the million expended in and the million expended during the remaining million to million will be spent during as the company completes the repair  installation and testing of software and hardware and  in a few instances  the purchase and installation of new hardware 
all of the costs of repairing such existing i t systems will be for consulting fees and software and hardware modifications  which costs have been and will be expensed in the period incurred 
the cost of new hardware has been and will be capitalized 
in addition  for several years the company  with the assistance of pricewaterhousecoopers llp and other consultants  has also been designing  acquiring and installing various business transaction processing i t systems 
the software and hardware purchased and installed in connection with these new i t systems in each case provide significant new functionality and  in some instances  will also replace non compliant i t systems with new year compliant i t systems 
due to the integrated nature of these i t systems enhancement projects  it is not practicable to segregate the costs associated with the elements of these new i t systems that may have been accelerated to facilitate year compliance 
the company estimates that prior to january  it will have spent approximately million to million for consulting  software and hardware costs incurred in connection with the i t systems enhancement projects in process since  of which amount approximately million has been expended through december   including million during the company anticipates that costs incurred in respect of such projects will be approximately million to million during through december   approximately million of these costs have been expensed and approximately million of these costs have been capitalized 
substantially all of the remaining consulting  software and hardware costs for these i t systems enhancement projects will be capitalized 
the company is modifying or replacing and testing its process systems at an anticipated cost of between million and million  substantially all of which is for the acquisition of replacement systems 
the cost of the process systems has been and will be capitalized 
through december   the cost of process systems installed by the company has totaled million  all of which was incurred during the company s year compliance cost including the cost of all i t systems enhancement projects are expected to total approximately million to million  of which amount million has been expended through december  all year costs have been and will be funded from operations 
for  costs for repairing existing i t systems for year compliance were approximately of the company s budget for information technology and it is expected that such year compliance efforts will represent approximately of the company s information technology budget during the total cost of repairing existing i t systems and of the i t systems enhancement projects represented of the company s information technology budget during and will represent approximately of its information technology budget 
while a few information technology projects have been deferred or reprioritized  the impact of any delays in implementing these projects due to year compliance efforts has not affected  and is not expected to affect  the company s financial condition or to have any significant impact on its results of operations during or thereafter 
the company has surveyed its significant suppliers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to their failure to correct their own year issues 
based on responses to its survey and other communications received to date  the company is able to assess the year readiness of approximately of its significant suppliers 
failure of the company s significant trading partners to address year issues could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations  although it is not possible at this time to quantify the amount of revenues and profits that might be lost  or the costs that could be incurred  by the company 
in addition  parts of the global infrastructure  including national banking systems  electrical power  transportation facilities  communications and governmental activities  may not be fully functional after failures in the global infrastructure could significantly reduce the company s ability to manufacture its products at affected locations and its ability to serve its customers as effectively as they are now being served 
the company reviews available information  including governmental and industry reports  regarding elements of the global infrastructure that may affect its operations  to evaluate their expected year readiness 
while the company believes its efforts to address the year issue will be successful in avoiding any material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition  it recognizes that failing to resolve year issues on a timely basis would  in a most reasonably likely worst case scenario  significantly limit its ability to manufacture and distribute certain of its products for a period of time  which is most likely to arise in the event of the failure of one or more significant suppliers or essential components of the global infrastructure  such as power sources 
the company is not able to estimate its lost revenues  lost profits and costs incurred in the event of the occurrence of the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
if the company s systems are not year compliant in a timely manner  the company may also incur liability for breach of contract or other harm 
it is not possible at this time to estimate either the risk of incurring any such liability or the nature or amount of any such liability 
the company has started its contingency planning for its critical operational areas that might be affected by the year issue if its compliance is delayed 
in early  the company will also review the extent to which contingency plans may be required for any suppliers  components of the global infrastructure or other third parties that fail to achieve year compliance 
the company s contingency plans were complete at december  and are expected to be completed by june  the contingency plans will include identification of critical processes  risk assessment and response techniques in the event of a system failure 
planned responses to system failures include emergency response teams designed to produce prompt corrective action  identification of alternate sources of supply  manual processing of transactions  manual control of production processes and the stock piling of raw materials and finished goods in those instances where a high risk of a supply failure is suspected 
in certain cases  especially global infrastructure failures  there may be no practical alternative course of action available to the company that will permit resumption of an interrupted business activity 
the foregoing discussion regarding year project timing  effectiveness  implementation and costs are based on management s current evaluation using available information 
factors that might cause material changes include  but are not limited to  the availability of key year personnel  the readiness of third parties  and the company s ability to respond to unforeseen year complications 
the euro effective january   member states of the european economic and monetary union converted to a common currency known as the euro 
modifications to certain of the company s information systems software were required in connection with this conversion 
the company has completed these modifications at a nominal cost  and does not anticipate that the conversion to the euro will have any significant operational impact 
additionally  the company does not expect the conversion to the euro to have a material impact on results of operations  financial position or liquidity of its european businesses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company actively manages its fixed and floating rate debt mix  within defined limitations  using refinancings and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
the company will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce the company s risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used by the company to separate interest rate risk management from the debt funding decision 
at december   the interest rate on of the company s debt was fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate contracts  compared to at december  the following tables present information at december in millions interest rate contracts fair value liability 
carrying amount liability 

pro forma fair value liability the pro forma information assumes a decrease in variable market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of contracts outstanding at that date under that assumption 
in millions fixed rate debt fair value liability carrying amount liability pro forma fair value liability the pro forma information assumes a basis point decrease in market interest rates at december of each year  and reflects the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding at that date under that assumption 
the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the company s interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt was determined with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis 
the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve  and the precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows  the company was a party to various foreign currency forward exchange contracts at december  and these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and the company s swiss franc debt 
the contract maturities match the maturities of the currency positions 
changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged positions
