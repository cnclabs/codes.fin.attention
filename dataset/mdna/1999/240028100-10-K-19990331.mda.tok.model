the swaps have a fixed ninety day libor component of and  and expire on november  the ninety day libor as of december  was 
all fluctuations in rates resulting from the swaps are accounted for as interest expense

symons is currently a defendant involved in a civil suit brought by efco corp  a competitor of symons in one portion of their business 
efco corp 
alleged that symons engaged in false advertising  misappropriation of trade secrets  intentional interference with contractual relations  and certain other activities 
after a jury trial  preliminary damages of approximately million were awarded against symons in january the company believes that there is no merit to these allegations  remains committed to vigorously pursuing post trial motions and appeals  and is seeking to vacate the judgments in their entirety 
the company believes that  in the event the judgments against it are not completely set aside  it has numerous substantial grounds for a successful appeal and intends to vigorously pursue its appellate rights 
a successful appeal could result in judgment for symons or a new trial 
symons liability  if any  cannot finally be determined until such time as all rights of the parties have been exhausted or have expired by lapse of time 
the company considers the outcome of this litigation to be not estimable 
accordingly  the company has not recorded any liability for the resolution of this suit 
in the event the company is unsuccessful in its post trial motions and appeals  it may have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company believes its liquidity  capital resources and cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  working capital requirements and debt service in the absence of additional acquisitions 
the company intends to fund future acquisitions with cash  securities or a combination of cash and securities 
to the extent the company uses cash for all or part of any such acquisitions  it expects to raise such cash primarily from cash generated from operations  borrowings under the credit facility or  if feasible and attractive  issuances of long term debt or additional class a common shares 
seasonality the company s operations are seasonal in nature  with approximately of sales historically occurring in the second and third quarters 
working capital and borrowings fluctuate with sales volume 
historically  more than of cash flow from operations is generated in the fourth quarter 
inflation the company does not believe inflation had a significant impact on its operations over the past three years 
in the past  the company has been able to pass along all or a portion of the effects of steel price increases 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to pass on the cost of such increases in the future 
year certain software and hardware systems are date sensitive 
older date sensitive systems often use a two digit dating convention rather than that could result in system failure and disruption of operations as the year approaches 
this is referred to as the year issue 
the year issue will impact the company  its suppliers  customers and other third parties that transact business with the company 
the company has a year compliance team 
this team is reviewing substantially all hardware and software systems within the company  products sold by the company  and significant suppliers and other third parties that transact business with the company 
projects have been established to address all significant year issues identified in this review 
the year team reports regularly to senior management on the progress of significant year projects 
senior management reports to the board of directors on the company s progress with year projects 
the compliance review has involved testing of hardware and software systems  including non information technology systems such as telephones and computer numeric controlled machines 
the company has determined that it needs to replace or modify some of its software and hardware systems 
the company is replacing or upgrading most of the systems which have been identified as having year issues 
the company believes it has no material exposure to contingencies related to the year issue for products sold as almost none of the company s products contain time sensitive hardware or software systems 
the company has initiated communications with significant suppliers  customers and other relevant third parties to identify and minimize disruptions to the company s operations and to assist in resolving year issues 
particular attention has been given to those suppliers who may be the company s only source for certain products or components 
however  there can be no certainty that the impacted systems and products of other parties on which the company relies will be year compliant 
the company s estimates of year costs are based on numerous assumptions  actual costs could be greater than estimates 
specific factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  the continuing availability of personnel trained in this area and the company s ability to timely identify and correct all relevant software and hardware systems and the success of third party vendors in addressing their own year issues 
to date  the company has incurred approximately thousand  of which thousand was capitalized and thousand was expensed 
these costs were to replace existing hardware and third party software and professional fees for external assistance 
the estimated future cost for resolving year issues is approximately thousand  of which thousand is expected to be capitalized and thousand is expected to be expensed 
these costs are to replace or upgrade existing hardware and third party software  including professional fees for external assistance 
the company believes it is diligently addressing the year issues and that it will satisfactorily resolve all significant year problems 
the company successfully completed a test of its integrated systems in the fourth quarter of and anticipates completing substantially all of its year projects by the end of the second quarter of in the event the company falls short of these milestones  additional internal resources will be focused on completing these projects or implementing contingency plans 
the company believes that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be related to the lack of success of third party vendors of addressing their year issues  particularly suppliers who are the company s only source  such as local electricity providers 
if a facility were to be unable to manufacture products due to a lack of electricity  contingency plans include the transfer of production orders to other facilities 
the company believes the impact would not be significant due to the seasonal capacity that exists in january

the company generally does not use finanical instruments to manage its exposure to changes in commodity prices
