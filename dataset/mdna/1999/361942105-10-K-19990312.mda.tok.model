liquidity and capital resources the company has incurred significant operating and net losses as a result of the development and operation of its networks 
the company expects that such losses will continue as the company emphasizes the development  construction and expansion of its networks and builds its customer base 
cash provided by the company s operations will not be sufficient to fund the expansion of its networks  longhaul fiber optic facilities and services 
at december   the company had approximately  million of indebtedness outstanding and million of mandatorily redeemable preference shares 
although the company s liquidity was substantially improved as a result of proceeds received from the sale of the notes  the secured notes  the accrual notes and the notes  the company has significant debt service obligations 
the company will be required to make principal and interest payments of approximately million of which million will be made from funds securing the secured notes  million of which million will be made from funds securing the secured notes  million  million and million in    and  respectively 
in addition  the company anticipates that cash flow from operations will be insufficient to pay interest in cash on the notes when such interest becomes payable in september and on the secured notes starting in november once the amount pledged to fund the first six scheduled interest payments on the secured notes is paid and to repay the notes  the secured notes and the accrual notes in full and that such notes will need to be refinanced 
the ability of the company to effect such refinancings will be dependent upon the future performance of the company  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond the control of the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to improve its operating results or that the company will be able to meet its debt service obligations 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  and investments  including restricted investments of approximately million 
the company believes that such amounts will be sufficient to fund the company s operations through the end of fiscal divestitures and other management actions may prolong capital availability into the fiscal year and beyond 
thereafter  the company expects to require additional financing 
the extent of additional financing will depend on  among other things  the rate of the company s expansion and the success of the company s businesses 
in the event that the company s plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  the company incurs significant unexpected expenses  or the company s cash resources  together with borrowings under the current financing arrangements prove to be insufficient to fund the company s growth and operations  or if the company consummates additional acquisitions  the company may be required to seek additional sources of capital or seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
the company may also seek to raise additional capital to take advantage of favorable conditions in the capital markets 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to the company or  if available  that it can be concluded on terms acceptable to the company or within the limitations contained within the company s financing arrangements 
failure to obtain such financing could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s development or expansion plans and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
such failure could also limit the ability of the company to make principal and interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness 
the company has no material working capital or other credit facility under which it may borrow for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance that such a facility will be available to the company in the future or that if such a facility were available  that it would be available on terms and conditions acceptable to the company 
the company s net cash used in operating and investing activities was million and million for fiscal and the twelve months ended december   respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities from borrowings and equity issuances to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and operating losses was million and million for fiscal and the twelve months ended december   respectively 
capital expenditures for fiscal and the twelve months ended december  were million and million  respectively 
the company estimates capital expenditures of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the majority of these expenditures is expected to be made for the construction of network and longhaul fiber optic facilities and the purchase of switches and related equipment to facilitate the offering of the company s services 
continued significant capital expenditures are expected to be made thereafter 
in addition  the company expects to continue to incur operating losses while it expands its business and builds its customer base 
actual capital expenditures and operating losses will depend on numerous factors  including the extent of future expansion  acquisition opportunities and other factors beyond the company s control  including economic conditions  competition  regulatory developments and the availability of capital 
in addition to the company s capital expenditures  the company has also made cash expenditures for strategic acquisitions 
in march  the company acquired call america phoenix  a phoenix based reseller of long distance  for approximately million in cash and the business of whole earth networks  inc  a san francisco based isp  for approximately million in cash and the assumption of approximately million of liabilities 
in april  the company acquired icon  a switch based reseller of long distance and local service located in seattle  for approximately million in cash 
in may  the company completed the offering of million principal amount at maturity of notes 
the notes fully accrete to face value on may  from and after may   the notes bear interest  which will be payable in cash  at a rate of per annum on each may and november  commencing november  the net proceeds from the sale of the notes of approximately million are restricted for the purchase of telecommunications equipment and network infrastructure 
the indenture relating to the notes includes restrictive covenants which  among other items  limit or restrict additional indebtedness incurred by the company  investment in certain subsidiaries  the sale of assets and the payment of dividends 
the company is a party to a registration rights agreement relating to the notes whereby it has agreed to consummate an exchange offer for the notes pursuant to an effective registration statement or cause the notes to be registered under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to a shelf registration statement by november  although the company has filed a registration statement on form s with respect to an exchange offer for the notes  it has not yet been declared effective 
therefore  in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement  interest in addition to the accrual of original issue discount and interest otherwise due on the notes after such date on the notes will accrue  at an annual rate of  from november  and be payable in cash semiannually in arrears  on each may and november  commencing may  until such exchange offer is consummated or a shelf registration statement is declared effective 
the company may have committed certain technical indenture covenant violations  and the company has notified the indenture trustee in this regard

substantially all of the company s operations are conducted in the united states 
in addition  at that date  the company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately cdn 
million us million available to offset future taxable income of the parent holding company in canada 
while such loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income of the company in each respective tax jurisdiction  the company may not generate sufficient taxable income so as to utilize all or a substantial portion of such loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
further  the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against future taxable income is subject to limitation if the company experiences an ownership change as defined in section of the code and the analogous provision of the canada act 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under sfas no 
 entities are now required to carry all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value ie  gains and losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
the company must adopt sfas no 
by january  the company has not determined the impact that sfas no 
will have on its financial statements and believes that such determination will not be meaningful until closer to the date of initial adoption 
in april  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires that costs incurred during start up activities  including organization costs  be expensed as incurred and that previously capitalized costs related to such activities be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle upon adoption 
the company will adopt the provisions of sop at the beginning of and does not anticipate that this new standard will have a material impact on future results of operations 
year program the year issue is the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date ending in as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is currently verifying system readiness for the processing of date sensitive information by its information technology it systems applications  hardware  system software and interfaces and its network operations 
the review of it systems and network operations is centrally managed through a year program management office pmo 
the company s state of readiness 
in general  the company s year project is divided into three phases inventory and assessment phase one  strategy and contingency planning phase two  and conversion and remediation phase three 
the company completed its phase one assessment for it systems in october phase one for network operations is expected to be concluded by the end of first quarter the company has focused its independent testing activities principally on those systems whose failure would pose the greatest risk to the company 
the company may not independently test all of its equipment and will rely upon vendor representations  if received by the company  where tests are not conducted 
there can be no assurance of the accuracy or completeness of such representations 
the company is continuing to contact all of its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the company s interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issues 
with respect to it systems  the company completed phase two  wherein remedial actions were planned and a contingency plan was formulated  in december the company expects to complete phase three for it systems  wherein remedial actions will be implemented and tested  by third quarter the company anticipates conclusion of phase two and phase three activities for network operations by the third quarter costs 
the total amount expended on the project through december  was approximately 
million 
the total cost of the year project is estimated to be million  including 
million in internal staffing costs  million in external staffing costs and million in hardware and software upgrade costs 
this cost may be reduced if software and hardware are replaced with compliant systems as a result of other currently scheduled capital projects 
the company does not expect remediation costs to have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
there can be no assurance  however  that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of changes as the program progresses  and failure to implement such changes could have an adverse effect on future results of operations 
risks 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the year project is expected to significantly reduce the company s level of uncertainty about the year problem 
the company believes that  with the implementation of new business systems and completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year update should be read in conjunction with the company s cautionary statements as supplemented by the following statements regarding the year project in particular

historical and anticipated future operating losses and negative adjusted ebitda the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative adjusted ebitda while it expands its business and builds its customer base

management believes that adjusted ebitda provides a meaningful measure of operating cash flow without the effects of working capital changes for the continuing operations of the company by excluding the effects of noncash expenses and non operating activities 
however  adjusted ebitda should not be used as an alternative to operating loss and net loss as determined in accordance with gaap

development and expansion risk and possible inability to manage growth the company is in the early stages of its operations 
certain of its networks have only recently become commercially operational  and the company has only recently begun to deploy switches in its networks 
the success of the company will depend  among other things  upon the company s ability to smart build and assess potential markets  design fiber backbone routes that provide ready access to a substantial customer base  secure financing  obtain required rights of way  building access and governmental permits  implement expanded interconnection and collocation with facilities owned by ilecs  achieve a sufficient customer base  service customers it has targeted using its smart build approach  and upon subsequent developments in state and federal regulations 
the company has begun to target tier cities  and competition in such markets is expected to be significantly greater than in the tier and tier cities in which the company is currently operating 
there can be no assurance that any networks to be developed or further developed will be completed on schedule  at a commercially reasonable cost or within the company s specifications 
in addition  the expansion of the company s business has involved and is expected to continue to involve acquisitions  which could divert the resources and management time of the company and require integration with the company s existing operations 
there can be no assurance that any acquired business will be successfully integrated into the company s operations or that any such business will meet the company s expectations 
the company s future performance will depend  in part  upon its ability to manage its growth effectively  which will require it to continue to implement and improve its operating  financial and accounting systems  to expand  train and manage its employee base and to effectively manage the integration of acquired businesses 
these factors and others could adversely affect the expansion of the company s customer base and service offerings 
the company s inability either to expand in accordance with its plans or to manage its growth could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
significant capital requirements the company estimates that its capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company believes that the cash on hand will provide sufficient funds for the company to expand its business as presently planned and to fund its operating expenses through the end of fiscal divestitures and other management actions may prolong capital availability into fiscal and beyond 
thereafter  the company expects to require additional financing 
in the event that the company s plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  or the foregoing sources of funds prove to be insufficient to fund the company s growth and operations  or if the company consummates acquisitions  the company may be required to seek additional capital or seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
sources of financing may include public or private debt or equity financing by the company or its subsidiaries  sales of assets or other financing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that additional financing would be available to the company  or  if available  that it could be obtained on acceptable terms or within the limitations contained in the company s financing arrangements 
failure to obtain such financing could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of the company s development and expansion plans and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
such failure could also limit the ability of the company to make principal and interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness 
the company has no material working capital or other credit facility under which it may borrow for working capital and other general corporate purposes

substantial indebtedness at december   the company had outstanding on a consolidated basis approximately  million of indebtedness and million of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
in addition  the accretion of original issue discount will cause an million increase in liabilities by december  relating to the notes sold in december  a million increase in liabilities relating to the accrual notes by november  and a million increase in liabilities by may  relating to the notes 
the indentures relating to the notes the indentures  the indenture relating to the secured notes the secured notes indenture  the indenture relating to the accrual notes the accrual notes indenture and the indenture relating to the notes the indenture and together with the indentures  the secured notes indenture and the accrual notes indenture  the indentures limit  but do not prohibit  the incurrence of additional indebtedness by the company 
the company expects to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the company has entered into an agreement with siemens the siemens loan agreement that provides for up to an aggregate of million in equipment financing  of which million had been provided at december  the company also entered into an agreement the ntfc loan agreement with ntfc capital corp 
for up to million of additional equipment financing all of which had been provided at december  
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all 
the level of the company s indebtedness could have important consequences to its future prospects  including the following i limiting the ability of the company to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  ii requiring that a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations  if any  be dedicated to the payment of principal of and interest on its indebtedness and other obligations  iii limiting its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  its business  iv the company will be more highly leveraged than some of its competitors  which may place it at a competitive disadvantage  and v increasing its vulnerability in the event of a downturn in its business 
possible inability to service debt  refinancing risks in connection with the buildout of its networks and expansion of icp services  the company has been experiencing increasing negative adjusted ebitda 
the company s earnings before fixed charges were insufficient to cover fixed charges for fiscal  the three month period  fiscal and fiscal by million  million  million and million  respectively  and the company s adjusted ebitda minus capital expenditures and interest expense for fiscal  the three month period  fiscal and fiscal were negative million  negative million  negative million and negative million  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to improve its earnings before fixed charges or adjusted ebitda or that it will be able to meet its debt service obligations 
as the company does not currently have a revolving credit facility  if a shortfall occurs  alternative financing would be necessary in order for the company to meet its liquidity requirements  and there can be no assurance that such financing would be available 
in such event  the company could face substantial liquidity problems 
in addition  the company anticipates that cash flow from operations will be insufficient to pay interest in cash on both the notes when such interest becomes payable in june and on the secured notes starting in november once the amount pledged to fund the first six interest payments on the secured notes is paid and to repay the notes  the secured notes  the accrual notes and the notes at maturity and that such indebtedness will need to be refinanced 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to effect such refinancings 
the ability of the company to meet its obligations and to effect such refinancings will be dependent upon  among other things  the future performance of the company  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond the control of the company 
failure by the company to meet its obligations could result in a default on its indebtedness  including the notes  the secured notes  the accrual notes and the notes  which would permit the holders of substantially all of the company s indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof 
financial and operating restrictions imposed by existing indebtedness the company s financing arrangements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the company 
such restrictions affect  and in certain cases significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness or to create liens on its assets  sell assets  engage in mergers or acquisitions or make investments 
failure to comply with any such covenant could result in a default thereunder  which could result in an acceleration of such indebtedness 
possible inability to remedy current non compliances under the indentures the company  gst network  gst usa  and gst funding are parties to certain indentures and have issued or guaranteed notes governed by those indentures 
in november  the company notified united states trust company of new york  as trustee under the indentures  that certain actions by the company and its subsidiaries may not have been in compliance with the technical requirements of the restrictive covenants contained in the indentures 
in particular  the company disclosed that a series of transactions with global may have resulted in technical non compliances with the indentures 
see business global light telecommunications 
the company is currently conducting a review of the relevant transactions and intends to vigorously pursue any necessary action to cure the potential non compliances 
the company has already initiated litigation against global and others in an effort to cure any technical covenant violations that may have resulted from the transactions with global 
see legal proceedings 
in february  the trustee informed the note holders of the potential violations 
pursuant to the definitions contained within the indentures of each of the notes described above  no default has been declared and no event of default has occurred 
the company has not classified the related debt obligations as current in its consolidated financial statements because management believes it is probable that  in the event that the holders declared a default  the company would be able to take corrective actions to cure any objectively determinable violations within the prescribed grace period 
while the company believes that any non compliances can be cured  the company cannot offer any assurance that the litigation will be successful or that any other potential cures will be effected in a timely manner or be sufficient 
in the event that the company has violated its indentures and does not cure the violations  the holders of the notes issued under the indentures could demand repayment of the notes  discontinue disbursements of cash proceeds of the most recent notes and assert other remedies against the company 
if any of these events occurred  the company would not have sufficient liquid assets to repay the notes 
difficulties in implementing local and enhanced services the company has deployed and plans to continue to deploy high capacity digital switches in the cities in which it operates or plans to operate networks  as well as in certain cities where the company will rely on ilec facilities for transmission 
this enables the company to offer a variety of switched access services  enhanced services and local dial tone 
the company expects negative adjusted ebitda from its switched services during the to month period after a switch is deployed 
for switches operating in conjunction with the company s networks  the company expects operating margins to improve as the network is expanded and larger volumes of traffic are carried on the company s network 
for switches operating in cities where the company relies on ilec facilities for transmission  the company will experience lower or negative operating margins 
the ilecs will be required to unbundle local tariffs and permit the company to purchase only the origination and termination services it needs  thereby decreasing operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that such unbundling will be effected in a timely manner and result in prices favorable to the company 
in addition  the company s ability to successfully implement its switched and enhanced services will require the negotiation of resale agreements with ilecs and other clecs and the negotiation of interconnection agreements with ilecs  which can take considerable time  effort and expense 
in august  the fcc released its interconnection decision implementing the interconnection portions of the telecommunications act 
the interconnection decision establishes rules for negotiating interconnection agreements and guidelines for review of such agreements by state public utilities commissions 
on july   the eighth circuit vacated certain portions of the interconnection decision  including provisions establishing a pricing methodology for unbundled elements and a procedure permitting new entrants to pick and choose among various provisions of existing interconnection agreements between ilecs and their competitors 
on january   the supreme court reversed the eighth circuit 
the supreme court and the eighth circuit decisions create uncertainty about the rules governing pricing  terms and conditions of interconnection agreements  and could make negotiating and enforcing such agreements more difficult and protracted and may require renegotiation of existing agreements 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain interconnection agreements on terms acceptable to the company 
see business regulation 
the company will generally be dependent on ilecs for provision of local telephone service through access to local loops  termination service and  in some markets  central office switches of such carriers 
in addition  in certain markets the company intends to obtain the local telephone services of the ilec on a wholesale basis and resell that service to end users 
any successful effort by the ilec to deny or substantially limit the company s access to the ilec s network elements or wholesale services could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to provide local telephone services in those markets where the company relies on such network elements to provision local dial tone service 
although the telecommunications act imposes interconnection obligations on ilecs  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain access to such network elements or services at rates  and on terms and conditions  that permit the company to offer local services at rates that are both profitable and competitive 
many new carriers  including the company  have experienced certain difficulties with respect to provisioning  interconnection and the operational support systems used by new carriers to order and receive network elements and wholesale services from the ilecs 
these systems are necessary for new carriers such as the company to provide local service to customers on a timely and competitive basis 
in addition  the telecommunications act creates incentives for rbocs to permit access to their facilities by denying such carriers the ability to provide long distance services in their regions until they have met specified conditions opening the market to competition at the local level 
the rbocs in the company s markets have indicated their intent to seek authority to provide in region long distance services but are not yet permitted to do so 
there can be no assurance that the rbocs will be accommodating to the company once they are permitted to offer in region long distance service 
should the company be unable to obtain the cooperation of an ilec in a region  whether or not such ilec has been authorized to offer in region long distance service  the company s ability to offer local services in such region on a timely and cost effective basis would be adversely affected 
the company is a recent entrant into the newly created competitive local telecommunications services industry 
the local dial tone services market was opened to competition due to the passage of the telecommunications act and related state and federal regulatory rulings 
there are numerous operating complexities associated with providing these services 
the company is required to develop new products  services and systems and to develop new marketing initiatives to sell these services 
the company s switched services may not be profitable due to  among other factors  lack of customer demand  inability to secure access to facilities of ilecs at acceptable rates  competition from other clecs and pricing pressure from the ilecs 
the company has very limited experience providing switched access and local dial tone services and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully implement its switched and enhanced services strategy 
see business telecommunications services strategy 
recent commencement of integrated marketing effort the company has only recently begun an integrated marketing effort of its telecommunication service offerings 
historically  the company has marketed its access services primarily to long distance carriers and significant end users of telecommunications services  and its long distance services to small businesses and consumers 
although the company expects to market a variety of telecommunications services to all of its customers  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain new customers or retain and sell additional services to existing customers 
dependence on key customers the company s five largest telecommunications services customers accounted for approximately   and of the company s consolidated telecommunication and other services revenues for fiscal  the three month period  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
it is anticipated that during the early stages of development of individual networks  before obtaining a sufficient amount of end user revenues  the company will be dependent on a limited number of long distance carriers for a significant portion of its local revenues 
while long distance carriers have high volume requirements and have utilized clecs and icps  they generally are more price sensitive than end users 
the loss of  or decrease of business from  one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
risks relating to long distance business for fiscal  the three month period  fiscal and fiscal  long distance represented   and of the company s consolidated telecommunications services revenues  respectively 
the long distance business is extremely competitive  and prices have declined substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to decline 
in addition  the long distance industry has historically had a high average churn rate  as customers frequently change long distance providers in response to the offering of lower rates or promotional incentives by competitors 
the company has resale agreements with long distance carriers to provide it with transmission services 
such agreements typically provide for the resale of long distance services on a per minute basis with minimum volume commitments 
negotiation of these agreements involves estimates of future supply and demand for transmission capacity  as well as estimates of the calling pattern and traffic levels of the company s future customers 
in the event the company fails to meet its minimum volume commitments  it may be obligated to pay underutilization charges  and in the event it underestimates its need for transmission capacity  the company may be required to obtain capacity through more expensive means 
charges for access service for the origination and termination of long distance traffic have made up a significant portion of the company s overall cost of providing long distance service 
in may  the fcc adopted changes to its interstate access rules that among other things reduce per minute access charges and substitute new per line flat rate monthly charges 
the fcc also approved reductions in overall access rates  and established new rules to recover subsidies to support universal service and other public policies 
the impact on these changes on the company or its competitors is not yet clear 
the company could be adversely affected if it does not experience access cost reductions proportionally equivalent to those of its competitors 
insofar as internet based competitors continue to be exempt from these charges  they could enjoy a significant cost advantage in this area 
see business regulation 
pricing pressures and risks of industry over capacity the long distance industry has generally been characterized by over capacity and declining prices since shortly after the at t corp 
at t divestiture in the company believes that  in the last several years  increasing demand has ameliorated the over capacity and that pricing pressure has been reduced 
however  the company anticipates that prices for its wholesale longhaul services will continue to decline over the next several years 
while demand continues to increase  the company is aware that certain long distance carriers are expanding their capacity and believes that other long distance carriers  as well as potential new entrants to the industry  are constructing new fiber optic and other long distance transmission networks in the united states 
since the cost of the actual fiber as opposed to construction costs is a relatively small portion of the cost of building new transmission lines  persons building such lines are likely to install fiber that provides substantially more transmission capacity than will be needed over the short or medium term 
further  recent technological advances may greatly expand the capacity of existing and new fiber optic cable 
although such technological advances may enable the company to increase its capacity  an increase in the capacity of the company s competitors could adversely affect the company s business 
if industry expansion results in capacity that exceeds overall demand along any of the company s routes  severe additional pricing pressure could develop 
in addition  strategic alliances or similar transactions  such as the long distance capacity purchasing alliance among certain rbocs announced in the spring of  could result in additional pricing pressure on long distance carriers 
furthermore  the marginal cost of carrying an additional call over existing fiber optic cable is extremely low 
as a result  within a few years  there may be dramatic and substantial price reductions 
see competition 
dependence on billing  customer services and information systems sophisticated information and processing systems are vital to the company s growth and its ability to monitor costs  bill customers  provision customer orders and achieve operating efficiencies 
billing and information systems for the company s historical lines of business have been produced largely in house with partial reliance on third party vendors 
these systems have generally met the company s needs due in part to the low volume of customer billing 
as the company transitions to the provisioning of local services and as its long distance and internet operations continue to expand  the need for sophisticated billing and information systems will continue to increase 
the company s plans for the development and implementation of its billing systems rely  for the most part  on the delivery of products and services by third party vendors 
similarly  the company is developing customer call centers to provision service orders 
information systems are vital to the success of the call centers  and the information systems for these call centers are largely being developed by third party vendors 
failure of these vendors to deliver proposed products and services in a timely and effective manner and at acceptable costs  failure of the company to adequately identify all of its information and processing needs  failure of the company s related processing or information systems  or the failure of the company to upgrade systems as necessary could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the company to reach its objectives  its financial condition and its results of operations 
year issues the dates on which the company believes the year project will be completed are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the year project 
specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced  and similar uncertainties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem resulting in part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties  the company cannot ensure its ability to timely and cost effectively resolve problems associated with the year issue that may affect its operations and business  or expose it to third party liability 
see management s discussion and analysis year program 
competition the telecommunications industry is highly competitive 
in most markets  the company s principal competitor for local exchange services is the rboc or the gte companies 
other competitors may include other icps  clecs  microwave and satellite carriers  wireless telecommunications providers and private networks built by large end users 
potential competitors using similar or different technologies include cable television companies  utilities and rbocs outside their current local service areas 
in addition  the company anticipates future competition from large long distance carriers  such as at t  mci worldcom  inc mci worldcom and sprint  which have begun to offer integrated local and long distance telecommunications services 
at t also has announced its intention to offer local services using a new wireless technology 
several companies have begun to offer telecommunications services over the internet at rates substantially below current long distance rates 
companies offering telecommunications services over the internet could enjoy a significant cost advantage because at this time they do not pay carrier access charges or universal service fees 
the influx of competitors into the company s markets and into markets that the company may subsequently enter may result in more participants than can ultimately be successful in a given market 
consolidation of telecommunications companies and the formation of strategic alliances within the telecommunications industry  as well as the development of new technologies  could give rise to significant new competitors to the company 
in addition  a continuing trend toward business combinations and strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry may further enhance competition 
for example  worldcom inc acquired mfs communications company  inc 
brooks fiber properties inc and mci communications corp  each of which compete with the company in several of the markets in which the company operates 
at t has acquired teleport communications group  inc  a clec that also competes with the company in several markets 
the company cannot determine what effect such acquisitions will have on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a recent entrant in the integrated telecommunications services industry  the company may not achieve a significant market share for any of its services 
in particular  the rbocs  the gte companies and other local telephone companies have long standing relationships with their customers  have financial  technical and marketing resources substantially greater than those of the company  have the potential to subsidize competitive services with revenues from a variety of businesses and currently benefit from certain existing regulations that favor the ilecs over the company in certain respects 
while recent regulatory initiatives  which allow clecs such as the company to interconnect with ilec facilities  provide increased business opportunities for the company  such interconnection opportunities have been accompanied by increased pricing flexibility for and relaxation of regulatory oversight of the ilecs 
for example  the fcc granted ilecs additional flexibility in pricing their interstate special and switched access services on a central office specific basis 
under this pricing scheme  ilecs may establish pricing zones based on access traffic density and charge different prices for central offices in each zone 
on february   new fcc rules became effective allowing ilecs to file streamlined tariffs on days notice for rate increases and seven days notice for rate decreases 
unless the fcc acts during the notice period  such tariffs become effective at its end 
the company has begun to target tier cities and competition in such markets is expected to be significantly greater than in tier and tier cities in which the company is currently operating 
to the extent the company interconnects with and uses ilec networks to service its customers  the company will be dependent upon the technology and capabilities of the ilecs to meet certain telecommunications needs of the company s customers and to maintain its service standards 
the company will become increasingly dependent on interconnection with ilecs as switched services become a greater percentage of the company s business 
the telecommunications act imposes interconnection obligations on ilecs  but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain the interconnection it requires at rates  and on terms and conditions  that permit the company to offer switched services at rates that are simultaneously competitive and profitable 
see difficulties in implementing local and enhanced services 
in the event that the company experiences difficulties in obtaining high quality  reliable and reasonably priced service from the ilecs  the attractiveness of the company s services to its customers could be impaired 
the long distance telecommunications industry has relatively insignificant barriers to entry  numerous entities competing for the same customers and a high average churn rate  as customers frequently change long distance providers in response to the offering of lower rates or promotional incentives by competitors 
the company competes with major carriers such as at t  sprint and mci worldcom  as well as other national and regional long distance carriers and resellers  many of whom are able to provide services at costs that are lower than the company s current costs 
many of these competitors have greater financial  technological and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  as a result of the telecommunications act  the rbocs are expected to become competitors in the long distance telecommunications industry both outside of their service territory and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  within their service territory 
the company believes that the principal competitive factors affecting its long distance operations are pricing  customer service  accurate billing  clear pricing policies and  to a lesser extent  variety of services 
the ability of the company to compete effectively will depend upon its continued ability to maintain high quality  market driven services at prices generally equal to or below those charged by its competitors 
to maintain its competitive posture  the company believes that it must be in a position to reduce its prices in order to meet reductions in rates  if any  by others 
any such reductions could adversely affect the company 
the company s longhaul business is subject to intense competition 
see pricing pressures and risks of industry over capacity 
the internet services market is highly competitive 
there are no substantial barriers to entry  and the company expects that competition will continue to intensify 
the company s competitors in this market include internet service providers  other telecommunications companies  online services providers and internet software providers 
many of these competitors have greater financial  technological and marketing resources than those available to the company 
on february   us west petitioned the fcc to allow it to build and operate packet and cell switched data networks across lata boundaries  to permit it to carry interlata data traffic incident to its provision of digital subscriber line services  to not require it to make those data services available on a discounted resale basis and to not require it to make the non bottleneck elements of such services available on an unbundled basis 
on june   sbc communications  inc sbc filed a similar petition with the fcc 
the company provides certain services with which us west and sbc s proposed services would compete if the petitions were granted by the fcc 
while the fcc denied these requests  it initiated a rulemaking which  if adopted  would permit ilecs to provide advanced services through a structurally separated  and largely deregulated subsidiary 
the proposed rulemaking would not permit the rboc provision of such services across lata boundaries 
the world trade organization wto agreement on basic telecommunications services could increase the company s competition for telecommunication services both domestically and internationally 
under this agreement  the united states and other members of the wto committed themselves to opening their telecommunications markets to competition and foreign ownership and to adopting regulatory measures to protect competitors against anticompetitive behavior by dominant telephone companies  effective in some cases as early as january  government regulation the company s networks and the provision of switched and private line services are subject to significant regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
delays in receiving required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulation or regulatory requirements may have a material adverse effect upon the company 
the fcc exercises jurisdiction over the company with respect to interstate and international services 
additionally  the company files tariffs with the fcc 
state regulatory commissions exercise jurisdiction over the company to the extent it provides intrastate services 
as such a provider  the company is required to obtain regulatory authorization and or file tariffs at state agencies in most of the states in which it operates 
certificates of authority to provide services can generally be conditioned  modified  canceled  terminated or revoked for failure to comply with rules and regulations 
fines and other penalties may also be imposed 
local authorities regulate the company s access to municipal rights of way 
the networks are also subject to numerous local regulations such as building codes and licensing 
such regulations vary on a city by city and county by county basis 
see business regulation 
there can be no assurance that the fcc or state commissions will grant required authority or refrain from taking action against the company if it is found to have provided services without obtaining the necessary authorizations 
if authority is not obtained or if tariffs are not filed  or are not updated  or otherwise do not fully comply with the tariff filing rules of the fcc or state regulatory agencies  third parties or regulators could challenge these actions 
such challenges could cause the company to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses 
the telecommunications act provides for a significant deregulation of the domestic telecommunications industry  including the local exchange  long distance and cable television industries 
the telecommunications act remains subject to judicial review and additional fcc and state rulemakings  and thus it is difficult to predict what effect the legislation will have on the company and its operations 
there are currently many regulatory actions underway and being contemplated by federal and state authorities regarding interconnection pricing and other issues that could result in significant changes to the business conditions in the telecommunications industry 
there can be no assurance that these changes will not have a material adverse effect upon the company 
the fcc released a report to congress on april  concerning its implementation of the telecommunications subsidy provisions of the telecommunications act 
the fcc clarified that entities that provide transmission capacity to internet service providers are providing telecommunications services subject to contribution requirements 
the fcc indicated that it would address the issue of whether isps would contribute to a universal service fund based on the utilization of their own transmission facilities at a later date and whether certain isp services such as phone to phone ip telephony are telecommunications services subject to universal service fund contribution and access charge payments 
beginning in june  every rboc advised clec s that they did not consider calls in the same local calling area from their customers to clec customers  who are isps  to be local calls under the interconnection agreements between the rbocs and the clecs 
the rbocs claim that these calls are exchange access calls for which exchange access charges would be owed 
the rbocs claimed  however  that the fcc exempted these calls from access charges so that no compensation is owed to the clecs for transporting and terminating such calls 
as a result  the rbocs threatened to withhold and in many cases did withhold  reciprocal compensation for the transport and termination of such calls 
to date  twenty nine state commissions have ruled on this issue in the context of state commission arbitration proceedings or enforcement proceedings 
in every state  to date  the state commission has determined that reciprocal compensation is owed for such calls 
several of these cases are presently on appeal 
reviewing courts have upheld the state commissions in the four decisions rendered to date on appeal 
appeals from these decisions are pending in the fifth  seventh and ninth us circuit courts of appeal 
on february   the fcc issued a declaratory ruling on the issue of inter carrier compensation for calls bound to isps 
the fcc ruled that the calls are jurisdictionally interstate calls  not local calls 
the fcc  however  determined that this issue was not dispositive of whether inter carrier compensation is owed 
the fcc noted a number of factors which would allow the state commissions to leave their decisions requiring the payment of compensation undisturbed 
the company cannot predict the impact of the fcc s ruling on existing state decisions  or the outcome of pending appeals or of additional pending cases 
in a combined report and order and notice of proposed rulemaking released on december   the fcc made changes and proposed further changes in the interstate access charge structure 
in the report and order  the fcc removed restrictions on ilecs ability to lower access prices and relaxed the regulation of new switched access services in those markets where there are other providers of access services 
if this increased pricing flexibility is not effectively monitored by federal regulators  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to compete in providing interstate access services 
on may   the fcc released an order revising its access charge rate structure 
the new rules substantially increase the costs that ilecs subject to the fcc s price cap rules price cap lecs recover through monthly  non traffic sensitive access charges and substantially decrease the costs that price cap lecs recover through traffic sensitive access charges 
in the may th order  the fcc also announced its plan to bring interstate access rate levels more in line with cost 
the plan will include rules that grant price cap lecs increased pricing flexibility upon demonstrations of increased competition or potential competition in relevant markets 
under the communications act and other federal regulations  foreign nationals may not own more than of a company  or have more than a voting interest in a company  that directly holds a common carrier radio license 
the communications act also prohibits foreign nationals from owning or more of a company which  in turn  controls a company holding a radio license  if the fcc finds that such alien participation would not serve the public interest 
under the wto agreement  the united states agreed to permit foreign nationals to own up to of a company that directly holds a common carrier radio license 
on november   the fcc adopted rules implementing the wto policies for wto member states to acquire up to a indirect interest in a us radio license 
prior approval will still be required 
the operations of gst telecom hawaii  inc use  among other facilities  microwave radio facilities operating pursuant to fcc licenses granted to pacwest network  inc pni  an entity controlled by john warta  the company s former chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
as a result of changes in federal policies  there is no regulatory impediment to preclude pni from transferring such microwave facilities and associated licenses to the company  subject to fcc approval 
the fcc also has the authority  which it is not presently exercising  to impose restrictions on foreign ownership of communications service providers not utilizing radio frequencies  which  if exercised  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company may subsequently need to obtain radio licenses to fill in certain customers in the networks that are not practical to reach by wire 
need to adapt to technological change the telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology  with the company relying on third parties for the development of and access to new technology 
the effect of technological changes on the business of the company cannot be predicted although  historically  telecommunications companies have been required to adopt new technologies to enhance the services provided to customers  thereby requiring continuing investment in capital equipment 
the company believes its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands  which may require significant continued capital expenditures to provide enhanced services to the company s customers 
litigation risks the company is involved in various legal proceedings 
an unfavorable decision in one or more of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the company

possible inability to recover payments made to magnacom see business magnacom for a discussion of the risks relating to the company s prior payments made to magnacom 
dependence on key personnel the efforts of a small number of key management and operating personnel will largely determine the company s success and the loss of any of such persons could adversely affect the company 
the success of the company also depends in part upon its ability to hire and retain highly skilled and qualified operating  marketing  financial and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel in the telecommunications industry is intense and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to hire or retain necessary personnel 
dependence on rights of way and other third party agreements the company must obtain easements  rights of way  entry to premises  franchises and licenses from various private parties  actual and potential competitors and state and local governments in order to construct and operate its networks 
there can be no assurance that the company will obtain rights of way and franchise agreements on acceptable terms or that current or potential competitors will not obtain similar rights of way and franchise agreements that will allow them to compete against the company 
if any of the existing franchise or license agreements were terminated or not renewed and the company were forced to remove its fiber optic cables or abandon its networks in place  such termination could have a material adverse effect on the company

risks of investment in a canadian corporation the company is incorporated under the canada business corporations act 
certain of the directors and the company s professional advisors are residents of canada or otherwise reside outside of the us all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are or may be located outside of the us it may be difficult for us security holders to effect service of process within the united states upon such directors or professional advisors or to realize in the us upon judgments of us courts predicated upon civil liability of the company or such persons under us federal securities laws 
the company has been advised that there is doubt as to whether canadian courts would i enforce judgments of us courts obtained against the company or such directors or professional advisors predicated solely upon the civil liabilities provisions of us federal securities laws  or ii impose liabilities in original actions against the company or such directors and professional advisors predicated solely upon such us laws 
however  a judgment against the company predicated solely upon civil liabilities provisions of such us federal securities laws may be enforceable in canada if the us court in which such judgment was obtained has a basis for jurisdiction in that matter that would be recognized by a canadian court 
in addition  the company s status as a canadian corporation could  under certain circumstances  limit the ability of the company to hold or control radio frequency licenses in the united states

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate market risk the company has fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents  short term investments in us government debt instruments and certificates of deposit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about investments in us government debt instruments and certificates of deposit 
interest income earned on the company s investment portfolio is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the company believes that it is not exposed to significant changes in fair value because such investments are composed of us government debt instruments  certificates of deposit and commercial paper and the maturities are predominantly short term 
the fair value of each investment approximates its amortized cost  and long term securities have maturities of less than two years
