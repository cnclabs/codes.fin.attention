seasonality the company s heavy duty truck business is moderately seasonal 
seasonal effects on new truck sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base  including small and large fleets  governments  corporations and owner operators

seasonal effects in the construction equipment business are primarily driven by the weather

cyclicality the company s business  as well as the entire retail heavy duty truck industry  is dependent on a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including fuel prices  interest rate fluctuations  economic recessions and customer business cycles

year the year disclosure below constitutes a year readiness disclosure as defined in the year information and readiness disclosure act the act  which was signed into law on october  the act provides added protection from liability for certain public and private statements concerning a company s year readiness 
the year problem refers to the limitations of the programming code in certain existing software programs to recognize date sensitive information for the year and beyond 
unless modified prior to the year  such systems may not properly recognize such information and could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail to operate properly 
the efficient operation of the company s business is dependent on the proper functioning of its computer software programs  network and operating systems collectively  programs and systems 
these programs and systems are used in several key areas of the company s business  including inventory management  information management services and financial reporting  as well as in various administrative functions 
the company engaged an outside consultant to assist it in performing an inventory of its programs and systems to identify potential year compliance problems  as well as manual processes  external interfaces with suppliers  customers and vendors  and services supplied by vendors to coordinate year compliance and conversion 
this inventory was completed during the first quarter of and evaluated the programs and systems  the company s other devices which have imbedded computer processors or microchips and telecommunication  hvac and security systems 
based on the company s programs and systems inventory and information supplied by the company s vendors and suppliers  the company expects to attain year compliance in a timely fashion and in advance of the year date change 
the primary operating systems of the company are karmak and pfw 
the company believes  based upon representations made by the vendor of pfw  that pfw is currently year compliant 
the vendor of karmak has informed the company that it expects to be year compliant by march  the company does not utilize any customized hardware  programs or applications and is relying on its vendors to ensure that its programs and systems are year compliant 
the company believes that the year problem will not pose a significant operational problem for the company 
however  because most computer systems are  by their very nature  interdependent  it is possible that non compliant third party computers may not interface properly with the company s computer systems 
the company could be adversely affected by the year problem if it or unrelated parties fail to successfully address this issue 
management of the company currently anticipates that the expenses and capital expenditures associated with its year compliance project  including costs associated with modifying the programs and systems as well as the cost of purchasing or leasing  if required  replacement hardware and software  will not have a material effect on its business  financial position or results of operations and are expenses and capital expenditures the company anticipated incurring in the ordinary course of business regardless of the year problem 
purchased hardware and software has been and will continue to be capitalized in accordance with normal accounting policy 
personnel and other costs related to this process are being expensed as incurred 
the costs of year compliance and the expected completion dates are the best estimates of company management and are believed to be reasonably accurate 
in the event the company s plan to address the year problem is not successfully or timely implemented  the company may need to devote more resources to the process and additional costs may be incurred  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
problems encountered by the company s vendors  customers and other third parties also may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in the event the company determines following the year date change that its programs and systems are not year compliant  the company will likely experience considerable delays in processing customer orders and invoices  compiling information required for financial reporting and performing various administrative functions 
in the event of such occurrence to either the company s network or its primary operating systems  karmak and pfw  the company s contingency plans call for it to obtain  either from its current or other vendors  as soon as is feasible  hardware and or software that is compliant 
until such hardware and or software can be obtained  the company will plan to use non computer systems and manual processes for its business  including information management services and financial reporting  as well as its various administrative functions 
non critical hardware or software will be replaced  consistent with the company s current policy  on an as needed basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk o loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  and other relevant market rate or price risks 
the company is exposed to some market risk through interest rates  related to its floor plan borrowing arrangements and discount rates related to finance sales 
floor plan borrowings are based on the prime rate of interest and are used to meet working capital needs 
as of december   the company had floor plan borrowings of approximately  assuming an increase in the prime rate of interest of basis points  future cash flows would be effected by  the interest rate variability on all other debt would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
the company s provides all customer financing opportunities to various finance providers 
the company receives all finance charges  in excess of a negotiated discount rate  from the finance providers within days 
the negotiated discount rate is variable  thus subject to interest rate fluctuations 
this interest rate risk is mitigated by the company s ability to pass discount rate increases to customers through higher financing rates
