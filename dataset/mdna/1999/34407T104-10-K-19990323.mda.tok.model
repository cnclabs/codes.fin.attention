outlook this outlook section and the liquidity and capital resources section below contain forward looking statements 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that could cause the company s future results to differ materially from the expectations described here include the response of the company s competitors to the company s business strategy  market acceptance of rj service to new destinations  the cost of fuel  the weather  satisfaction of regulatory requirements and general economic and industry conditions

in general  service to new markets may result in increased operating expenses that may not be immediately offset by increases in operating revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began using united s orion revenue management system for flights departing after january  and beyond 
the pros iv revenue management system  which has been in operation since may at the company  was no longer used as of that date 
orion allows the company to take advantage of state of the art origin and destination revenue maximization capabilities 
as with the previous system  revenue management analysts will continue to monitor forecasts and make adjustments for changes in demand and behavior 
the orion system is designed to optimize all of the passenger itineraries that flow over the entire united united express network 
management believes that orion will further promote maximization of passenger revenue  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
as a result of the recent addition of new rjs  the company s maintenance expense on these aircraft were not material due to manufacturers warranties and the generally lower failure rates of major components due to the newness of the aircraft 
the current average age of the company s rj fleet is approximately one year 
the company s maintenance expense for rj aircraft will increase in future periods when substantial airframe and engine repair costs are incurred

mwaa has agreed to replace the company s interim financing with the proceeds of bonds or  if obtained  pfc funds  no later than one year following the substantial completion date of the project 
if mwaa replaces the interim financing with pfc funding rather than bond financing  the company s lease cost will be significantly lower 
the company obtained financing for this obligation from two banks in february and has borrowed million through march  mwaa has agreed to reimburse principal borrowings but the company will be responsible for all interest costs 
aircraft the company has significant lease obligations for aircraft including seven additional rj leveraged leases entered into in that are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as liabilities on the company s balance sheet

inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
year readiness background the year problem refers to the potential disruptions arising from the inability of computer and embedded microprocessor systems to process or operate with data inputs involving the years beginning with and  to a lesser extent  involving the year as used by the company  year ready means that a system will function in the year without modification or adjustment  or with a one time manual adjustment 
state of readiness the company is highly reliant on information technology it systems and non it embedded technologies of third party vendors and contractors and governmental agencies  such as the crs systems  united  aircraft and parts manufacturers  the faa  the dot  and mwaa and other local airport authorities 
the company sent questionnaires to these third party vendors  contractors and government agencies 
for all mission critical and key vendors  the company has received a response and has assessed which of their systems may be affected by year issues and what the status of their remediation plans are 
all mission critical and key vendors have stated that they will be year compliant by june  in cases where the company has not received assurances from non critical third parties that their systems are year ready  it is initiating further mail or phone correspondence 
the company also has surveyed its internal it and non it systems and embedded operating systems to evaluate and prioritize those which are not year ready 
the company has completed remediation and testing of approximately of its internal it and non it systems  and expects the company s remaining it systems to be remediated and tested by april  costs the company has utilized existing resources and has not incurred any significant costs to evaluate or remediate year issues to date 
the company does not utilize older mainframe computer technology in any of its internal it systems 
in addition  most of its hardware and software were acquired within the last few years  and many functions are operated by third parties or the government 
because of this  the company believes that the cost to modify its own non year ready systems or applications will not have a material effect on its financial position or the results of its operations 
risks the company s year compliance efforts are heavily dependent on year compliance by governmental agencies  united  crs vendors and other critical vendors and suppliers 
the failure of any one of these mission critical functions which the company believes to be the most likely worst case scenario  such as a shut down of the air traffic control system  could result in the reduction or suspension of the company s operations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of its operations 
the failure of other systems could cause disruptions in the company s flight operations  service delivery and or cash flow 
until it has fully completed its evaluation of all internal it and non it systems  the company cannot accurately estimate all risks of its year issue 
the company may identify internal systems that present a risk of year related disruption 
any such disruption could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition and results of operations 
contingency plans the company is in the process of developing year contingency plans 
the company intends to closely monitor the year compliance efforts of the third parties upon which it is heavily reliant and its own internal remediation efforts 
while certain of the company s systems could be handled manually  under certain scenarios the company may not be able to operate in the absence of certain systems  in which cases the company would need to reduce or suspend operations until such systems were restored to operational status 
any such reduction or suspension could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition and results of operations

in january  the company recorded a charge for the remaining unamortized balance of approximately million associated with preoperating costs 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and all hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at their fair values 
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on its designation and effectiveness 
for derivatives that qualify as effective hedges  the change in fair value will have no impact on earnings until the hedged item affects earnings 
for derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments  or for the ineffective portion of a hedging instrument  the change in fair value will affect current period earnings 
the company will adopt statement no 
during its first quarter of fiscal and is currently assessing the impact this statement will have on interest rate swaps and any future hedging contracts that may be entered into by the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risk results from changes in jet fuel pricing and in interest rates 
for  the company has hedged its exposure to jet fuel price fluctuations by entering into jet fuel option contracts for approximately of its estimated fuel requirements 
the option contracts are designed to provide protection against sharp increases in the price of jet fuel 
based on the company s projected fuel consumption of million gallons  a one cent increase in the average annual price per gallon of jet fuel would increase the company s annual aircraft fuel expense by approximately the company s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to the company s commitment to acquire regional jets 
the company has entered into put and call contracts designed to limit the company s exposure to interest rate changes until permanent financing is secured upon delivery of the aircraft 
at december  the company had four swap contracts outstanding related to the delivery of the next four rjs 
a one percentage point decrease in interest rates from the company s call contracts would increase the company s annual aircraft lease or ownership costs associated with these contracts by  as of march   the company has commitments to purchase additional rj aircraft 
the company expects to finance this commitment using a combination of debt  leveraged leases and single entity operating leases 
changes in interest rates will impact the actual cost to the company for these transactions in the future 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on its long term debt as the interest rates on such debt are fixed 
likewise  the company does not hold long term interest sensitive assets and therefore is not exposed to interest rate fluctuations for its assets 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
