compared with total revenues for loral s operating segments were billion for versus billion in  before intercompany and affiliate eliminations of million in and million in the increase in revenues was due primarily to growth in fixed satellite services as a result of including satmex for the full year  loral orion s leasing business for nine months  loral skynet s results for a full year in versus nine and a half months in and increased utilization of loral skynet s telstar satellites 
the growth in fixed satellite services was partially offset by a modest decline in satellite manufacturing revenues which primarily resulted from the debooking of three satellites for asian customers at the end of the increase in affiliate eliminations in reflects the elimination of a full year of satmex sales 
the increase in intercompany eliminations in  primarily reflects increased investment in satellite construction by ss l for loral s fss segment 
ebitda for operating segments before development and start up costs  and intercompany and affiliate eliminations  increased in to million from million in  a year over year increase of

these increases were partially offset by including the results of loral orion s data services business in and increased corporate expenses  which resulted primarily from costs incurred for the additional resources required to manage the substantial growth in loral s businesses  along with increased legal and other costs in support of the company s operations 
total development and start up costs rose substantially in to million  a increase over spending of million 
while the investment required for cyberstar remained constant year over year at approximately million  costs related to the further development of globalstar rose to million in from million in  due to increased activities in anticipation of the commencement of commercial service 
affiliate eliminations decreased in primarily as a result of eliminating a full year of satmex s results for versus one and a half months in  partially offset by the elimination of increased globalstar costs in and the elimination of europe star costs in intercompany eliminations increased in primarily from increased investment in satellite construction by ss l for loral s fss segment 
as a result of the above  ebitda as reported increased to million in from million in depreciation and amortization rose to million in from million in  and excludes depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated affiliates of million and million for and  respectively  primarily for satmex 
the increase primarily results from the inclusion of loral orion s depreciation  the amortization of cost in excess of loral orion s net assets acquired and from the inclusion of loral skynet s depreciation and amortization for a full year in  which includes the depreciation of loral skynet s telstar satellite which was placed in service on july  interest and investment income increased to million in from million in this increase is principally due to including loral orion s interest income in  partially offset by lower cash balances available for investment in interest expense of million in  net of capitalized interest of million  reflects interest on borrowings under loral s credit agreement and other facilities and interest on loral orion s debt subsequent to its acquisition 
interest expense of million in  net of capitalized interest of million  reflects interest on ss l s debt assumed and interest on loral s outstanding convertible preferred equivalent obligations cpeos

in  another ss l built satellite experienced degradation in the performance of two of its ku band antennae  which ss l currently estimates could result in the loss of approximately of the applicable orbital incentives  although further warranty claims could be made 
loral s consolidated financial statements include the effect of this item 
management believes that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of loral 
ss l is a target of a grand jury investigation being conducted by the office of the us attorney for the district of columbia with respect to possible violations of export control laws that may have occurred in connection with the participation of ss l employees on a committee formed in the wake of the crash of a long march rocket in china and whose purpose was to consider whether studies of the crash made by the chinese had correctly identified the cause of the failure 
the company is not in a position to predict the direction or outcome of the investigation 
if ss l were to be indicted and convicted of a criminal violation of the arms export control act  it would be subject to a fine of million per violation and could be debarred from certain export privileges and  possibly  from participation in government contracts 
since many of ss l s satellites are built for foreign customers and or launched on foreign rockets  such a debarment would have a material adverse effect on ss l s business  which is important to the company 
indictment for such violations would subject ss l to discretionary debarment from further export licenses 
whether or not ss l is indicted or convicted  ss l will remain subject to the state department s general statutory authority to prohibit exports of satellites and related services if it finds a violation of the arms export control act that puts ss l s reliability in question  and it can suspend export privileges whenever it determines that grounds for debarment exist and that such suspension is reasonably necessary to protect world peace or the security or foreign policy of the united states 
as far as ss l can determine  no sensitive information or technology was conveyed to the chinese  and no secret or classified information was discussed with or reported to them 
ss l believes that its employees acted openly and in good faith and that none engaged in intentional misconduct 
accordingly  the company does not believe that ss l has committed a criminal violation of the export control laws 
the company does not expect the grand jury investigation or its outcome to result in a material adverse effect upon its business 
however  there can be no assurance as to these conclusions 
several congressional committees have held hearings on us satellite export policy toward china  alleged influence of campaign contributions including contributions made by loral s chairman and chief executive officer on the clinton administration s export policy toward china and related matters 
one of the house committees investigating these matters  chaired by representative cox  recently issued a classified report that is said to be critical of past government and industry technology transfer practices and policies 
this report is also said to contain proposals for legislative and executive action to address perceived concerns 
it is possible that adoption of some or all of such proposals could have an adverse effect upon the ability of us based satellite manufacturers  such as ss l  and possibly other us exporters  to market their products abroad in competition with foreign based manufacturers  and might adversely affect their ability to perform existing contracts 
in addition  the portions of the report that have not yet been declassified could contain negative comments about ss l s compliance with the export control laws 
on december   the office of defense trade controls odtc of the us department of state temporarily suspended the previously approved technical assistance agreement under which ss l had been preparing for the launch of the chinasat satellite 
according to odtc  the purpose of the temporary suspension is to permit that agency to review the agreement for conformity with newly enacted legislation section of the arms export control act with respect to the export of missile equipment or technology 
ss l has complied with odtc s instructions  and believes that a review of the agreement will show that its terms comply with the new law 
the odtc  however  has not yet completed its review  and the scheduled launch date for chinasat is being delayed 
if such a delay were to continue for an extended period  or if the suspension was not lifted  ss l s customer could decide to terminate the contract 
if such a termination were to occur  ss l would have to refund advances received from chinasat million as of december  and may incur penalties of up to million and believes it would incur costs of approximately million to refurbish and retrofit the satellite so that it could be sold to another customer 
there can be no assurance that ss l will be able to find such a replacement customer

the year issue is the result of computer programs which were written using two digits rather than four to signify a year ie  the year is denoted as and not 
computer programs written using only two digits may recognize the year as the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruption of operations 
the company and its operating affiliates  globalstar and satmex  have implemented a year program the year program for their internal products  system and equipment  as well as for key vendor and customer supplied products  systems and equipment 
as part of the year program  the company and its operating affiliates are assessing the year capabilities of  among other things  their satellites  ground equipment  research and development activities  manufacturing processes and facility management systems 
the year program consists of the following phases inventory of year items  assessment including prioritization  remediation including modification  upgrading and replacement  testing and auditing 
this five step program is divided into six major sections covering both information and non information technology systems business systems  technical systems  products and services  imbedded hardware firmware  vendor supplied products and customer provided products 
as of february   the company and its operating affiliates had completed approximately of the inventory phase and approximately of the assessment phase 
the company expects to complete the first four phases  through the testing phase  of the year program during the third quarter of  which is prior to any anticipated material impact on the operations of the company and its operating affiliates 
the fifth phase  the audit phase  commenced in january and is expected to continue through the third quarter of to accommodate re audits if deemed necessary 
both internal and external resources are being utilized to execute the company s plan 
the program to address year has been underway since july the incremental costs incurred through december  for this effort by the company and its operating affiliates were approximately million 
based on the efforts of the company and its operating affiliates to date  the company anticipates additional incremental expenses of approximately million will be incurred to substantially complete the effort 
based upon the accomplishments to date  no contingency plans are expected to be needed 
as risks are identified  contingency plans will be developed and implemented as necessary 
however  because of the progress achieved to date and the company s expectations that its year program will be substantially complete in the third quarter of calendar  the company believes adequate time will be available to insure alternatives can be developed  assessed and implemented prior to a year issue having a material negative impact on the operations of the company 
however  there can be no assurance that such modifications and conversions  if required  will be completed on a timely basis 
the cost of the program and the dates on which the company believes it will substantially complete year modifications are based on management s best estimates 
such estimates were derived using software surveys and programs to evaluate calendar date exposures and numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party year readiness and other factors 
because none of these estimates can be guaranteed  actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause an adjustment of costs are number of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the ability to validate supplier certification and similar uncertainties 
the company s failure to remediate a material year problem could result in an interruption or failure of certain basic business operations 
these failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
the company and its operating affiliates are also assessing the year readiness of their key third party suppliers 
information requests have been distributed to such suppliers and replies are being evaluated 
if the risk is deemed material  on site visits to suppliers will be conducted to verify the adequacy of the information received 
however  due to the general uncertainty of the year problem  including uncertainty with regard to third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have an adverse material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
there can be no assurance given that the company s year program will be successful in avoiding any interruption or failure of certain basic business operations  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
