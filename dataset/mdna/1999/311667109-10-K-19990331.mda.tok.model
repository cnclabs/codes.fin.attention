a substantial portion of the shipments reflected several individually large orders received in management believes the company operates in markets which are extremely competitive 
many of our customers and markets operate at less than full capacity and certain markets  in particular  the far east  remain especially competitive and are subject to local economic events 
the company received million in orders including approximately million by the newly acquired shaw operations during compared to million during the same period of the company s products are primarily supplied to manufacturers and represent capital commitments for new plants  expansion or modernization 
in the case of major equipment orders  up to months are required to complete the manufacturing process 
accordingly  revenues reported in the statement of operations might represent orders received in the current or previous period 
gross margin in and was million and million  respectively

the results included several large new machine shipments with relatively lower gross margins

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in and were million and million  respectively 
a substantial portion of the shipments reflects orders received in when the dollar value of the company s order intake was higher than that experienced in prior years 
management considers the markets served by the company s products to be extremely competitive and  to some extent  affected by the uncertainty in eastern europe and the middle east 
additionally  far eastern markets are particularly competitive and volatile 
certain southeast asian countries are experiencing currency instability which contributes to uncertainty in the region 
many rubber manufacturers operate at less than full capacity 
management anticipates that the markets served by the company s products will remain extremely competitive and that those markets characterized by economic and political uncertainty will likely continue to be affected by such conditions 
the company received approximately million in orders during compared to million in when the company received several individually large orders 
in the case of major equipment orders  up to months are required to complete the manufacturing process 
accordingly  revenues reported in the statement of operations may represent orders received in the current or previous fiscal periods 
in addition  the cyclical nature of industry demand and  therefore  order intake  may affect the company s results of operations 
the company s ability to maintain and increase net sales depends upon a strengthening and stability in the company s traditional markets

this decline is largely due to the mix of products sold in the two periods and to continued stiff competition 
the shipments also include a higher relative proportion of new machine sales than in which generate lower margins than the company s more profitable spare parts  rebuild and repair business 
the margin also reflects the impact of a million increase in commissions on shipments to markets in the world where the company must use outside representatives in addition to its sales force to conduct business 
operating expenses were reduced million to million in compared to the decline in administrative costs is largely due to reduced investment banking fees 
the increase in selling expenses of million to million in as compared to is largely attributed to increased marketing programs including costs to attend the premier plastic industry convention in the united states  which occurs every three years 
research and development expenses declined primarily as a result of reduced headcount 
lastly  the reduction in operating costs is also due to continuing efforts to strictly control expenses 
during the company completed the consolidation of the assembly  repair and spare parts operations  conducted in its derby  connecticut facility into available space in its ansonia facility  to reduce operating costs and enhance efficiencies 
the cost of this project was approximately million  which included capitalized costs of approximately million for improvements to facilities and equipment 
while the company expects cost savings to result from this consolidation  the size of such savings cannot be predicted with any certainty 
other income  net of other expense  includes approximately million from the disposal of machinery and equipment the company will no longer use which results from consolidating its two connecticut facilities into one single facility

in addition  the company has been named an additional insured on a million environmental policy obtained by the purchaser and the purchaser is obligated to name the company an additional insured on any and all other environmental insurance policies obtained by the purchaser related to the derby property

this forward looking statement could  however  be influenced by the results of any further investigation which the dep might require  by dep s conclusions and requirements based upon its review of complete information when such is available  unanticipated discoveries  the possibility that new or different environmental laws might be adopted and the possibility that further regulatory review or litigation might become necessary or appropriate 
orders and backlog orders received by the company during increased million  or roughly  to approximately million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in orders includes million in orders from the newly acquired shaw operations 
in the case of major equipment orders  up to twelve months are required to complete the manufacturing process 
accordingly  revenues reported in the statement of operations may represent orders received in the current or previous periods during which economic conditions in various geographic markets of the world impact our level of order intake 
further  the cyclical nature of industry demand and  therefore  the timing of order intake may effect the company s quarterly results in the current and future fiscal quarters 
the company s ability to maintain and increase net sales depends upon a strengthening and stability in the company s traditional markets

page of the project team is made up of internal resources from various disciplines  including operations  facility management  product engineering  management information systems and finance 
the major objectives for each component are to identify and document year issues which affect the company  inventory systems  machines and processes affected by the year  assess year readiness for identified items  and design and implement a plan to achieve year readiness for significant year issues 
the identification and inventory of systems  machine and processes has been completed 
the assessment and plan to achieve year readiness are at various stages of completion for each of the three major components 
the business applications component of the company s year plan relates primarily to the company s principal internal information system which consists of a mainframe operated with third party purchased computer software 
the conversion to a year compliant version of the software was completed during the fourth quarter of  however  system testing will continue into the first half of this included the replacement of hardware and software for one of our uk operations to provide consistency with the us operation

the product applications component of the company s year plan relates primarily to microprocessors within the control equipment sold by the company 
the company has identified auxiliary equipment and components which were supplied with its products and which might pose a risk that the company s product will not function properly in the year the process is substantially complete 
some supplied components may require modification or upgrade 
the extent of modifications required are dependent on the use and extent of integration of our equipment at a customer s location

the equipment used in our manufacturing and other operations are not integrated systems  but consist principally of individual stand alone machine tools and equipment 
failure of one piece of equipment would not materially impact operations 
correspondence with the equipment suppliers to determine year readiness is in process and expected to be complete before the end of june individual pieces of equipment have been identified for replacement 
the cost of such equipment identified to date for replacement is not significant
