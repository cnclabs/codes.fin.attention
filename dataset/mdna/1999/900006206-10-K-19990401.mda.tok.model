since october  the company s capital requirements have been met in part by maytag 
in accordance with the maytag alliance  the company has been paid an aggregate of million  per month from october through march   from april through july   from august through january and  through march for technology transfer initiatives by the company

accordingly  future revenues from the maytag alliance will depend upon the establishment of additional fee based research and development projects with maytag and royalties from the successful commercialization and sales of the products that embody the company s technologies 
however  if additional projects are not initiated with maytag there is no assurance that the company would be able to find alternate sources of funding on acceptable terms for further research and development of current and future products 
this could have a significant adverse impact on the company s current and future operations 
however  management is confident that through sales of its commercial cooking system and its current credit facilities  it will have adequate funding for further research and development throughout the maytag alliance called for the mutual exchange of each company s stock with a value of approximately million 
maytag purchased  shares of the company s common stock  and the company purchased  shares of maytag common stock 
according to the terms of the strategic alliance agreement  the maytag stock owned by the company is subject to a general restriction placed on selling  pledging  transferring or assigning such securities for a period of two years from the date of the agreement

this agreement  which was never utilized  was secured by  shares of maytag common stock owned by the company 
the company could have borrowed up to the lesser of million or of the market value of the maytag stock at market rates of interest 
in january  the company terminated the revolving credit agreement with its bank and entered into an agreement with banque aig  london branch an affiliate of american international group  inc aig 
the aig facility provides for the company to pledge its maytag shares in the form of a variable stock transaction and to receive cash advances against the value of the maytag shares 
all advances mature within three years and bear interest at libor plus 
at the end of the three year term  the company may satisfy any outstanding obligation by surrendering maytag shares equal to the fair value of the obligation or with cash 
the transaction allows the company to benefit from the appreciation over per share in the maytag share price over the three year period and provides down side protection to the company in the form of a put option for the  shares of maytag stock 
the put option establishes a minimum realizable value for the maytag shares of approximately per share

at december   the company had working capital of  as compared to working capital of  at december  the  working capital increase from december  resulted primarily from the company s reclassification of the company s investment in maytag common stock to a current asset  in accordance with the maytag alliance and the associated appreciation of that investment 
for the year ended december   accounts receivable turnover was compared to during the year ended december  the decrease in accounts receivable turnover principally relates to uncollected amounts from the company s former european joint venture

cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was  and primarily resulted from net sales of marketable securities of  equipment purchases of  and investments in turbochef europe of  cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   which represents the net proceeds from exercises of stock options and warrants 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  at december  year issues turbochef technologies  like other businesses  is facing the year issue 
the year issue arises from the past practice of utilizing two digits as opposed to four to represent the year in some computer programs and software 
if uncorrected  this could result in computational errors as dates are compared across the century boundary 
since the software used in the company s patented cooking system does not utilize an internal calendar  the company believes that  for the most part  it will be unaffected by year issues 
through march   the company has had the majority of its internal software and hardware tested and made year compliant  where necessary 
the company currently plans to have all of its hardware  software and embedded systems contained in the company s equipment tested by june  and  if necessary  made year compliant no later than september  while year costs incurred to date have not been material  the company believes it will continue to incur costs related to year readiness throughout furthermore  the company believes that future costs associated with achieving year readiness will not be material  however  there is no guarantee that the company s operations will not be materially impacted by these costs 
the failure of the company s third party vendors to be year ready could prevent or delay the manufacturing or shipping products  providing customer support and completing transactions  all of which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company is currently working on plans to assess the year readiness of its major third party vendors as well as developing contingency plans as it relates to its operations and major third party vendors
