item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating results marketing services segment year ended september  revenues from the marketing services segment decreased to  for the year ended september  from  last year 
this decrease was due to approximately  in various projects which were completed and not replaced with similar work during the fiscal year  and another  was lost due to project scope reduction and schedule slippage 
this business is expected to be replaced with a full service vehicle launch and a large scale ride and drive in similar revenue amounts in addition to new electronic commerce web site development and management during the fiscal year ending september  cost of revenue as a percentage of sales decreased approximately two percentage points from last year 
the jobs mentioned in the revenue paragraph above had a higher cost of revenue proportion than our other revenues  and accounted for the decrease 
income from operations from the marketing services segment decreased from  to  in the current year 
our operating expenses decreased slightly in the rate of decrease in operating expenses was less than the rate of decrease in revenues 
while there was a decrease in operating expenses  this decrease was not sufficient to offset the unexpected decline in revenues 
although sales decreased and personnel reductions were made  management has chosen to maintain a core skilled staff as we anticipate future sales growth opportunities 
other factors which negatively impacted operating expenses are depreciation expense which rose  primarily due to a full year s depreciation of a call center building and related equipment  purchased in fiscal year  and its contents 
 of goodwill in psg was written off because it was considered to be impaired see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
year ended september  revenues from the marketing services segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  in this increase was due in large part to the pilot phase of a ride and drive program for an automotive manufacturer 
vsi drew from the full range of its in house capabilities to create  produce and field the program within a day timeframe 
vsi also completed the launch of a new truck product for an automotive manufacturer and was immediately awarded the assignment to launch two new model year trucks 
income from operations from the marketing services segment increased for fiscal  to  up from  the year before 
the increase is attributable to an increase in sales and the efficient utilization of overhead 
year ended september  revenues from the marketing services segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  in the increase is attributed to the addition of new assignments from major automotive manufactures 
assignments included new automotive vehicle introductions referred to as a launch to dealership personnel  and a sizable consulting project to occur at automotive dealerships nationwide 
the consulting project is designed to assist dealers in the development and maintenance of more effective business practices 
the launch experience stimulated interest in our ability to serve as a turnkey provider of the many marketing services we provide 
in addition  the launch served to underscore the emerging role that events like are likely to play in future automotive manufacturers marketing campaigns 
income from operations from the marketing services segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  for the prior year 
this increase is attributable to three factors opportunities such as new vehicle launches to more extensively utilize a broader range of our competencies  we also benefited from labor efficiencies that resulted from experience within the education and training segment of the business  and controlled personnel costs 
entertainment sector year ended september  revenues from the entertainment segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  for the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to new animation work received from universal studios florida men in black exhibit and for the et adventure attraction coming to universal studios japan 
the entertainment segment s sales represent necessary but discretionary spending on the part of its customers and their customers 
because of this  projects are sometimes delayed  conversely several different projects can be awarded in a short period of time 
the revenue and earnings of the entertainment segment are highly variable  and will probably continue to be so 
income from operations from the entertainment segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  for the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to efficiencies achieved from utilization of existing tooling and technologies on repetitive projects 
it is difficult to anticipate trends 
year ended september  revenues from the entertainment segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  for the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to new animation work received from universal studios hollywood for t d battle across time attraction and for the et adventure attraction coming to universal studios japan 
the entertainment segment s sales represent necessary but discretionary spending on the part of its customers and their customers

income from operations from the entertainment segment increased to  for the year ended september  from  for the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to efficiencies achieved from utilization of existing tooling and technologies on repetitive projects 
year ended september  revenues from the entertainment segment decreased to  for the year ended september  from  in the prior year 
the decline is primarily due to delays in installation schedules resulting from the lack of client site readiness and availability for the chung ho project to deliver in asia  and the delay in a contract award and the subsequent build and installation schedules of the universal studios california project 
income from the entertainment segment from operations decreased to  for the year ended september  from  in the decrease is attributed to the above mentioned delays 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
our two market segments have contrasting operating capital needs 
the marketing services segment requires considerable operating capital to support its accounts receivable and maintain its marketing infrastructure  while billing is periodic with little risk of non payment  client payment is typically slow 
it also experiences a relatively steady cash flow  there is historically slightly increased need for working capital in the late summer and early autumn as new vehicle communications services are provided 
this results in greater bank borrowings during that time of year  the lines of credit are designed to meet any such need we may have 
the entertainment segment requires relatively little capital for operating purposes  because its clients typically pay sizable deposits before projects begin  and make progress payments during project fabrication 
sales represent discretionary spending on the part of its customers and their customers 
because of this  projects are sometimes delayed  conversely several different projects can be awarded in a short period of time 
the revenue and earnings of the entertainment segment are highly variable  and will probably continue to be so 
generally  all obligations are met out of cash flow generated from operations and bank lines of credit 
based on current business conditions  we expect to meet our current obligations with cash flow generated from operations and available borrowings from our bank lines of credit 
in the marketing services segment  we expect continued growth in the areas of education and training  interactive technology  electronic commerce and space based marketing marketing efforts that occur at various places convenient to the targeted audiences 
we presently expect operating income from the marketing services and entertainment segments to increase in fiscal year however  there can be no assurance that such growth will be achieved 
our future operating results will depend in part on management s ability to manage any future growth and control expenses 
a further unexpected decline in revenues  without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing and other expenses  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we anticipate next year s revenues to approximate revenues of in the non automotive arena  we are the marketing services agency of record for the oz entertainment company oec for the wonderful world of oz theme park and resort 
this new family entertainment complex is slated to open in kansas in the launch effort draws from a full range of our competencies  including website design and administration  education and training  site based marketing  public relations and advertising support and relationship marketing 
our preliminary estimates range between million to million over a three year period  with most of the launch spending in traditional media at a lower than normal gross margin concentrated in the period immediately surrounding park opening 
investing activities 
capital expenditures for were substantially less than this is primarily attributed to a purchase of a building and furnishing the building with equipment during  as well as other large equipment purchases made in we have pursued a course of growth that resulted in investments in technology and developments aligned with the demands and opportunities of a changing marketplace for our core segments 
in this process our focus has moved toward internet and information related product services  consultative client relationships versus project oriented offerings  and start up companies and in incubator internet related initiatives

at december   the  shares had a fair market value of  during  we invested million in kc investors  lp as a limited partner  bringing our total investment to million 
this partnership was formed as an investment partnership to fund the continuing development of the oz entertainment company oec  a corporation in which the partnership holds a majority interest 
oec will develop the wonderful world of oz theme park 
we recognized a  loss under the equity method during the year related to this investment 
we expect to see continued losses until the opening of the park  currently scheduled for subsequent to year end  we converted  of accounts receivable to an equity investment in oec 
the park is planned to be constructed on  acres of land owned by the federal government 
it is necessary to receive title to the land before construction can begin 
it is anticipated that title will be received during the next year 
the success of the park as an investment is dependent upon receiving title to the land  as well as certain infrastructure improvements being completed by or paid by governmental agencies  financing arranged through governmental agencies  as well as additional public or private financing 
if the park does not open  the entire investment is at risk 
the projections provided and prepared by the management of kc investors  lp and oec forecast that the park will be profitable upon opening 
see item for a discussion of related party investments in kc investors  lp and in oec 
during fiscal year  we invested million in convertible preferred stock in a private placement offering of ecollege

see the discussion in item regarding related party notes receivable and payable and advances  and declared distributions to stockholders 
financing activities 
at september   we had lines of credit totalling  interest on these lines were at london inter bank offered rate libor plus  at september  the interest rate was and the outstanding balances were  these lines of credit mature at various dates starting in february  march  and november these lines of credit have covenants restricting us from borrowing elsewhere  loaning or guaranteeing a loan of another company without the prior written consent of the bank  transferring assets except in the ordinary course of business  and declaring dividends 
other covenants mandate certain levels of net worth and working capital  and that the ratio of total liabilities to net worth  debt service ratio and current ratio do not exceed certain amounts 
we have had a long term relationship with the bank 
through the years  it has provided financing and lines of credit for us 
there can  however  be no assurances that the lines of credit will be renewed when they mature 
if we are unable to renew these lines of credit  other sources of financing would be sought  primarily a line of credit from another banking institution 
since we are a net borrower of funds  minimal cash balances are kept on hand 
at any point in time  we may have more money in checks outstanding than the cash balance 
when checks are presented for payment  the bank notifies us  and we borrow on our lines of credit to cover the checks 
vsi acquired a building in december in october  we closed on a three year term loan for  and a seven year balloon mortgage for  these loans had interest rates of and respectively 
shortly before the end of fiscal year  vispac  inc acquired a warehouse financed by a year balloon mortgage of million 
in addition another vispac warehouse was refinanced for  at per annum 
a balloon payment equal to the unpaid balance is due in june no other long term debt financing for facilities  or any accelerated payment of existing long term debt  is expected in fiscal year on a long term basis  increased financing may be necessary to fund any large project awarded to us  or any acquisitions we may make 
while there are no current plans to conduct an offering of stock  in the long term  that cannot be ruled out 
during fiscal year  we aquired  of treasury stock 
we also retired  shares of treasury stock previously purchased for capital activities 
employees exercised stock options for   and  shares in fiscal year  and respectively 
we granted stock options at a weighted average price of  and for   and  in fiscal year  and respectively 
the options are exercisable two and three years from the date of grant in two equal parts  and expire five years after the date of grant 
in december  we implemented a restricted stock plan for  shares 
during  the number of shares authorized for the plan was increased to  awards of  shares and  shares were granted under the restricted stock plan during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the shares vest one  two and three years from the date of grant in three equal parts  in december and  we issued  and  shares respectively 
we do not expect the exercise of stock options  or purchase of shares  by employees and directors to be a material source of capital in fiscal year we believe that cash flows from operations along with bank borrowings will be sufficient to finance our activities in we have no current plans to conduct an offering of our shares to the public in fiscal year we issued  shares of stock in connection with the purchase of the performance systems group in february these shares were subject to a put option whereby the holder of the shares could sell the shares back to us at a fixed price per share of or a total of  this option was exercised in see item for further information on the purchase of performance systems group 
year yk most computer systems were originally designed to utilize a two character field or string of data to reference any given year in the th century 
if not corrected  many computer systems could fail or produce erroneous results 
on january  computer systems may confuse meant to be as a product defined as being year compliant will not produce errors in date data related to the year change from december  to january  state of readiness our plans for preparing and testing our computer systems for compliance have been approved by management  and the project has been funded in the normal course of operations 
we have completed remediation of the year issue for all information systems 
we have identified distinct areas for compliance efforts which involves all areas of our business critical business computer systems these include computer systems and applications relating to operations such as financial reporting  human resources  sales  purchasing and new business development 
suppliers we have taken steps to determine the status of the compliance plans of our significant vendors 
for instance  surveys have been sent to all significant vendors with whom we interact  requesting that they report their respective level of compliance 
we currently are monitoring the progress of those business critical vendors who are still working towards achieving compliance 
we have compiled detailed information regarding all of our significant business partners 
where appropriate we have reviewed such significant partners throughout to confirm their level of preparedness for the year and have made adjustments where necessary to avoid utilization of those partners who present an unacceptable level of risk 
other than utilities  we are not dependent on any single source for any products or services 
in the event that a significant supplier  bank or other business partner or vendor is unable to provide products or services to us due to a year failure  we believe we have adequate alternate sources for such products or services 
there can be no guarantee that similar or identical products or services would be available on the same terms and conditions or that we would not experience some adverse effects as a result of switching to such alternate sources 
end user computing we have verified compliance of desktop and laptop computers used throughout the company and replaced or repaired all non compliant computers and related software 
application development we have addressed compliance regarding all applications development for internal and external clients by modifying or replacing existing applications 
technical infrastructure our testing facility has tested system infrastructures  internal phone systems  local area networks  electronic data center  e mail systems and web hosting 
components are tested in the lab following compliance certification with suppliers 
this should be the last step in year verification 
yk costs we estimate that we have spent about  during the fiscal year for our compliance efforts 
this estimate excludes the time spent by management and administrative staff in guiding and assisting the information technology effort described above 
all related costs were funded through operating cash flows 
yk risks the most reasonably likely worst case scenario for us with respect to the problem is the failure of a third party such as energy  computer and component hardware  as well as other potential product or service suppliers failing to provide products and or services 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the problem  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the readiness of third party suppliers and customers  we are unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on our result of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the project is expected to reduce the level of uncertainty about the problem  and in particular  about the compliance and readiness of its material third parties 
we believe  but can not assure that with the completion of the project as scheduled  the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations should be reduced 
readers are cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year update should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 
yk contingency plan we have made backup arrangements  where reasonably possible  to alleviate the impact of potential failures 
outlook the u 
s economy s continued control of inflationary factors and modest interest rates  added to low unemployment  argues for a relatively stable market 
truck sales continue to fuel the auto industry s growth  with most automotive industry analysts predicting approximately  to  new automobile and truck sales in the united states in this market has been relatively consistent over the past few years 
approximately of our revenues are directly associated with the automotive industry 
based on most forecasters  the industry is running strong and not losing momentum 
in the marketing services segment  we continue to align ourselves with people  products and processes that recognize and take advantage of how the world goes about conducting business and accessing information 
our close ties to the auto industry helps us anticipate client needs in alternatives represented by technology driven communication and customer contact activities  which are providing annual growth in these diversified marketing services 
the emergence and critical importance of electronic commerce to the auto industry is changing how clients handle transactions both with consumers and suppliers 
our backpac operation was designed in anticipation of this need 
manufacturers want turnkey solution providers such as vsi to help identify their customer base  create and execute strategic tactical marketing  distribute and fulfill and ultimately evaluate results to justify the expenditure 
as manufacturers continue to outsource  we have an opportunity for growth by providing additional services to these manufacturers  advertisers  and other marketers 
the growth in marketing services and the accelerated integration of technology  particularly internet related  is a positive for us 
revenue and earnings are expected to grow for the year ending september  the projected growth is attributable to manufacturer outsourcing of customer driven solutions  especially as they impact education entertainment and technology related world wide web offerings 
our entertainment segment is benefiting from worldwide expansion and growth in theme parks  specifically  projects for the oec s wonderful world of oz  together with edutainment touring exhibits and experiences

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our revolving credit agreements  which bear interest at a floating rate 
we do not use derivative or other financial instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk or for trading purposes 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of basis points in short term market interest rates 
if short term market interest rates average basis points more in the next months  the adverse impact on our results of operations would be approximately  net of income tax benefit 
we do not anticipate any material near term future earnings or cash flow expenses from changes in interest rates related to our long term debt obligations as all of our long term debt obligations have fixed rates 
foreign currency risk 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  principally canada and australia  foreign currency translation gains and losses are not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
investment risk 
we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies in the internet information technology and entertainment areas for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in long term assets  and are accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
for these non quoted investments  our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values 
we identify and record impairment losses on these investments when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are permanently impaired 
to date  no such impairment has been recorded 
we are also exposed to equity price risk on our investments in publicly traded companies 
our available for sale securities at september  include only our equity positions in navidec  inc  which has experienced significant volatility in its stock pricesince going public in based on the december  initial public offering of ecollege 
com  our equity price risk on investments increased 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity price would result in an approximate  decrease in fair value in our available for sale securities  based upon december  closing market prices for navidec and ecollege
