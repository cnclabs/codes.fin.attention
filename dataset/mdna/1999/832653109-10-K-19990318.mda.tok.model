item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general from to the company expanded its operating revenue by  to million in from million in this revenue growth was accompanied by a increase in net earnings  to million in from million in a significant portion of the company s growth since has occurred through acquisitions 
since january   the company has acquired companies that generated aggregate annual revenue of approximately million 
these acquisitions included the purchases of east west  tp  and jht between february and october of those three carriers generated aggregate annual revenue of approximately million in the company invested approximately million in the three acquisitions in the acquisitions and other investments in revenue equipment raised the company s ratio of debt to capitalization  representing the ratio of i long term debt  including current maturities  to ii long term debt  including current maturities  and stockholders equity  to at december  although management expects acquisitions of both flatbed and dry van carriers to continue to be an important aspect of the company s growth strategy  management expects to concentrate its efforts during on integrating the operations of the companies acquired during management will continue to evaluate acquisition candidates using a number of factors  including the impact of any potential transaction on the company s debt to capitalization ratio 
the company significantly increased its dry van operations with the acquisition of east west and jht 
the company s increasing revenue from dry van operations has affected its operating statistics 
company wide revenue per loaded mile has decreased from in to in  primarily because revenue per loaded mile for the company s dry van freight is lower than for its flatbed freight 
management believes  however  that the dry van freight is comparable in profitability to flatbed freight because it typically generates fewer empty miles and greater miles per tractor than flatbed freight 
management expects that the percentage of the company s revenue generated by dry van freight will increase in because of the acquisition of jht in october fluctuations in revenue per loaded mile and other operating statistics may occur from time to time as the company s freight mix changes due to acquisitions and other factors 
the company operates a tractor trailer fleet comprised of both company owned vehicles and vehicles obtained under leases from independent contractors and third party finance companies 
fluctuations among expense categories may occur as a result of changes in the relative percentage of the fleet obtained through equipment that is owned versus equipment that is leased from independent contractors or financing sources 
costs associated with revenue equipment acquired under operating leases or through agreements with independent contractors are expensed as purchased transportation 
for these categories of equipment the company does not incur costs such as interest and depreciation as it might with owned equipment 
in addition  independent contractor tractors  driver compensation  fuel  communications  and certain other expenses are borne by the independent contractors and are not incurred by the company 
obtaining equipment from independent contractors and under operating leases reduces capital expenditures and on balance sheet leverage and effectively shifts expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses 
the fleet profile of acquired companies and the company s relative recruiting and retention success with company employed drivers and independent contractors will cause fluctuations from time to time in the percentage of the company s fleet that is owned versus obtained from independent contractors and under operating leases 
accordingly  management intends to evaluate the company s efficiency using pretax margin and net margin rather than operating ratio

results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to revenue for the periods indicated operating revenue operating expenses purchased transportation compensation and employee benefits fuel  supplies  and maintenance insurance and claims taxes and licenses general and administrative communications and utilities depreciation and amortization total operating expenses earnings from operations interest expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million in from million in the revenue increase resulted primarily from a increase in weighted average tractors  to  in from during as the company expanded internally to meet customer demand and acquired the business of east west in february  tp in august  and jht in october revenue per tractor per week excluding revenue from brokerage operations decreased per week  to  in from  in this resulted from a decrease in revenue per loaded mile  which was largely offset by an increase in miles per tractor and a decrease in empty miles percentage 
these changes were a result of the increase in van freight associated with the acquisition of east west 
in addition  revenue from the company s brokerage division increased million  to million in from million in purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation increased million  to million in from million in  as the company s business expanded and the company contracted with more independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation increased to in from in this reflects an increase in the percentage of the company s fleet supplied by independent contractors as a result of the company s internal recruiting efforts and the acquisition of east west  which has obtained a higher percentage of its fleet from independent contractors 
it also reflects an increase in the freight hauled by brokered equipment 
compensation and employee benefits increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in the increase was attributable to i an increase in the per mile wage paid to van drivers  ii an increase in the number of driver trainers and trainees  and iii an increase in the self insured retention for health insurance claims and reserve amounts for the period  which primarily related to unusual health claims during the second quarter of fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance decreased to in from in  reflecting a decrease in fuel costs to per gallon during from per gallon in the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of parts  tires  tarps  supplies  and binders used in the company s operations 
insurance and claims increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with in taxes and licenses increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained unchanged at of revenue for each year 
general and administrative expenses increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue in from in  as a result of a decrease in freight revenue being dispatched by terminal agents  resulting in less commissions paid during the period 
additionally  certain fixed costs are being spread over a larger revenue base 
communications and utilities increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities remained unchanged at in both years 
depreciation and amortization increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to of revenue in from in the increase was attributable to a larger fleet of company owned tractors and trailers  which increased the cost of the equipment being depreciated  an increase in the number of company owned tractors financed with debt rather than operating leases  slightly lower revenue per tractor  and an increase in goodwill amortization as a result of the three acquisitions in interest expense  net  increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net increased to of revenue in from in  as the company incurred debt to finance the acquisition of three trucking companies 
this increase in debt was partially offset by lower average interest rates of in compared with in as a result of the foregoing  the company s pretax margin decreased to in from in the company s effective tax rate was in of revenue  compared with in of revenue 
the effective tax rate is higher than the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by the company 
the impact of the company s paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the company s net earnings 
as a result of the factors described above  net earnings decreased to million in of revenue  from million in of revenue 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million in from million in the revenue increase resulted primarily from a increase in weighted average tractors  to in from during as the company expanded internally to meet customer demand and acquired the business of pirie motor freight  inc in february  and royal transport ltd 
in september revenue per tractor per week excluding revenue from brokerage operations increased per week  to  in from  in in addition  revenue from the company s brokerage division increased   to million in from million in purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation increased million  to million in from million in  as the company s business expanded and the company contracted with more independent contractor providers of revenue equipment 
as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in  as the increase in expenses related to brokerage revenue was more than offset by the decrease in the percentage of the company s overall fleet comprised of tractors and trailers leased from independent contractors and a decrease in the amount of fuel surcharge passed through to independent contractors and tractors utilized by the brokerage division 
compensation and employee benefits increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits increased to in from in because of the increase in the percentage of the company s revenue equipment fleet being operated by employee drivers 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased slightly to in from in  because the increase in the percentage of the company s fleet being comprised of company owned tractors  for which the company pays fuel costs  more than offset decreasing per gallon fuel prices 
insurance and claims increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims decreased to of revenue in from in  as the company reduced its insurance reserves as claims were ultimately resolved at less than the reserve amount 
taxes and licenses increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses remained relatively constant at and of revenue for and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were unchanged at of revenue for each year 
communications and utilities increased   to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities increased to in from in as a result of an increase in the number of company owned terminals  for which the company pays telephone costs  and an increase in the costs relating to usage of mobile  satellite based tracking and communication units 
depreciation and amortization increased million  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased to of revenue in from in the increase was attributable to a newer and larger fleet of company owned tractors and trailers  which increased the cost of the equipment being depreciated  and an increase in company tractors financed with debt rather than operating leases 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in revenue per tractor per week  which more efficiently spread the fixed cost of depreciation over a larger revenue base 
interest expense  net remained unchanged at million in each year 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net decreased to of revenue in from in  as the increase in average debt balance was offset by lower average interest rates of in compared with in as a result of the foregoing  the company s pretax margin improved to in from in the company s effective tax rate was in of revenue  compared with in of revenue 
the effective tax rate is higher than the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by the company

as a result of the factors described above  net earnings increased to million in of revenue  from million in of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required significant investments in new revenue equipment that the company historically has financed with borrowing under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  borrowings under lines of credit  cash flow from operations  equipment leases from third party lessors  and proceeds of the company s initial public offering 
the company also has obtained a portion of its revenue equipment fleet from independent contractors who own and operate the equipment  which reduces overall capital expenditure requirements compared with providing a fleet of entirely company owned equipment 
the company s primary sources of liquidity currently are funds provided by operations and borrowings under credit agreements with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
management believes that its sources of liquidity are adequate to meet its current anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and other needs at least through net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company s principal use of cash from operations is to service debt and internally finance accounts receivable associated with growth in the business 
customer accounts receivable increased million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
the average age of the company s accounts receivable was approximately days for  days for  and days for net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
such amounts related primarily to payments made in acquisitions of seven trucking companies and purchases  sales  and trades of revenue equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures primarily for revenue equipment and satellite communications units  net of revenue equipment trade ins  to be approximately million during such projected capital expenditures are expected to be funded with cash flow from operations  borrowings  or operating leases 
the company has begun to evaluate the need to expand its present headquarters facility and may incur a portion of the expansion costs during the size and cost of the possible expansion has not yet been determined 
the company s projected capital expenditures do not include any amount for this possible expansion 
net cash provided by used in financing activities of million  million  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted primarily of net borrowings payments of million  million  and million of principal under the company s long term debt agreements  and net borrowings payments of  million  and million under the company s former line of credit  which was paid off during at december   the company had outstanding long term debt including current maturities of approximately million  most of which was comprised of obligations for the purchase of revenue equipment 
approximately million consisted of borrowings from financial institutions and equipment manufacturers  million represented the amount drawn under the company s revolving credit facility  and million represented future payments for purchases of intangible assets 
interest rates on this debt range from to with maturities through at december   the revolving credit facility provided for borrowings of up to million  based upon certain accounts receivable and revenue equipment values 
the interest rate under the credit facility is plus the libor rate for the corresponding period 
the credit facility is secured and contains covenants that impose certain minimum financial ratios and limit additional liens  the size of certain mergers and acquisitions  dividends  and other matters 
the company was in compliance with the credit facility at december  may contain forward looking statements 
market risks the company is exposed to market risks from changes in i certain interest rates on its debt and ii certain commodity prices 
interest rate risk the revolving credit facility  provided there has been no default  carries a maximum variable interest rate of libor for the corresponding period plus 
this variable interest exposes the company to the risk that interest rates may rise 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one point increase in the libor would increase our interest expense by  commodity price risk the company uses derivative instruments  including purchased options and futures contracts to reduce a portion of its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
at december   the notional amount for purchased options and futures contracts was million gallons and net unrealized losses were approximately  at december   a ten percent change in fuel prices would impact net unrealized losses by approximately  the company also uses heating oil price swap agreements to reduce a portion of its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
at december   the company had price swap agreements for million gallons at prices ranging from cents per gallon to cents per gallon 
since the company s price is fixed for these gallons  changes in fuel prices would have no impact on the company s future fuel expense related to these gallons 
therefore  there is no earnings or liquidity risk associated with these price swap agreements 
the fair value of the price swap agreements is the estimated amount the company would pay or receive to terminate the swap agreements 
at december   a ten percent change in the price of heating oil would result in a  change in the current cost of  to terminate the swap agreements 
the company does not trade in these derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations  nor does it trade in these instruments when there are no underlying transaction related exposures 
inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and the compensation paid to drivers 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could have an adverse effect on profitability 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
seasonality in the trucking industry  results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers generally reduce shipments during the winter season  and the company experiences some seasonality due to the open  flatbed nature of the majority of its trailers 
the company at times has experienced delays in meeting its shipment schedules as a result of severe weather conditions  particularly during the winter months 
in addition  the company s operating expenses have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather

year the year issue  common to most companies  concerns the inability of information and non information systems to recognize and process date sensitive information after due to the use of only the last two digits to refer to a year 
this problem could affect both information systems software and hardware and other equipment that relies on microprocessors 
management has completed a company wide evaluation of this impact on its computer systems  applications and other date sensitive equipment 
the company s primary information technology systems it systems include hardware and software for billing dispatch  electronic data interchange  fueling  payroll and satellite communications systems 
these it systems include both company developed software and software designed by third parties 
the primary it system designed by a third party is the satellite tracking system  which tracks equipment locations  provides dispatch and routing information and allows in cab communication with drivers 
the company has been informed by this provider that its system is compliant 
another significant it system provided by a third party transmits payroll funds to drivers and allows drivers to purchase fuel and other items outside the company s terminal locations 
the company has been informed by this provider that it expects to be compliant by june the it systems developed by the company have been assessed and systems and equipment that are not year compliant have been identified and remediation efforts are in process 
management estimates that nearly percent of known remediation efforts were completed as of december  all known remediation efforts and testing of systems equipment are expected to be completed by march  the company is reviewing its risks associated with microprocessors embedded in facilities and equipment non it systems 
the primary non it systems include microprocessors in tractor engines and other components  terminal facilities  satellite communications units  and telecommunications and other office equipment 
the company s assessment of its revenue equipment  satellite communications units  and office equipment non it systems has revealed low risk of material replacement requirements 
such systems are relatively new and were designed to be year compliant 
the company is continuing to assess its non it systems included in its terminal facilities  but believes that the risk of a service interrupting failure in these systems is low 
the company is also in the process of monitoring the progress of material third parties shippers and suppliers in their efforts to become year compliant 
these third parties include  but are not limited to shippers of freight  manufacturers of operating equipment  fuel and parts suppliers  the us postal service  financial institutions  and utilities 
the company has requested copies of the year plans of the material third parties and intends to seek updates from third parties as to their performance against these plans 
through december  the company has spent approximately  to address year issues 
total costs to address year issues are currently estimated not to exceed  and consist primarily of costs for the remediation of internal systems and equipment 
funds for these costs are expected to be provided by the operating cash flows of the company 
the majority of the internal system remediation efforts relate to staff costs of on staff systems programmers  and therefore  are not incremental costs 
the company s primary risk relating to year compliance is the possibility of service disruption from third party suppliers of satellite communication  telephone  fueling  and financial services 
the company could be faced with severe consequences if year issues are not identified and resolved in a timely manner by the company and material third parties 
a worst case scenario would result in the short term inability of the company to deliver freight for its shippers 
this would result in lost revenues  however the amount would be dependent on the length and nature of the disruption  which cannot be predicted or estimated 
the progress of the company s year efforts are reported to the board of directors at each quarterly meeting 
while management expects a successful resolution of these issues  there can be no guarantee that material third parties  on which the company relies  will address all year issues on a timely basis or that their failure to successfully address all issues would not have an adverse effect on the company 
the company is in the process of developing contingency plans in case business interruptions do occur 
management expects these plans to be completed by june  cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following economic factors  fuel prices 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customer s business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
increases in fuel prices usually are not fully recovered 
accordingly  high fuel prices can have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
resale of used revenue equipment 
the company historically has recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment 
the market for used equipment has experienced greater supply than demand in through if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to decline  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at lower prices or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
competition for drivers and independent contractors is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to driver employees and independent contractors or curtail the company s growth 
competition 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  and to some extent railroads and rail intermodal service 
competition is based primarily on service  efficiency  and freight rates 
many competitors offer transportation service at lower rates than the company 
the company s results could suffer if it cannot obtain higher rates than competitors that offer a lower level of service 
acquisitions 
a significant portion of the company s growth since june has occurred through acquisitions  and acquisitions are an important component of the company s growth strategy 
management believes that the company must continue to identify desirable target companies and negotiate  finance  and close acceptable transactions and successfully integrate the acquired operations or the company s growth and profitability could suffer 
in  management intends to concentrate on integrating the operations of the three companies acquired during and may not pursue additional acquisitions as aggressively
