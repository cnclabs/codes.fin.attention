item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended march   and the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
certain statements contained herein are not based on historical fact  but are forward looking statements that are based upon numerous assumptions about future conditions that may not occur 
actual events  transactions and results may materially differ from the anticipated events  transactions  or results described in such statements 
the company s ability to consummate such transactions and achieve such events or results is subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the existence of demand for and acceptance of the company s services  economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  results of financing efforts and other factors affecting the company s business that are beyond the company s control 
the company undertakes no obligation and does not intend to update  revise or otherwise publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect future events or circumstances 
the company s results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  differences between estimated residual values and actual amounts realized related to the equipment the company leases 
operating results could also fluctuate as a result of the sale by the company of equipment in its lease portfolio prior to the expiration of the lease term to the lessee or to a third party 
such sales of leased equipment prior to the expiration of the lease term may have the effect of increasing revenues and net earnings during the period in which the sale occurs  and reducing revenues and net earnings otherwise expected in subsequent periods 
revenue recognition and lease accounting the company s principal line of business is the leasing  financing and sale of equipment 
the manner in which these lease finance transactions are characterized and reported for accounting purposes has a major impact upon the company s reported revenue  net earnings and the resulting financial measures 
lease accounting methods significant to the company s business are discussed below 
the company classifies its lease transactions  as required by the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases fasb no 
as i direct financing  ii sales type  or iii operating leases 
revenues and expenses between accounting periods for each lease term will vary depending upon the lease classification 
for financial statement purposes  the company includes revenue from all three classifications in lease revenues  and costs related to these leases in direct lease costs 
direct financing and sales type leases 
direct financing and sales type leases transfer substantially all benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
a lease is a direct financing or sales type lease if the creditworthiness of the customer and the collectibility of lease payments are reasonably certain and it meets one of the following criteria i the lease transfers ownership of the equipment to the customer by the end of the lease term  ii the lease contains a bargain purchase option  iii the lease term at inception is at least of the estimated economic life of the leased equipment  or iv the present value of the minimum lease payments is at least of the fair market value of the leased equipment at inception of the lease 
direct finance leases are recorded as investment in direct finance leases upon acceptance of the equipment by the customer 
at the inception of the lease  unearned lease income is recorded which represents the amount by which the gross lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the equipment exceeds the equipment cost 
unearned lease income is recognized  using the interest method  as lease revenue over the lease term 
sales type leases include a dealer profit or loss which is recorded by the lessor at the inception of the lease 
the dealer s profit or loss represents the difference  at the inception of the lease  between the fair value of the leased property and its cost or carrying amount 
the equipment subject to such leases may be obtained in the secondary marketplace  but most frequently is the result of releasing the company s own portfolio 
this profit or loss which is recognized at lease inception  is included in net margin on sales type leases 
for equipment sold through the company s value added re seller subsidiaries  the dealer margin is presented in equipment sales revenue and cost of equipment sales 
interest earned on the present value of the lease payments and residual value is recognized over the lease term using the interest method and is included as part of the company s lease revenue 
operating leases 
all leases that do not meet the criteria to be classified as direct financing or sales type leases are accounted for as operating leases 
rental amounts are accrued on a straight line basis over the lease term and are recognized as lease revenue 
the company s cost of the leased equipment is recorded on the balance sheet as investment in operating lease equipment and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the lease term to the company s estimate of residual value 
revenue  depreciation expense and the resulting profit for operating leases are recorded evenly over the life of the lease 
as a result of these three classifications of leases for accounting purposes  the revenues resulting from the mix of lease classifications during an accounting period will affect the profit margin percentage for such period with such profit margin percentage generally increasing as revenues from direct financing and sales type leases increase 
should a lease be financed  the interest expense declines over the term of the financing as the principal is reduced 
residual values 
residual values represent the company s estimated value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term 
the residual values for direct financing and sales type leases are recorded in investment in direct financing and sales type leases  on a net present value basis 
the residual values for operating leases are included in the leased equipment s net book value and are recorded in investment in operating lease equipment 
the estimated residual values will vary  both in amount and as a percentage of the original equipment cost  and are recorded in investment in operating lease equipment  depending upon several factors  including the equipment type  manufacturer s discount  market conditions and the term of the lease 
the company evaluates residual values on an ongoing basis and records any required changes in accordance with fasb no 
residual values are affected by equipment supply and demand and by new product announcements and price changes by manufacturers 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  residual values can only be adjusted downward 
the company seeks to realize the estimated residual value at lease termination through i renewal or extension of the original lease  ii sale of the equipment either to the lessee or the secondary market  or iii lease of the equipment to a new user 
the difference between the proceeds of a sale and the remaining estimated residual value is recorded as a gain or loss in lease revenues when title is transferred to the lessee  or  if the equipment is sold on the secondary market  in equipment sales revenues and cost of equipment sales when title is transferred to the buyer 
the proceeds from any subsequent lease are accounted for as lease revenues at the time such transaction is entered into 
initial direct costs 
initial direct costs related to the origination of sales type  direct finance or operating leases are capitalized and recorded as part of the investment in direct financing and sales type leases  net or as operating lease equipment  net and are amortized over the lease term 
sales 
sales revenue includes the following types of transactions i sales of new and or used equipment which is not subject to any type of lease  ii sales of equipment subject to an existing lease  under which the company is lessor  including any underlying financing related to the lease  and iii sales of off lease equipment to either the original lessee or to a new user 
other sources of revenue 
fee and other income results from i income events that occur after the initial sale of a financial asset such as escrow prepayment income  ii re marketing fees  iii brokerage fees earned for the placement of financing transactions and iv interest and other miscellaneous income 
these revenues are included in fee and other income on the company s statements of earnings 
results of operations revenues during the three years ended march   the company experienced growth in total revenues reflecting an increased volume of leasing and equipment sale transactions 
total revenues for fiscal year were million  as compared to and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
total revenues are comprised of equipment sales  revenue from the sales of leased equipment  lease revenues  and fee and other income 
equipment sales revenue is generated through the sale of new hardware and software products through our valued added re seller var subsidiaries and used product through the equipment brokerage and re marketing activities 
equipment sales were million in fiscal year  as compared to and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
changes in the cost of equipment sales have been consistent with changes in equipment sale revenue for the fiscal years and with margins on equipment sales of and  respectively 
in july   we purchased pc plus  inc which sells to large customers who obtain products at smaller gross margin percentages than the other var subsidiaries 
for the year ended march   margin on equipment sales was 
the sales generated by pc plus  inc represented of the total sales of equipment during the nine months of the current fiscal year 
the year ended march  margin on equipment sales was million as compared to million for the prior two years 
revenue from the sales of leased equipment increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal year leased equipment sales revenue was million in fiscal for the past two fiscal years  we have sold a significant portion of the leases originated to one institutional equity partner  mlc clc  llc 
as a result  historical increases of equipment sales revenue are a direct result of increased lease originations 
during fiscal year  sales to mlc clc  llc accounted for of leased equipment sales revenue  a component of total revenues 
while management expects the continued availability of equity financing through its joint venture partner or other sources  should such financing unexpectedly become limited or unavailable  it could have a material adverse effect upon the amount of leased equipment placed  financial condition and results of operations until other financing arrangements are secured 
cost of leased equipment sales represents the book value of equipment sold which was subject to a lease in which we are the lessor 
the revenues from leased equipment sales  as well as the related cost of sales  can vary significantly depending on the nature and timing of the sale of the equipment  as well as the nature and timing of any sale of the lease s rental stream 
for example  a lower margin  or a loss on the equity portion of a lease is often offset by lease earnings and or a gain recognized under sfas no 
additionally  leases which have been debt funded prior to equity sale will result in lower sales and cost of sales amounts  although the net earnings on the transaction will be the same as had the rental stream been sold after the equity sale 
lease revenues increased to million in fiscal  as compared to and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
these increases are directly attributable to our increased volume of lease transactions and reflects the higher investment in direct financing leases and operating lease equipment 
in addition  lease revenues reflect the gains and losses from the sale of certain financial assets  primarily lease rental streams  to outside parties on terms that qualify for treatment as a sale under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which became effective january  fee and other income reflects revenues from adjunct services and fees relating to our lease portfolio  as well as fees and other income generated by the var subsidiaries including support fees  warranty reimbursements  inventory and technical services and learning center revenues 
fee and other income accounted for  and of total revenues during the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue in fee and other income is largely attributable to the addition of pc plus  inc whose main focus is sales of product and services  fee income represented only of its revenues 
included in fee and other income are certain transactions which  while in the normal course of business  for which there can be no guarantee of future transactions of the same nature  size or profitability 
the company s ability to consummate such transactions  and the timing thereof  may depend largely on factors outside the control of management  and as such  earnings from these transactions in one period may not be indicative of earnings that can be expected in future periods 
expenses direct lease costs include expenses directly attributable to the company s lease portfolio  the largest being depreciation on the company s investment operating lease equipment and the amortization of initial direct costs 
during fiscal year  direct lease costs were million  as compared to and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the majority of leases originated in fiscal were direct financing leases 
if the company continues to originate primarily direct financing type leases in the future  depreciation on operating lease equipment will diminish as the company s operating lease portfolio matures 
professional and other costs amounted to million during fiscal year  as compared to and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase during the three year period is primarily attributable to increases in the volume of broker fees the company pays on certain lease transactions  and the increased legal and professional fees associated with the company s securities being traded in the public market since november  salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses both increased during the three years ended march  increases in these expenses are related primarily to the increased number of personnel required to service the increased volume of leasing and equipment sale transactions during the three year period 
salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses accounted for  and of total revenues during fiscal years  and  respectively 
interest and financing costs reflect interest on recourse and non recourse lease related debt  operating lines of credit  floor planning agreements in place at the var subsidiaries and other obligations 
these costs amounted to  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the company recognizes as income tax expense the amount of estimated tax due on current period s income  whether that tax is to be paid currently or in the future 
the provision for taxes was  and of earnings before income taxes and extraordinary items for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the lower provision for income taxes  as compared to earnings before tax and extraordinary items is the result of earnings from two of the company s var subsidiaries mlc network solutions  inc and ecc integrated  inc 
which  prior to their combination with the company  were sub chapter s corporations 
as such  the provision for income tax for the three fiscal years ended march  relates only to earnings of the company  exclusive of those var earnings generated prior to their business combinations 
net earnings were   and million in the fiscal years  and  respectively 
these increases are a result of the fluctuations in revenues and expenses discussed in the above paragraphs 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during the period ended march   the company improved its financial condition and available capital resources in several significant ways 
stockholders equity increased from million at the beginning of fiscal to million at march   partially the result of a private placement for million of  shares of unregistered common stock to a single investor 
second  the company continued to finance its lease transactions through an equity joint venture  mlc clc  llc 
finally  the company s available lines of credit used for short term lease financing increased from million to million  in addition to amounts available to the company s var subsidiaries through floor planning agreements 
all of these factors have allowed the company to support the higher levels of sales and leasing activity reflected in its financial statements 
the company s total assets increased to million as of march  as compared to million in total assets as of march  our cash and cash equivalents represented and of total assets as of march  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash in the current year as compared to the prior year is a result of a large volume of fundings from the sale of lease receivables which were received near the balance sheet date of the prior year 
our cash balances are invested in overnight  interest bearing investments 
the largest component of assets is our investment in direct financing and sales type leases and investment in operating lease equipment 
these assets represent and of total assets as of march  and  respectively 
the company s investment in direct financing leases and operating lease equipment amounted to and million at the end of fiscal years and  respectively  reflecting an increased lease transaction volume 
the size and composition of our lease portfolio may vary depending nature and volume of new leases originated  as well as the nature and timing of sales of lease rental streams and sale of equipment underlying the leases 
as of march  and  the company had and million in notes receivable  respectively 
the majority of these notes are receivable from our joint venture equity partner and related to the rental stream on leases attached to equipment which was sold to the equity partner 
the vast majority of these notes receivable are paid off with the proceeds of a non recourse funding secured on behalf of the joint venture to days subsequent to an equity sale 
in the event that a rental stream is not funded on behalf of the joint venture partner  we will continue to receive the rental payments from the lessee 
the company s liabilities are composed primarily of amounts due to vendors for equipment to be placed on lease  recourse lines of credit  and nonrecourse debt associated with the company s lease portfolio 
as of march  amounts due to vendors for inventory and general expenses accounts payable trade and amounts due to vendors for equipment which will be placed on lease accounts payable equipment totaled million  as compared to million at march  the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in amounts payable for equipment from our var subsidiaries due to increased sales volume 
recourse notes payable amounted to and million as of march  and respectively 
the increase represents an increased amount due under the company s lines of credits 
non recourse notes payable increased to million at march  from million as of march  the increase is the result of the debt funding of the increased lease portfolio retained on our balance sheet 
to date  the financing necessary to support our leasing and financing activities has been provided principally from non recourse and recourse borrowings from money center banks  regional banks  insurance companies  finance companies and financial intermediaries 
payments under the company s borrowings and the maturities of its long term borrowings are typically structured to match the payments due under the leases securing the borrowings 
in order to take advantage of the most favorable long term financing arrangements  the company often finances equipment purchases and the related leases on an interim basis with short term  recourse debt  and accumulates such leases until it has a sufficient transaction size either with a single lessee or a portfolio of lessees to warrant obtaining long term financing for such leases either through non recourse borrowings or a sale transaction 
such interim financing is usually obtained through the company s main operating line of credit or partial recourse warehouse lines 
borrowings under the main operating line of credit are secured by lease receivables and the underlying equipment financed under the facility 
availability under the line of credit may be limited by the asset value of equipment purchased by the company and may be further limited by certain covenants and terms and conditions of the facility 
at march   there was million outstanding under our main operating line of credit 
adequacy of capital resources the company s current working capital lines of credit  if maintained  and its expected access to the public and private debt securities markets including financings for its equity investment in leases and its estimated cash flow from operations are anticipated to provide adequate capital to fund the company s operations  including minor acquisitions and financings under its relationships with vendors  for at least the next months 
although no assurances can be given  we expect to be able to maintain  renew  or replace its existing short term lines of credit and to continue to have access to the public and private securities markets  both for debt and for equity financings 
the year issue the company has identified all significant hardware and software applications  both it and non it based  that will require upgrade or modification to ensure year compliance 
the upgrade and or modification of the majority of these systems is substantially complete 
the company plans on completing the process of modifying and or upgrading its remaining systems by september  the total cost of these year compliance activities has not been  nor is it anticipated to become  material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any given year 
the company recognizes the risks surrounding its own year readiness  for which it believes it has adequately addressed  as well as the risks arising from the failure of third parties with whom it has a material relationship to remediate their own year issues 
while the risks of third party non compliance may temporarily affect the ability of a third party to transact business with the company  the company believes such risks are adequately mitigated by its own contingency plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although a substantial portion of the company s liabilities are non recourse  fixed interest rate instruments  the company is reliant upon lines of credit and other financing facilities which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
should interest rates significantly increase  the company would incur higher interest expense  and to the extent that the company is unable to recover these higher costs  potentially lower earnings
