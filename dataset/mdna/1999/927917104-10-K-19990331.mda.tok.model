general vitalcom provides computer networks and related radio communications products that acquire  interpret and distribute real time monitoring information 
the company s radio and computer networks acquire physiologic data generated by its own proprietary ecg monitors and other manufacturers bedside equipment located throughout a healthcare facility 
the company s products are sold through a direct sales force to acute care hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks ihdns and on an original equipment manufacturer oem basis to patient monitoring equipment manufacturers 
revenues from sales of enterprise wide monitoring systems sold by the company s direct sales force are recognized upon shipment 
the sales cycle for enterprise wide monitoring systems has typically been from nine to months 
the company has experienced seasonal variations in sales of its enterprise wide monitoring systems  with sales in the first quarter typically lower than the preceding fourth quarter s sales due to customer budget cycles and sales remaining relatively flat during the third quarter 
furthermore  a large percentage of a particular quarter s shipments of enterprise wide monitoring systems has historically been booked in the last weeks of the quarter 
revenues from sales of oem products are recognized upon shipment 
the selling cycle for oem products varies depending upon product mix and the extent to which the company develops customized operating software for a particular oem customer 
in addition  the company has experienced seasonal variations in sales of its departmental products  with sales in the first quarter typically lower than the preceding fourth quarter s sales and third quarter sales of oem products generally being lower than other quarters 
the company s products are generally shipped as orders are received and  accordingly  the company typically operates with limited backlog 
as a result  sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
to date  the company has not capitalized software development expenses 
however  the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products may require capitalization of such expenses in the future

annual results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain statements of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses operating loss other income  net loss before provision benefit for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss comparison of the years ended  and total revenues 
total revenues consist of revenue from sales of enterprise wide monitoring systems and oem products  together with fees for installation and servicing of products 
total revenues decreased to million in from million in total revenues increased to million in from million in revenues from enterprise wide monitoring systems sales decreased to million in from million in revenues from enterprise wide monitoring systems sales increased to million in from million in revenues from oem product sales decreased to million in from million in revenues from oem product sales increased to million in from million in the decrease in enterprise wide monitoring systems sales in was due to the continued difficulty the company has experienced rebuilding its sales force and funnel of potential new business from the direct sales business development restructuring 
since the enterprise wide sales cycle can extend up to months  the development of a mature and dependable funnel of new business takes time to develop  thus the company was reliant upon its existing customer base for the majority of its enterprise wide monitoring systems revenues 
the increase in sales of enterprise wide monitoring systems in reflects increases in sales from the company s installed base who expanded their systems 
the decrease in oem product sales in reflects the reduction in sales to the company s largest oem customer  due to weaker demand in their departmental monitoring market 
in  oem product sales increased from due to the increased market demand for central monitoring system solutions sold by the company s two largest oem customers 
gross margins 
cost of goods sold generally includes material  direct labor  overhead and  for enterprise wide monitoring systems  installation expenses 
cost of sales decreased to million from million in  on a decrease in revenues in cost of sales increased to million in from million in  on a revenue increase in gross margins were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in as compared to was due to price decreases in material costs for personal computer and rf board assembly materials and reduced overhead costs for overtime  product liability insurance and warranty costs 
gross margin in was identical to as the absorption of fixed costs remained consistent from year to year 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include payroll  commissions and related personnel costs attributable to enterprise wide monitoring systems and oem sales and marketing personnel  travel and entertainment expenses  and other promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  to million in from million in sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in from was due to lower salaries and commission expenses associated with the reduction in sales personnel  lower travel expenses and a reduction in marketing and promotion costs 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in was primarily attributable to a decrease in customer relations expenses as expenses included voluntary upgrades to selected enterprise wide monitoring systems customers to provide an upgrade path for future expansion and sales to these customers 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include payroll and related costs attributable to research and development personnel  prototyping expenses and other costs 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in research and development expenses decreased in from due to lower salary expenses associated with the lower headcount in research and development expenses decreased in from due primarily to a lower number of research and development personnel and reduced spending for prototype and test equipment

general and administrative expenses include accounting  finance  mis  human resources  general administration  executive officers and professional fee expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the decrease in spending in in comparison to was primarily due to the reduction in legal and professional fees 
the slight increase in spending in as compared to is attributable to headcount increases and related recruiting and relocation expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on proceeds from the company s initial public offering  net of payments made in respect of outstanding indebtedness 
other income  net  in decreased to  in income as compared to income of  in this decrease was due to lower income derived from the short term investments in comparison to the prior year

the company expects to spend approximately million for capital expenditures during the company believes that existing cash resources  cash flows from operations  if any  and line of credit facilities will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for at least the next twelve months 
year computer systems compliance 
many computer systems  software  and electronic equipment accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
therefore for the year could be interpreted to be the year  resulting in an invalid date 
these systems will need to be changed to distinguish st century dates 
in addition  certain systems and products do not correctly process leap year dates 
as a result  in the next months  computer systems  software it systems  and other equipment  such as elevators  phones  office equipment  and manufacturing equipment used by many companies may need to be upgraded  repaired  or replaced to comply with year and leap year requirements 
the company s enterprise wide monitoring systems and oem central stations use a personal computer pc platform and include operating system  display  clinical analysis and networking software 
the company s research and development department has evaluated all company enterprise wide monitoring products built and shipped on or after january  test procedures included testing for a transition dates of december  to january  and december  to january   b leap year transition dates of february  to february  and february  to march   c a powered down rollover test  d a powered up rollover test  e a check of the date and time of history events and full disclosure on monitor displays  f alarms set and check for correct functioning after the transition dates and times and f verification for printouts for a three month period during the transition dates 
the company tested a total of hardware and software combinations 
all products the company is currently selling and installing are yk compliant 
of the product combinations tested combinations are compliant and yk certified  are compliant with a simple workaround such as a power down and power up  are not fully compliant  but which have relatively simple workarounds to provide a solution for the product to make it compliant  and that are not compliant and have no workaround 
all of the company s enterprise wide monitoring customers have received a technical bulletin explaining the status of the company s yk compliance requirements and applicable workarounds  if necessary 
recently the company expanded its testing beyond the generally accepted yk criteria enumerated above to include testing for dates of january  and beyond 
preliminary tests indicate the company s based personal computer products that printed reports display an invalid date or a date two days prior to the actual date or event 
the company has just recently learned of this information and as such is continuing to test hardware and software combinations to determine the extent of year and beyond printing anomalies 
the company believes that it does not have any contractual obligation to update or replace any software or equipment for its customers at no charge 
the company s oem customers are responsible for yk compliance and support for their end user customers 
all of the company s transmitters  receivers rf products and display monitors are year compliant based on the fact that none of these devices contain a real time clock that would pose a year date compliance issue 
the company has conducted an internal review of most of its internal systems  including inventory  manufacturing  planning  finance  human resources  payroll  automation  laboratory  and research systems 
the systems affected by the year problem are divided into eight categories including the company s enterprise wide monitoring systems and oem central stations discussed above 
business computer systems comprise any mainframe  midrange  or pc based computer system used in corporate operations 
these systems generally involve application code provided by third party vendors supported by internal staff 
technical infrastructure are specific computer and process control software systems 
end user computing comprise the pc and server based office automation 
suppliers  agents  and service providers comprise the software formulated by our suppliers  banks  utilities  and other suppliers 
manufacturing  warehousing  servicing equipment comprise the equipment on our factory floor and warehouse areas that may be date dependent  especially micro processor controlled devices 
environmental operations in plant  offices and other sites comprise the company s hvac  security access system  elevators  pbx  fire and alarm systems  and other systems of this nature 
dedicated research and development test facilities comprise controllers  devices  instruments etc 
in the company s test facilities 
as part of the company s review to assure compliance with year  the company has formed a task force the task force to oversee year and leap year issues 
the task force has reviewed all it systems and non it systems that have been determined not to be year and leap year compliant and has identified and begun implementation of solutions to ensure such compliance 
the company has prioritized the remediation effort to fix critical business systems first  non critical systems second  and cosmetic changes to reports and displays last 
key critical business systems  such as financials general ledger  purchasing  accounts payable  accounts receivable and fixed assets and material requirements planning  are currently compliant 
remaining critical and non critical business systems are expected to be completed by mid and cosmetic changes to reports and displays are anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of as part of contingency planning  the company is developing procedures for those areas that are critical to its business 
these plans will be designed to mitigate serious disruptions to the business beyond the end of the major efforts in contingency planning occurred in the last quarter of with the expectation that contingency plans will be in place by the end of the second quarter of based on current plans and efforts to date  the company does not anticipate that year problems will have a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition 
the company has contacted its major customers  vendors  and service suppliers whose systems failures potentially could have a significant impact on the company s operations to verify their year readiness to determine potential exposure to year issues 
the company has been informed by percent of its major customers  vendors  and service suppliers that such suppliers will be year compliant by the year failure of these third parties systems to timely achieve year compliance could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects of the company 
year problems could affect many of the company s production  distribution  plant equipment  financial and administrative operations 
systems critical to the business which have been identified as non year compliant are either being replaced or corrected through programming modifications 
remediation of problems discovered will be corrected through internal efforts  vendor upgrades  replacement  or decommissioning of obsolete systems and equipment 
external and internal costs associated with these efforts are currently expected to be approximately  as of december   the company had spent less than  on costs associated with the year effort 
the company does not expect the costs relating to year remediation to have a material effect on results of operations or financial condition 
the company has not determined the state of compliance of certain third party suppliers of services such as phone companies  long distance carriers  financial institutions and electric companies 
the failure of any one could severely disrupt the company s ability to carry on its business as will as disrupt the business of the company s customers 
failure to provide year and leap year compliant business solutions to customers or to receive such business solutions from its suppliers could result in liability to the company or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company could be affected through disruptions in the operation of the enterprises with which the company interacts or from general widespread problems or an economic crisis resulting from non compliant year systems 
despite the company s efforts to address the year effect on its internal systems and business operations  such effect could result in a material disruption of its business or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no

sfas establishes standards for the reporting of information about operating segments of a business and is reported in note of the notes to the financial statements 
in june  the fasb released statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for derivatives used for hedging activities 
it requires that all derivatives be recognized either as an asset or liability  and measures them at fair value 
sfas is effective for all fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that the application of sfas will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in october  the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop  software revenue recognition  which supercedes sop and is effective for transactions entered into for fiscal years beginning after december  while some principles remain the same  there are several key differences between the two pronouncements  including accounting for multiple element arrangements 
sop addresses revenue recognition from a conceptual level and does not specifically provide implementation guidance 
management believes the implementation of sop did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in march  the american institute of certified public accountants issued sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop provides guidance on accounting for the costs of computer software  developed or obtained for internal use and requires costs incurred in the application development stage whether internal or external to be capitalized 
this sop is applicable to all financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe the implementation of sop will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash and long term debt 
at december   the carrying values of the company s financial instruments approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates 
it is the company s policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
the company does not currently have any foreign currency exposure since it does not transact business in foreign currencies 
due to this  the company does not have significant overall currency exposure at december  european monetary union within europe  the european economic and monetary union the emu introduced a new currency  the euro  on january  the new currency is in response to the emu s policy of economic convergence to harmonize trade policy  eliminate business costs associated with currency exchange and to promote the free flow of capital  goods and services 
on january   the participating countries adopted the euro as their local currency  initially available for currency trading on currency exchanges and non cash transactions such as banking 
the existing local currencies  or legacy currencies  will remain legal tender through january  beginning on january   euro denominated bills and coins will be issued for cash transactions 
for a period of up to six months from this date  both legacy currencies and the euro will be legal tender 
on or before july   the participating countries will withdraw all legacy currencies and exclusively use the euro 
the company s transactions are recorded in us dollars and the company does not currently anticipate future transactions being recorded in the euro 
based on the lack of transactions recorded in the euro  the company does not believe that the euro will have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
in addition  the company has not incurred and does not expect to incur any significant costs from the continued implementation of the euro  including any currency risk  which could materially affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company has not experienced any significant operational disruptions to date and does not currently expect the continued implementation of the euro to cause any significant operational disruptions 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this annual report on form k  including the information set forth in part i  item business  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements include those regarding the company s ability to shorten stays in costly intensive care icu and cardiac care ccu units  increase medical staff productivity  reduce costly patient transfers  leverage the use of existing equipment  improve facility utilization  healthcare providers changing operations and increasingly focusing on controlling the cost of delivering care  facilitating the implementation of telemedicine with the company s sitelink application  the company s possible election in the future to incorporate in its oem products the hardware and software for larger networks and expand to other oem customers the ability for real time redistribution of information to remote viewing stations  the company s intention to expand its opennet application with interfaces to additional patient monitoring or ventilator devices  the company s intent to make additional connections between its enterprise wide monitoring systems and other hcis products and computerized patient records  the outcome of any regulatory development  the probable fcc licensing of a new band for medical telemetry and the company s intent to develop rf products to operate in this new band  potential new products  rebuilding of the company s funnel of potential new enterprise wide monitoring systems sales  sequential growth in enterprise wide monitoring systems sales  the company s working capital position  the company s estimated expenditures for year compliance  the expected effect of year compliance on the company and the effect and timing of year compliance on the company s customers 
actual results may vary substantially from these foward looking statements for many reasons  including but not limited to those set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations risk factors 
risk factors dependence on increased market acceptance of enterprise wide monitoring systems 
in  sales of the company s enterprise wide systems decreased to million from million in in  sales of the company s enterprise wide monitoring systems increased to million from million in in  sales of the company s enterprise wide monitoring systems decreased to million from million in since  the company s sales levels for its enterprise wide monitoring systems has been lower than expected  which  together with investments and expense levels that are incurred based on the expectation of higher sales  has resulted in net losses in each year since and have had a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
if the company is not successful in increasing sales levels of its enterprise wide monitoring systems in future periods  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will continue to be materially adversely affected 
in addition  although the company s enterprise wide monitoring products have been installed in more than hospitals  there is no assurance that the company s products will achieve the hospital penetration necessary to increase sales 
fluctuations in quarterly results 
the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to the size and timing of orders  the length of the sales cycle  the company s success in expanding its sales and marketing programs and the effects of changes in sales force alignment  the ability of the company s customers to obtain budget allocations for the purchase of the company s products  changes in pricing policies or price reductions by the company or its competitors  mix of sales between enterprise wide monitoring systems and oem products  the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements  the company s ability to develop  introduce and market new products and product enhancements  market acceptance of new products or product enhancements  the company s ability to control costs  the availability of components  costs associated with responding to software bugs or errors  regulatory compliance and timing of regulatory clearances  changes in government regulations and other regulatory developments  and general economic factors 
the company s products are generally shipped as orders are received and  accordingly  the company has historically operated with limited backlog 
as a result  sales in any quarter are dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and are not predictable with any degree of certainty 
further  a large percentage of any quarter s shipments have historically been booked in the last weeks of the quarter 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  and the amount and timing of increases in such expenses are based in large part on the company s expectations for future revenues 
if revenues are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse effect may be magnified by the company s inability to maintain gross margins and to decrease spending to compensate for the revenue shortfall 
this dynamic has contributed to the company s net losses in the past 
further  the company has sometimes experienced seasonal variations in operating results  with sales in the first quarter being lower than in the preceding fourth quarter s sales due to customer budget cycles and sales remaining relatively flat during the third quarter 
lengthy sales cycle 
the decision by a healthcare provider to replace or substantially upgrade its clinical information systems typically involves a major commitment of capital and an extended review and approval process  and this review and approval process is becoming more complex  more financially oriented and increasingly subject to overall integration into the hospital s information systems planning 
the sales cycle for the company s enterprise wide monitoring systems has typically been nine to months from initial contact to receipt of a purchase order 
during this period  the company expends substantial time  effort and funds preparing a contract proposal and negotiating a purchase order without any guarantee that the company will complete the transaction 
any significant or ongoing failure to reach definitive agreements with customers has in the past and may in the future have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
possible delisting of securities from the nasdaq national market 
the company s common stock trades on the nasdaq national market 
the nasdaq national market s continued listing standards require the company to have i  share publicly held  ii a market value of publicly held shares of million  iii net tangible assets of at least million  iv shareholders of round lots  and v a minimum bid price of at least per share 
the company believes that it currently does not meet item ii above  and it is possible that the company could fall below other criteria in the future  particularly item v above 
accordingly  the company may be subject to possible delisting procedures in the future from the nasdaq national market and this would adversely affect the ability or willingness of investors to purchase the company s securities and therefore would severely adversely affect the market liquidity for the company s securities 
competition 
the company s enterprise wide monitoring systems compete with systems offered by a number of competitors  including hewlett packard company  spacelabs  inc and general electric company  all of which have significantly greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  many of these competitors have longstanding relationships with acute care hospitals and ihdns 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell to such hospitals or ihdns or that the company will be able to compete successfully with such vendors  and any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
while the company is not aware of any competitive open system multi parameter enterprise wide monitoring systems currently available  the company s opennet applications may face significant competition in the future from hcis providers  patient monitoring companies  life support device companies and general purpose data network providers 
such potential competitors may elect to enter this market and compete with the company using significantly greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than are available to the company 
in addition  the company s success in selling its multi parameter opennet networks to hospitals and ihdns will depend to a large extent on its ability to interface with patient monitoring and life support devices of other vendors 
any action on the part of such other vendors to make such interfacing more difficult or impossible could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the market for the company s oem products is also intensely competitive 
the company sells to a range of patient monitoring and life support device companies  many of which have significantly greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than the company 
there can be no assurance that current oem customers will not elect to design and manufacture patient monitoring and system components currently supplied by the company or elect to contract with other oem suppliers 
any such election by one or more of such companies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company may in the future elect to incorporate in its oem products the hardware and software for larger networks and expand the number of oem customers with the hardware and software required for real time redistribution of information to remote viewing stations for use in specialty departments of hospitals for which the company s oem customers design and sell their products 
although the company believes that its oem customers would not compete with its enterprise wide monitoring systems because the enterprise wide monitoring systems are sold to hospitals and ihdns who elect to install larger  more dispersed systems  the company could face competition with its oem customers to the extent hospitals forego purchasing the company s facility wide enterprise wide monitoring systems for the smaller departmental systems of its oem customers 
customer concentration  dependence on departmental products 
the company s oem product sales  which represented approximately  and of the company s total net revenues in  and  respectively  have historically been to a small number of oem customers 
in  quinton instrument company quinton and datascope corporation datascope accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues and in quinton and datascope accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
the loss of  or a reduction in sales to  any such oem customer would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
technological change  need to develop new products 
many aspects of the medical equipment industry are undergoing rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
historically  the company derived substantially all of its revenue from sales of its enterprise wide monitoring systems and oem products 
the company believes that as the market for these products matures  vitalcom s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements that keep pace with technological developments and that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of acute care hospitals and ihdns 
in addition  the introduction of competing products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s existing products unmarketable or obsolete 
if the company is unable to develop and introduce product enhancements and new products in a timely and cost effective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  or if the company s new products or product enhancements  such as sitelink  do not achieve market acceptance  the company s business  operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
uncertainty and consolidation in healthcare industry 
the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operation of healthcare providers 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to create larger hospitals and ihdns 
this consolidation reduces the number of potential customers for the company s products  and the increased bargaining power of these organizations could lead to reductions in the amounts paid for the company s products 
these larger hospitals and ihdns may concentrate their purchases on a small number of preferred vendors with whom they have had longstanding relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sell to such hospitals or ihdns or that the company will be able to compete successfully with such vendors 
the impact of these developments in the healthcare industry is difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
government regulation 
the manufacture and sale of medical devices  including the company s products  is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities 
in the united states  the company s products are regulated as medical devices and are subject to the food and drug administration s pre clearance or approval requirements 
the company has received clearance from the fda to market its current products through the k premarket notification process 
there can be no assurance that a similar k clearance for any future product or enhancement of an existing product will be granted or that the process will not be lengthy 
if the company cannot establish that a product is substantially equivalent to certain legally marketed devices  or if fda regulatory changes currently under consideration with respect to arrhythmia software are adopted  the k clearance procedure will be unavailable and company will be required to utilize the longer and more expensive premarket approval pma process 
failure to receive or delays in receipt of fda clearances or approvals  including the need for extensive clinical trials or additional data as a prerequisite to clearance or approval  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
sales of medical devices and components outside of the united states are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain further clearance or approvals for its products or components on a timely basis or at all  and delays in receipt of  loss of or failure to receive such approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s radio frequency transmitter devices are subject to regulation by the federal communication commission fcc  and applicable approvals must be obtained before shipment of such products 
the company believes that all of its products designated for sale in the united states meet applicable federal communications commission fcc regulations  including us fcc part for electromagnetic emissions 
the fcc approval process starts with the collection of test data that demonstrates that a product meets the requirements stated in part of the fcc regulations 
this data is then included as part of a report and application that is submitted to the fcc requesting approval 
the fcc may grant or request additional information or withhold approval 
any failure of the company s products to conform to governmental regulations or any delay or failure to obtain required fcc approvals in the future  if any  could cause the delay or loss of sales of the company s products and therefore have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and result of operations 
the company s proprietary radio frequency rf communication products transmit real time physiologic information from the patient to the central surveillance station 
these communication products currently operate in three radio bands vhf mhz to mhz  shared with tv channels  uhf mhz to mhz  shared with land mobile users  and the mhz radio band mhz to mhz licensed for spread spectrum operation 
the majority of the company s rf products use the vacant television frequencies in the vhf band 
the fcc is requiring all television stations to implement digital broadcasting transmission for high definition television hdtv 
major metropolitan areas were required to implement hdtv by december  and other markets will be required to implement by december  in order to implement hdtv the fcc has granted each tv channel an additional mhz channel for digital broadcasting until the transition period ends  at which time the broadcaster would return one of the two channels 
as tv stations use the additional mhz channel for the digital broadcasting transition  which may take years  they may overlap into the radio spectrum which has been used for medical rf applications 
customers of the company s lower power rf communication products may begin seeing more interference in the future 
this interference may result in the company s hospital biomedical personnel having to re tune the company s rf transmitters to other channels in order to reduce interference 
in the event of high interference the company s customers may need to purchase equipment to transmit in the uhf frequency range 
in the fcc expanded the usable uhf frequencies for medical rf from the licensed mhz to mhz band to the previously unlicensed mhz to mhz frequency range 
with vhf frequency ranges available for medical rf use potentially becoming more limited and the uhf frequency ranges expanding  the company s competitors who have historically focused their rf products in what was the more limited uhf band  may now have a competitive advantage as compared to the company  until such time as the company expands its uhf rf product offerings 
any such competitive advantage of the company s competitors and any additional development costs associated with expanding the company s uhf rf product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
during the company joined a task force created by the american hospital association aha and the fda called the spectrum selection workgroup medical telemetry task force the task force along with several other medical rf users  including its competitors 
the purpose of the task force is to respond to potential interference problems from hdtv  land mobile users and low power television to wireless patient monitoring devices 
the task force s mission is to identify spectrum candidates for future medical telemetry use  evaluate use and make recommendations to the fcc 
as such the task force has petitioned the fcc to license the uhf mhz to mhz band  currently reserved for radio astronomy  for medical use 
it is anticipated that the task force will submit its petition during the first half of  with proposed rule making and public commentary to follow 
the task force will ask the fcc to expedite licensing for medical rf applications in the mhz to mhz band 
in the event the fcc approves this license  which the company believes is probable  the company may be at a disadvantage in the marketplace if one or some of its competitors develop and introduce rf products in this new band before the company introduces products in the new band  resulting in lost or delayed revenues 
in addition  the costs of developing rf transmitter and receiver products in this new band could be expensive or divert research and development resources from other projects resulting in higher costs and delayed projects 
any such competitive advantage of the company s competitors and any additional development costs associated with expanding the company s uhf rf product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  future regulatory changes could significantly affect the company s operations by diverting the company s development efforts  making current products obsolete or increasing the opportunity for additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
limited intellectual property protection 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its intellectual property 
the company seeks to protect its software  circuitry documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
the company cannot assure that its protective measures for proprietary rights will be adequate or that the company s competitors will not independently develop similar or superior technology  duplicate the company s products or otherwise circumvent its intellectual property rights 
although the company has never received a claim that its products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that third parties will not in the future claim infringement by the company with respect to current or future products or proprietary rights 
any such claims  regardless of their merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  delay or prevent product shipments or require the company to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
the impact of any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
risk of product liability claims 
certain of the company s products provide applications that relate to patient physiologic status or other clinically critical information 
any failure by the company s products to provide accurate and timely information could result in product liability and warranty claims against the company by its customers or their patients 
the company maintains insurance against claims associated with the use of its products  but there can be no assurance that its insurance coverage would adequately cover any claim asserted against the company 
a successful claim brought against the company in excess of its insurance coverage or outside the scope of the company s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company in the past had to incur warranty expenditures for upgrades that had adverse expenses to the periods 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and diversion of management time and resources 
year computer systems compliance 
many computer systems  software  and electronic equipment accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
therefore for the year could be interpreted to be the year  resulting in an invalid date 
these systems will need to be changed to distinguish st century dates 
in addition  certain systems and products do not correctly process leap year dates 
as a result  in the next months  computer systems  software it systems  and other equipment  such as elevators  phones  office equipment  and manufacturing equipment used by many companies may need to be upgraded  repaired  or replaced to comply with year and leap year requirements 
the company s enterprise wide monitoring systems and oem central stations use a personal computer pc platform and include operating system  display  clinical analysis and networking software 
the company s research and development department has evaluated all company enterprise wide monitoring products built and shipped on or after january  test procedures included testing for a transition dates of december  to january  and december  to january   b leap year transition dates of february  to february  and february  to march   c a powered down rollover test  d a powered up rollover test  e a check of the date and time of history events and full disclosure on monitor displays  f alarms set and check for correct functioning after the transition dates and times and f verification for printouts for a three month period during the transition dates 
the company tested a total of hardware and software combinations 
all products the company is currently selling and installing are yk compliant 
of the product combinations tested combinations are compliant and yk certified  are compliant with a simple workaround such as a power down and power up  are not fully compliant  but which have relatively simple workarounds to provide a solution for the product to make it compliant  and that are not compliant and have no workaround 
all of the company s enterprise wide monitoring customers have received a technical bulletin explaining the status of the company s yk compliance requirements and applicable workarounds  if necessary 
recently the company expanded its testing beyond the generally accepted yk criteria enumerated above to include testing for dates of january  and beyond 
preliminary tests indicate the company s based personal computer products that printed reports display an invalid date or a date two days prior to the actual date or event 
the company has just recently learned of this information and as such is continuing to test hardware and software combinations to determine the extent of year and beyond printing anomalies 
the company believes that it does not have any contractual obligation to update or replace any software or equipment for its customers at no charge 
the company s oem customers are responsible for yk compliance and support for their end user customers 
all of the company s transmitters  receivers rf products and display monitors are year compliant based on the fact that none of these devices contain a real time clock that would pose a year date compliance issue 
the company has conducted an internal review of most of its internal systems  including inventory  manufacturing  planning  finance  human resources  payroll  automation  laboratory  and research systems 
the systems affected by the year problem are divided into eight categories including the company s enterprise wide monitoring systems and oem central stations discussed above 
business computer systems comprise any mainframe  midrange  or pc based computer system used in corporate operations 
these systems generally involve application code provided by third party vendors supported by internal staff 
technical infrastructure are specific computer and process control software systems 
end user computing comprise the pc and server based office automation 
suppliers  agents  and service providers comprise the software formulated by our suppliers  banks  utilities  and other suppliers 
manufacturing  warehousing  servicing equipment comprise the equipment on our factory floor and warehouse areas that may be date dependent  especially micro processor controlled devices 
environmental operations in plant  offices and other sites comprise the company s hvac  security access system  elevators  pbx  fire and alarm systems  and other systems of this nature 
dedicated research and development test facilities comprise controllers  devices  instruments etc 
in the company s test facilities 
as part of the company s review to assure compliance with year  the company has formed a task force the task force to oversee year and leap year issues 
the task force has reviewed all it systems and non it systems that have been determined not to be year and leap year compliant and has identified and begun implementation of solutions to ensure such compliance 
the company has prioritized the remediation effort to fix critical business systems first  non critical systems second  and cosmetic changes to reports and displays last 
key critical business systems  such as financials general ledger  purchasing  accounts payable  accounts receivable and fixed assets and material requirements planning  are currently compliant 
remaining critical and non critical business systems are expected to be completed by mid and cosmetic changes to reports and displays are anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of as part of contingency planning  the company is developing procedures for those areas that are critical to its business 
these plans will be designed to mitigate serious disruptions to the business beyond the end of the major efforts in contingency planning occurred in the last quarter of with the expectation that contingency plans will be in place by the end of the second quarter of based on current plans and efforts to date  the company does not anticipate that year problems will have a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition 
the company has contacted its major customers  vendors  and service suppliers whose systems failures potentially could have a significant impact on the company s operations to verify their year readiness to determine potential exposure to year issues 
the company has been informed by percent of its major customers  vendors  and service suppliers that such suppliers will be year compliant by the year failure of these third parties systems to timely achieve year compliance could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects of the company 
year problems could affect many of the company s production  distribution  plant equipment  financial and administrative operations 
systems critical to the business which have been identified as non year compliant are either being replaced or corrected through programming modifications 
remediation of problems discovered will be corrected through internal efforts  vendor upgrades  replacement  or decommissioning of obsolete systems and equipment 
external and internal costs associated with these efforts are currently expected to be approximately  as of december   the company had spent less than  on costs associated with the year effort 
the company does not expect the costs relating to year remediation to have a material effect on results of operations or financial condition 
the company has not determined the state of compliance of certain third party suppliers of services such as phone companies  long distance carriers  financial institutions and electric companies 
the failure of any one could severely disrupt the company s ability to carry on its business as will as disrupt the business of the company s customers 
failure to provide year and leap year compliant business solutions to customers or to receive such business solutions from its suppliers could result in liability to the company or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company could be affected through disruptions in the operation of the enterprises with which the company interacts or from general widespread problems or an economic crisis resulting from non compliant year systems 
despite the company s efforts to address the year effect on its internal systems and business operations  such effect could result in a material disruption of its business or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on sole source components  component  assembly systems obsolescence 
certain of the company s products utilize components that are available in the short term only from a single or a limited number of sources  have been available only on an allocation basis in the past and could be in scarce supply again in the future 
any inability to obtain components in the amounts needed on a timely basis or at commercially reasonable prices could result in delays in product introductions  interruption in product shipments or increases in product costs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition until alternative sources could be developed or design and manufacturing changes could be completed 
in addition  from time to time  certain components  subassemblies and systems used by the company are discontinued by manufacturers  requiring the company to replace the components  subassembly or system with an equivalent product or if no such equivalent can be identified to modify and re validate the product design 
any inability to obtain such components on a timely basis or at commercially reasonable prices or to redesign the product in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition until alternative sources could be developed or design and manufacturing changes could be completed 
risks associated with recent management changes 
during and  the company has had a number of changes in its management team 
effective january   david l 
schlotterbeck stepped down as the company s chief executive officer  and donald j 
judson  the company s chairman of the board  assumed such responsibilities 
in march  the company hired a new vice president  direct sales and in july hired a new vice president  research and development 
in october  the company hired frank t 
sample as its new president and chief executive officer  with mr 
judson stepping down as such 
in july  stan reese stepped down as the company s vice president  research and development and was replaced by stephen hannah in december in august david clare stepped down as the company s vice president  direct sales and was replaced by patric wiesmann in march the addition of new senior management has involved increased salary levels which the company anticipates will result in increased administrative expenses in future periods 
such management changes can also involve disruptions in the company s day to day operations  can interrupt continuity in customer relationships and create delays in sales cycles or product release schedules 
although the company believes that its new senior management will be successful in improving the company s business  operating results and financial condition  there can be no assurance that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition in future periods 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a large extent on its ability to attract and retain key personnel 
the loss of the services  either temporarily or permanently  of any of the members of senior management or other key employees  particularly in sales and marketing and research and development  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the company s future success depends to a large extent on its ability to attract and retain additional key management  sales and marketing and research and development personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company s financial instruments include cash and long term debt 
at december   the carrying values of the company s financial instruments approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates 
it is the company s policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
the company does not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure since it does not transact business in foreign currencies 
due to this  the company does not have significant overall currency exposure at december  the company s market risk disclosures are not material and are therefore not required
