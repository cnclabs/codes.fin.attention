this collaboration may provide the company with an equity investment  research funding and potential milestone payments of up to  the company is entitled to receive royalties from sales of therapeutic products sold by novartis 
in september  the company commenced a five year collaborative research and development arrangement with bayer corporation bayer 
this collaboration provides the company with an equity investment  research funding and potential milestone payments of up to  in november and again in december  the company announced expansions of its collaborative research and development arrangement with bayer 
the expanded collaboration may provide the company with additional research funding and potential milestone payments of up to  the company is entitled to receive royalties from sales of therapeutic products sold by bayer 
in october  the company announced the introduction of bracanalysis tm  a comprehensive brca and brca gene sequence analysis for susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer 
in january  the company announced the introduction of cardiarisk tm which may assist physicians both in i identifying which hypertensive patients are at a significantly increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and ii identifying which patients are likely to respond to low salt diet therapy and antihypertensive drug therapy 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiary myriad genetic laboratories  inc  recognized molecular diagnostic revenues  primarily from bracanalysis tm  of  for the year ended june  in april  the company commenced a three year collaborative research and development arrangement with schering corporation schering 
the three year term may be extended for two additional one year periods 
this collaboration provides the company with an equity investment  license fees  research funding and potential milestone payments totalling up to  the company is entitled to receive royalties from sales of therapeutic products sold by schering 
in october  the company entered into a five year collaboration with schering ag  germany schering ag  to utilize the company s protein interaction technology pronet tm for drug discovery and development 
under the agreement  the company will have an option to co promote all new therapeutic products in north america and receive percent of the profits from north american sales of all new drugs discovered with pronet tm 
this collaboration may provide the company with licensing fees  subscription fees  option payments and milestone fees with a value of up to  if the company chooses to co promote the drug as a percent partner  the company may be required to pay funds to schering ag to establish equal ownership 
in november  the company entered into a month collaboration with monsanto company monsanto  to utilize pronet tm for drug discovery and development 
under the agreement  monsanto has the option to extend the research term for an additional twelve months 
if the anticipated milestones  option payments  license fees and upfront payments are achieved  the value of the agreement may reach up to  the company will also receive royalties on worldwide sales of drugs resulting from the discovery of novel targets found through use of the pronet tm technology 
the company intends to enter into additional collaborative relationships to locate and sequence genes and discover protein networks associated with other common diseases as well as continuing to fund internal research projects 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to enter into additional collaborative relationships on terms acceptable to the company 
the company expects to incur losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to expansion of its research and development programs  increased staffing costs and expansion of its facilities 
additionally  the company expects to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building its molecular diagnostic business 
the company expects that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
results of operations years ended june  and research revenues for the company s fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  greater research revenue recognized during the fiscal year ended june  versus the current fiscal year is the result of  in research milestones and contract expansion payments received by the company in excluding the milestone and contract expansion payments  the company s ongoing research revenue increased  for the fiscal year ended june  versus fiscal research revenue from the research collaboration agreements is generally recognized as related costs are incurred 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  revenues increase or decrease proportionately 
molecular diagnostic revenues of  were recognized in the fiscal year ended june   an increase of or  over the prior year 
molecular diagnostic revenue is comprised of sales of diagnostic tests resulting from the company s discovery of disease genes 
the test for genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer was launched by the company in october and the test for heart disease and hypertension risk was launched by the company in january sales and marketing efforts since that time have given rise to the increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  there can be no assurance  however that molecular diagnostic revenues will continue to increase at the historical rate 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased to  from  for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in research activities as a result of the company s collaborations with novartis  bayer  schering  schering ag  and monsanto  as well as those programs funded by the company 
the increased level of research spending includes ongoing development of the company s pronet tm and mutation screening technologies  third party sponsored research programs  and the formation of myriad pharmaceuticals  inc myriad pharmaceuticals 
myriad pharmaceuticals  a wholly owned subsidiary  was created to develop therapeutic lead compounds for selected common diseases with large potential markets that are under served by current therapeutic options 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  decreased  from the fiscal year ended june  during the fiscal year ended june   the company was pursuing a plan to dramatically increase its sales force 
start up expenses for the sales staff included training  relocation  and sales supplies 
for the fiscal year ended june   the company maintained a steady  well trained sales force which resulted in fewer selling expenses 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred significant expenses in defense of its intellectual property  including the successful settlement of legal actions with oncormed 
such expenses were drastically reduced during the fiscal year ended june  the company expects its selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate as needed in support of its molecular diagnostic business and its research and development efforts 
interest income for the fiscal year ended june  decreased to  from  for the prior year 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities were  at june  as compared to  at june  this decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable investment securities was attributable to expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of business and has resulted in reduced interest income 
interest expense for the year ended june   amounting to  was due entirely to borrowings under the company s equipment financing facility 
years ended june  and research revenues for the company s fiscal year ended june  increased  from the prior year to  the increase was attributable primarily to the achievement of certain research milestones with novartis and schering and the company s new and expanded corporate research collaboration agreements with schering and bayer 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company recognized  in research milestones consisting of  from novartis and  from schering 
during the same period  the company recognized  in research funding from schering under an agreement initiated in april research revenue from the research collaboration agreements is recognized as related costs are incurred 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase  revenues increase proportionately 
molecular diagnostic revenues of  were recognized in the fiscal year ended june   an increase of or  over the prior year 
the test for genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer was launched by the company in october and the test for heart disease and hypertension risk was launched by the company in january sales and marketing efforts since that time have given rise to the increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  there can be no assurance  however that molecular diagnostic revenues will continue to increase at the historical rate 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  increased to  from  for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in research activities as a result of progress in the company s collaborations with novartis  bayer and schering as well as those programs funded by the company 
the increased level of research spending includes third party research programs  increased depreciation charges related to purchasing of additional research equipment  the hiring of additional research personnel and the associated increase in use of laboratory supplies and reagents 
the company also incurred expenses related to milestones achieved by its academic collaborators 
such expenses will likely increase to the extent that the company enters into additional research agreements with third parties 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  increased  from the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the ongoing promotion of bracanalysis tm and the launch of cardiarisk tm  including the expansion of the company s internal sales staff from to employees 
additionally  the company expended significant amounts in the defense of its intellectual property  including the successful settlement of legal actions with oncormed 
the increase is also a result of additional administrative  marketing and education personnel  market research activities  educational material development  and facilities related costs 
the company expects its selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in support of its genetic predisposition testing business and its research and development efforts 
interest income for the fiscal year ended june  decreased to  from  or for the prior year 
the company has been able to maintain its cash reserves at a relatively constant level as a result of its ongoing collaborative research agreements  entering new collaborative agreements  achieving research milestones  and sales of its genetic tests 
as a result  interest income has not changed significantly from the prior year 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended june   amounting to  was due entirely to borrowings under the company s equipment financing facility 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was  during the fiscal year ended june  as compared to  used during the prior year 
trade receivables increased  between june  and june  this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in molecular diagnostic revenue during fiscal trade receivables as a percentage of molecular diagnostic revenue continues to be in the range for both june  and june  other receivables increased  during the fiscal year ended june  this increase is primarily the result of the company recognizing revenue for it s collaborative research projects which exceed the cash which the company has received 
the company receives funding from it s collaboration partners evenly over the life of each agreement while research revenue is recognized as expenses are incurred 
in past years  as many of the collaborative projects were in their start up phases  cash received exceeded the amount of revenue recognized  resulting in deferred revenue 
corresponding to the increase in other receivables  deferred revenue decreased  during the fiscal year ended june  prepaid expenses increased  during the fiscal year ended june  the increase is primarily due to advance payments to purchase lab supplies at a discount  advanced royalties  and insurance premiums 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by  during the fiscal year ended june  as a result of decreased accruals for unbilled work provided by the company s research collaborators  a reduction in unbilled legal fees  and payments for lab supplies and equipment which were accrued into the prior fiscal year 
the company s investing activities provided cash of  in the fiscal year ended june  and used cash of  in the fiscal year ended june  investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures for research equipment  office furniture  and facility improvements and marketable investment securities 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company shifted a portion of its investment in marketable securities to cash and cash equivalents from longer term investments in order to provide for ongoing corporate expenditures 
during the same period  the company entered into a leasing arrangement with general electric capital corporation ge capital 
under this agreement  the company sold equipment with a value  net of depreciation  of  net book value to ge capital 
the company received proceeds from ge capital equal to the net book value of the equipment 
financing activities provided  during the fiscal year ended june  the company paid  in principal to retire its equipment financing facility 
payments on the financing facility were offset by proceeds of  from the exercise of options during the period 
financing activities provided  during the fiscal year ended june  during the fiscal year ended june   proceeds received by the company of  from the exercise of options and warrants were offset by payments by the company of  to reduce principal owing on its equipment financing facility 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources will be adequate to maintain its current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time 
the company s future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors  including progress of the company s research and development programs  the results and cost of clinical correlation testing of the company s genetic tests  the costs of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  payments received under collaborative agreements  changes in collaborative research relationships  the costs associated with potential commercialization of its gene discoveries  if any  including the development of manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  the cost and availability of third party financing for capital expenditures  and administrative and legal expenses 
because of the company s significant long term capital requirements  the company intends to raise funds when conditions are favorable  even if it does not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
impact of the year issue the year issue is the result of computer programs using a two digit format  as opposed to four digits  to indicate the year 
any of the company s computer programs or other information systems that have time sensitive software or embedded microcontrollers may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations 
during fiscal  the company completed an initial review phase i of its information and non information technology systems 
this review included its existing and planned computer software and hardware 
the company has made an initial determination  based on its phase i review  that the costs and or consequences associated with the year issue are not expected to have a material effect on its business  operations or future financial condition 
a second  more in depth analysis phase ii is currently ongoing 
internally  phase ii will include the testing of internally developed systems 
although the internal portion of phase ii is substantially complete  it is not expected to be fully completed until september the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software and systems  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer and other information systems 
if required  the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software and systems for year modifications 
externally  phase ii of the company s preparations for the year issue consists of soliciting and obtaining certification of year compliance from third party software vendors and determining the readiness of its significant suppliers and customers 
if such modifications  conversions and or replacements are not made  are not completed timely  or if any of the company s suppliers or customers do not successfully deal with the year issue  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company could experience delays in receiving or sending its molecular diagnostic products that would increase its costs and that could cause the company to lose business and even customers and could subject the company to claims for damages 
problems with the year issue could also result in delays in the company invoicing its genetics testing customers or in the company receiving payments from them 
in addition  the company s research and development efforts which rely heavily on the storage and retrieval of electronic information could be interrupted resulting in significant delays in discovering genes  the loss of current collaborations  and the impairment of the company s ability to enter into new collaborations 
the severity of these possible problems would depend on the nature of the problem and how quickly it could be corrected or an alternative implemented  which is unknown at this time 
in the extreme  such problems could bring the company to a standstill 
while management has not yet specifically determined the costs associated with its year readiness efforts  monitoring and managing the year issue will result in additional direct and indirect costs to the company 
direct costs include potential charges by third party software vendors for product enhancements  costs involved in testing software products for year compliance and any resulting costs for developing and implementing contingency plans for critical software products which are not enhanced 
indirect costs will principally consist of the time devoted by existing employees in monitoring software vendor progress  testing enhanced software products and implementing any necessary contingency plans 
such costs have not been material to date 
both direct and indirect costs of addressing the year issue will be charged to earnings as incurred 
after evaluating its internal compliance efforts as well as the compliance of third parties as described above  the company will develop appropriate contingency plans to address situations in which various systems of the company  or of third parties with which the company does business  are not year compliant 
some risks of the year issue  however  are beyond the control of the company and its suppliers and customers 
for example  no preparations or contingency plan will protect the company from a downturn in economic activity caused by the possible ripple effect throughout the entire economy caused by the year issue 
subsequent event in july  the company entered into a two year collaboration and license agreement with the novartis agricultural discovery institute  inc nadii 
the genomic collaboration will focus on the discovery of the genetic structure of cereal crops 
the collaboration may provide the company with an upfront payment and research funding of up to  upon completion  nadii and the company intend to jointly offer commercial access to the genomic databases and share equally in any resulting proceeds 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company maintains an investment portfolio in accordance with its investment policy 
the primary objectives of the company s investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
the company s investment policy specifies credit quality standards for the company s investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the company s investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified either as available for sale or held to maturity 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts 
gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held to maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method 
the securities held in the company s investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the available for sale securities 
after a review of the company s marketable securities as of june   the company has determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of the company s marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the financial statements as a whole
