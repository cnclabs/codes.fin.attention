the company s certificate of incorporation and the business corporation law of new york provide for indemnification of officers and directors with respect to damages and legal fees incurred in connection with lawsuits against them arising by reason of serving the company 
due to the fact that certain members of the board have chosen to participate as plaintiffs in this lawsuit  the company may not have coverage under its officers and directors liability insurance policy

the company has been able to eliminate its cash overdraft defined as checks drawn in advance of future deposits as of march   and has positive working capital of  compared to negative working capital of  as of march  the cash overdraft and deficit in working capital at march  were due primarily to the bankruptcy of a former service agreement client  reductions in long term debt and to finance operating losses 
the company anticipates continued improvements in working capital with improved operating results and reductions in long term debt service requirements 
although the cash overdraft has been eliminated as of march   the company still experiences periodic overdrafts due to the timing of billings  collections and payroll dates 
the company finances vehicle purchases typically over three years and insurance through short term borrowings 
the company has no additional lines of credit other than discussed herein 
in the past  many computer software programs were written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
as a result  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this situation is generally referred to as the year issue 
if such a situation occurs  computer based information systems will be faced with problems potentially affecting hardware  software  networks and customer and vendor inter dependencies 
the effects of year issue may be experienced before  on or after january  and if not addressed  the impact on operations and financial reporting may range from minor errors to significant systems failures which could effect a company s ability to conduct normal business operations 
the only yk problems that we have encountered were in the general ledger programs  which reside only on the company s headquarters mainframe system 
this problem was corrected and tested prior to april  we have not encountered any other problems with regard to year issues since the fixes were implemented 
most of the company s desktop pc s are less than three years old and will not have a yk compatibility issue at all 
there are minimal desktop pc s that are older than three years  which may have a problem with sorting or searching for documents that are stored on the hard drive 
this potential problem will not warrant purchasing replacement pc s 
as of april   the company has completed the year system evaluation  testing and implementation and found that we are fully year compliant 
the company is in the process of determining its contingency plans which will include identification of its most reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
once the company receives replies to its third party inquiries  it will be in a better position to evaluate the impact of reasonably likely worst case scenarios 
based on currently available information  given reasonably likely worse case scenarios  the company s year issues and any potential interruptions  costs  damages or losses related thereto  are not expected to be material 
the company believes that its compliance efforts have and will reduce the impact of such issues on the company 
the company has expended  through march   in connection with outside consultants for services related to year issues 
all such expenditures have been charged to the company s financial statement as an expense 
in the event the company has any unanticipated equipment purchases to replace non compliant systems  these expenditures will be capitalized 
any costs associated with replacement equipment are not expected to be material 
the company has not tracked internal labor costs because the company believes these costs to be immaterial 
the balance of internal labor costs associated with year compliance is also expected to be immaterial but there can be no assurance that unanticipated costs will not be incurred 
cautionary statement as provided for under the private securities litigation reform act of  the company wishes to caution shareholders and investors that the following important factors  among others  could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements in this report 
the company s assumptions regarding projected results depend largely upon the company s ability to retain substantially all of the company s current clients 
retention is affected by several factors including but not limited to the quality of the services provided by the company  the quality and pricing of comparable services offered by competitors  continuity of management and continuity of non management personnel 
there are several major national competitors with resources far greater than those of the company which therefore have the ability to provide service  cost and compensation incentives to clients and employees which could result in the loss of such clients and or employees 
the company s ability to realize its projections will be largely dependent upon its ability to maintain margins  which in turn will be determined in large part by management s control over costs 
to a significant extent  certain costs are not within the control of management and margins may be adversely affected by such items as significant inflation  labor unrest  increased payroll and related costs and year failures by third party vendors 
although management currently has no reasonable basis of information upon which to conclude that any significant service company client or security guard customers will default in payment for the services rendered by the company  any such default by a significant client due to bankruptcy or otherwise  would have a material adverse impact on the company s liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
additional detailed information concerning a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the information contained herein is readily available in the company s most recent reports on forms k  q and k and its current registration statement on form s and any amendments thereto all as filed with the securities and exchange commission from time to time
