year compliance miller is continuing the process of identifying  evaluating  and implementing changes to computer programs necessary to address the year issue 
this issue affects computer systems that have date sensitive programs that may not properly recognize the year systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail  resulting in business interruption 
miller believes its current computer hardware and software programs are year compliant and  therefore  does not believe the cost of converting all internal systems to be year compliant will be material to its consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
costs related to the year issue are being expensed as incurred 
costs incurred to date have been less than  and management does not believe any material additional costs will be incurred

miller currently does not expect remediation costs to be material nor does it expect any significant interruption to its operations because of year problems 
miller s products do not have year readiness issues because they do not contain date sensitive functions 
miller is in the process of contacting all third parties with which it has significant relationships  to determine the extent to which miller could be vulnerable to failure by any of them to obtain year compliance 
some of miller s major suppliers  customers and financial institutions have confirmed that they anticipate being year compliant on or before december   although many have only indicated that they have year readiness programs 
to date  miller is not aware of any significant third parties with a year issue that could materially impact miller s operations  liquidity or capital resources 
however  miller has no means of ensuring that third parties will be year ready and the potential effect of third party non compliance is currently not determinable 
miller will continue to devote the resources necessary to ensure that all year issues are properly addressed 
however  there can be no assurance that all year problems are detected 
further  there can be no assurance that miller s assessment of its third party vendors and suppliers will be accurate 
some of the potential worst case scenarios that could occur include corruption of data in miller s internal systems  failure of infrastructure services provided by government agencies  and health  environmental and safety issues relating to miller s facilities 
if any of these situations were to occur  miller s operations in certain areas could be temporarily interrupted 
miller intends to develop year contingency plans for continuing operations in the event such problems arise 
miller has operations around the country and is considering shifting operations to different facilities if there are interruptions to operations in a particular region
