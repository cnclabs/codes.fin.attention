lee equity fund iv  lp  beacon capital partners  lp and rosen consulting group  entered into a purchase agreement under which the investors will purchase billion of a new series b preferred stock of wyndham 
patriot and wyndham currently plan to use the proceeds from the investment to settle their forward equity contracts  as described above  to repay indebtedness  and for working capital and growth purposes 
wyndham will pay dividends on its series b preferred stock quarterly  on a cumulative basis  at a rate of per year 
for the first six years  dividends will be payable partly in cash and partly in additional shares of preferred stock  with the cash component initially equal to for the first dividend payment and declining over the period to approximately for the final dividend payment 
each share of series b preferred stock may be converted  at the option of its holder  into that number of shares of wyndham common stock equal to divided by the conversion price of the series b preferred stock 
initially the conversion price will be  but is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
restructuring under the terms of the purchase agreement  relating to the billion equity investment  patriot and wyndham are required to complete a restructuring of their existing paired share reit structure prior to the investment 
under the terms of the restructuring  the following events will occur 
a reverse stock split of the common stock of wyndham and patriot 

a wholly owned subsidiary of wyndham will merge with and into patriot with patriot surviving 

the pairing agreement between patriot and wyndham will terminate 

patriot will terminate its status as a real estate investment trust effective january  
the non voting stock of specified corporate subsidiaries held by the patriot partnership will be transferred  and subsequently will be owned directly by patriot and or wyndham  rather than through the patriot partnership 

the third party partners in both the patriot partnership and the wyndham partnership will be offered an opportunity to exchange their limited partner interests for wyndham common stock

redemption option for a period of days following the completion of the billion equity investment  wyndham may redeem up to million of the series b preferred stock at a redemption price of per share of the stated amount plus all accrued dividends 
wyndham currently plans to fund this redemption through the issuance of million of series a preferred stock to its stockholders 
the series a preferred stock has the same economic terms as the series b preferred stock 
liquidity as a condition of the billion equity investment  the companies are required to restructure their existing organization 
as discussed above  the pairing agreement between wyndham and patriot will terminate  patriot s status as a reit will terminate effective january  and patriot will become a taxable corporation at that date 
as a result of that transaction  the company will be required to record a charge for deferred income taxes for the difference between the income tax basis and the recorded carrying value of assets and liabilities 
the company is continuing its analysis of the expected effects of this non cash charge 
currently the estimate is in the range of million  however  this amount could vary when the analysis is completed 
in addition  the company will charge off the value of an intangible asset associated with the paired share structure of approximately million 
in the event that the equity and related debt transaction referred to above are not completed  management has determined that additional capital would have to be raised from other sources or the companies would have to sell significant amounts of assets to produce proceeds sufficient to meet its existing current debt maturity obligations 
these asset sales could include resort properties or wyndham managed properties in major cities and could negatively impact operations 
management believes these alternatives  if necessary  represent a viable plan to address company s liquidity needs 
new debt financing new credit facility 
patriot has recently signed a commitment letter with chase securities inc and the chase manhattan bank for senior credit facilities for wyndham in the amount of billion  comprised of a term loan facility and a revolving loan facility 
definitive agreements relating to the new credit facility are expected to be finalized at the same time that the billion equity investment is consummated 
the chase manhattan bank will act as the administrative agent and chase securities inc will act as the lead arranger for a syndicate of lenders which will provide wyndham with billion in term loans and up to million under the revolving loan facility  of which a maximum of million may be drawn at the closing of the investment 
the term loan facility and the revolving facility carry terms of years and years  respectively 
interest rates for the new credit facility are based upon libor spreads varying from to per annum for the revolving loan facility and to per annum for the term loan facility  based both on wyndham s leverage ratio and on whether any increasing rate loans described below are outstanding 
however  at wyndham s election or under other specified circumstances  the term loans and revolving loans may instead bear interest at an alternative base rate plus the applicable spread 
the alternative base rate is equal to the greater of the chase manhattan bank s prime rate or federal funds rate plus  and the alternative spread is below the applicable libor spread 
subject to limited agreed upon exceptions  the new credit facility will be guaranteed by the domestic subsidiaries of wyndham  and will be secured by pledges of equity interests held by wyndham and its subsidiaries 
the proceeds from the term loan facility will be used to finance the restructuring of wyndham and patriot 
the proceeds from the revolving loan facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
increasing rate loans 
wyndham and patriot have signed a commitment letter with the chase manhattan bank  chase securities inc  bear  stearns co 
inc  and the bear stearns companies inc providing that the chase manhattan bank  the bear  stearns companies inc and a possible syndicate of other lenders will provide an increasing rate loan facility in the amount of up to million 
the irl carries a term of years 
interest rates for the irl are based on libor spreads and are initially set at below the initial libor spread on the term loan facility  but increase by every three months  with a cap of libor plus 
however  under other specified circumstances  interest accrues at an alternate rate equal to the rate borne by three month treasury securities plus  plus the applicable spread 
the lenders under the irl receive the benefit of the same guarantees and pledges of security provided under the new credit facility 
the proceeds from the irl will be used to finance the restructuring of wyndham and patriot 
after the six month anniversary of the closing of the investment  lenders transferring irls may exchange the irls for exchange notes carrying identical terms to the irls 
to the extent any irls or exchange notes are outstanding days after the closing of the investment  wyndham must by such date file and maintain a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission allowing the resale of any exchange notes outstanding thereafter 
wyndham may also offer registered substitute notes in exchange for all outstanding irls and exchange notes 
wyndham s ability to borrow under its revolving facility is subject to wyndham s compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants  including total leverage and interest coverage ratios  limitations on additional indebtedness  and limitations on investments and stockholder dividends 
wyndham and patriot have agreed to pay to the agents and the lenders customary fees for a facility of this nature 
on february   the companies sold million unregistered paired shares to nations  for a purchase price per paired share of  or aggregate consideration of approximately million 
on april   the companies sold million unregistered paired shares to painewebber for a purchase price per paired share of  or aggregate consideration of approximately million 
current business challenges forward equity contracts 
patriot is a party to forward equity contracts with three counterparties involving the sale of an aggregate of million paired shares  with related price adjustment mechanisms 
patriot s aggregate obligation under the forward equity transactions was approximately million at march  as of such date  patriot has delivered an aggregate of million shares to the counterparties as collateral in addition to approximately million paired shares currently owned by the counterparties or their affiliates 
patriot currently intends to settle in full all of the forward transactions with the proceeds of the billion equity investment 
if the forward transactions are settled in cash  the counterparties must deliver to us the companies paired shares then owned or held by them as collateral under the respective forward agreements 
on february   all three counterparties agreed  subject to specified conditions  not to require settlement under their respective forward agreements or to sell paired shares in connection with the forward agreements until the earlier of a the closing of the investment and b june  the agreements provide that the standstill obligations terminate if i the agreement is terminated or the parties publicly announce that they do not intend to close the investment and patriot has not entered into another agreement that provides for a complete settlement of the forward transactions on or before june   ii the default on certain of our covenants under the forward agreements or under our credit facility iii any of the counterparties sells or agrees to sell paired shares  or iv the price of the paired shares falls to a specified threshold  as described below 
any counterparty whose standstill agreement terminates will have the right to require an immediate settlement of its forward equity transaction 
the standstill agreement with painewebber financial products  inc provides that the painewebber standstill obligation will terminate if the closing price of the paired shares on any trading day is less than or equal to 
on march   the closing price of the paired shares was 
as a result  painewebber s standstill obligation has terminated and painewebber is entitled to require settlement under its forward contract 
as of march   painewebber has not indicated that it intends to sell paired shares or require settlement of its forward transaction 
the standstill agreement with nationsbanc mortgage capital corporation provides that the nationsbanc standstill obligation will terminate if the weighted average trading price of the paired shares excluding the last minutes of trading on any trading day is less than or equal to 
the paired share price  as so calculated  has not fallen below this threshold 
the standstill agreement with ubs ag  london branch provides that the ubs standstill obligation will terminate if the paired share price calculated as provided in the ubs forward contract falls below 
the closing price of the paired shares has not been less than 
nations has asserted that its standstill obligation has terminated by virtue of the termination of painewebber s standstill obligation  based upon a most favored counterparty clause in the nations forward contract 
ubs has asserted that its standstill obligation has terminated based upon its interpretation of the measure of the paired share price 
the companies have disputed both the nations and ubs assertions 
as of march   neither nations nor ubs has indicated that it intends to sell paired shares or require settlement of its forward transaction 
the companies may settle the forward transactions by delivering either cash or paired shares if such shares are covered by an effective registration statement 
sources of cash are not currently available for the companies to make the payments that would be required to settle one or more of the forward transactions in cash 
moreover  the companies cannot assure you that our bank lenders would consent to any cash settlements prior to the closing of the transaction 
in addition  given the current market price of the paired shares  any settlement in paired shares would have severely dilutive effects on the companies capital stock 
the dilutive effects increase as the market price of the paired shares decreases below the applicable forward prices 
if any of the counterparties sells paired shares  the conversion price of the preferred stock to be issued to the investors will be adjusted downward to the extent that the price recognized by us on the sale is less than per share 
generally  the companies may settle by delivering paired shares only if a registration statement covering such paired shares is effective 
there are currently effective registration statements covering the sale by the three forward counterparties of up to million paired shares and the sale by ubs of an additional million paired shares in connection with the forward equity transactions 
the companies cannot assure you that these registration statements will remain effective or that the companies will not be required to register more paired shares in connection with the forward equity transactions 
two of the counterparties have requested that the companies register the balance of the paired shares delivered as collateral to all three counterparties 
the companies intend to seek to register all such shares 
agreements relating to existing credit facility 
patriot and wyndham s existing credit facility with the chase manhattan bank  chase securities  inc and painewebber real estate consists of a million revolving credit facility and a series of term loans in the aggregate amount of billion 
interest rates on the existing credit facility are based on patriot s and wyndham s leverage ratio and vary from to over libor 
under the original terms of the credit facility  two of the term loans matured on january  million and march  million  respectively 
all of the requisite lenders under the credit facility have agreed to extend the maturity of these two terms loans to june  if the companies do not consummate the investment by june   or our agreement with the investor group otherwise terminates  the maturity on these two term loans will be extended to march  and the companies will be required to secure the credit facility with mortgages and other security interests by june  the companies have paid fees of approximately million to the lenders under the credit facility in connection with their agreement to extend the maturities of the term loans to june  interstate s third party hotel management business in may   patriot along  with interstate hotels company interstate entered into a settlement agreement as amended  the settlement agreement with marriott international  inc marriott which addressed certain claims asserted by marriott in connection with patriot s then proposed merger with interstate 
the settlement agreement provided for the dismissal of litigation brought by marriott  and allowed patriot s merger with interstate to close 

in addition to dismissal of the marriott litigation  the settlement agreement provides for three principal transactions the companies re branding of ten marriott hotels under the wyndham name  marriott s assumption of the management the assumed management contracts of ten marriott hotels formerly managed by interstate for the remaining term of the marriott franchise agreement  and our divestiture  either through a sale or a spin off of assets  of the third party management business which was operated by interstate the divestiture 

for patriot to sell the third party management business which was operated by interstate to a third party a sale transaction  patriot must sign a non binding letter of intent the letter of intent for the sale transaction on or before march   sign a final binding contract the final binding contract for the sale transaction no later than midnight on april   and consummate the sale transaction no later than june  if patriot does not complete a sale transaction  it must consummate the spin off of the third party management business which was operated by interstate the spin off no later than the earliest of june   april  if patriot does not enter into a letter of intent by march   thirty days after the date marriott disapproves the letter of intent  may  if patriot does not enter into a final binding contract by april   or thirty days after the date of marriott disapproves of the final binding contract 
the last date on which either the sale transaction or the spin off may be complete pursuant to the settlement agreement is the final divestiture date 
if the companies do not complete the spin off or the sale transaction by the final divestiture date  marriott will be entitled to receive of the fees otherwise due under the assumed management contracts 
we will also be subject to additional penalties including marriott s right to purchase  subject to third party consents  the hotels to be submanaged by marriott and six additional marriott hotels owned by patriot at their then appraised values 
moreover  subject to any defenses the companies may have  we would owe marriott liquidated damages with respect to the hotels converted to the wyndham brand  those to be submanaged by marriott  and the six additional marriott hotels marriott would have the option to purchase 
the companies also anticipate that marriott would require third party owners of marriott branded hotels that wyndham manages to replace wyndham as manager of their hotels 
as a result  each respective hotel would either lose the marriott brand  at which time the companies would have to compensate marriott for any lost franchise fees or terminate the management contract with us and enter into a contract with another manager 
the companies would owe liquidated damages on any third party marriott franchised hotel which chooses to convert its brand 
as of march   the companies had approximately million outstanding under the credit facility and billion outstanding on the term loans 
additionally  the companies had outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
as of march   patriot also had over million of mortgage debt outstanding that encumbered hotels and hotels under development and approximately million in other debt  resulting in total indebtedness of approximately billion 
as of march   the companies had no additional availability under the credit facility 
renovations and capital improvements during  the companies completed approximately million in total capital improvements and renovations on various hotel properties  including i costs related to converting hotels to one of the companies proprietary brands  ii costs related to recurring maintenance capital expenditures iii costs related to enhancing the revenue producing capabilities of its hotels 
approximately million of the total capital costs related to hotels that were converted to proprietary brands in these major renovations included upgrading the quality of the furniture and fixtures in guest rooms  public meeting space and lobby areas as well as adding additional rooms to certain of the hotels 
patriot completed over million of capital improvements and renovations during during  approximately million of total capital improvement expenditures were related to significant renovations at certain of the hotel properties 
pursuant to the participating leases  patriot is obligated to establish a reserve for each hotel for capital improvements  including the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment f f e 
management reserves an average of of total hotel revenues and believes such amounts are sufficient to fund recurring capital expenditures for the hotels 
capital expenditures  exclusive of renovations  may exceed of total revenues in a single year 
the companies attempt to schedule renovations and improvements during traditionally lower occupancy periods in an effort to minimize disruption to the hotel s operations 
therefore  management does not believe such renovations and capital improvements will have a material effect on the results of operations of the hotels 
capital expenditures will be financed through the capital expenditure reserves  the credit facility  other financing sources  or with working capital 
legislation affecting the paired share structure patriot s ability to qualify as a reit is dependent upon its continued exemption from the anti pairing rules of section b a of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
section b a of the code would ordinarily prevent a corporation from qualifying as a reit if its stock is paired with the stock of a corporation whose activities are inconsistent with reit status  such as wyndham 
the grandfathering rules governing section b generally provide  however  that section b a does not apply to a paired reit if the reit and its paired operating company were paired on june  there are  however  no judicial or administrative authorities interpreting this grandfathering rule in the context of a merger into a grandfathered reit or otherwise 
moreover  although patriot s and wyndham s respective predecessors  cal jockey and bay meadows  were paired on june   if for any reason cal jockey failed to qualify as a reit in the benefit of the grand fathering rule would not be available to patriot and patriot would not qualify as a reit for any taxable year 
patriot s exemption from the anti pairing rules could be lost  or its ability to utilize the paired structure could be revoked or limited  as a result of future legislation 
in this regard  legislation to freeze the grandfathered status of paired share reits such as patriot was included in the internal revenue service restructuring and reform act of the irs reform act of  which was signed into law by the president on july  under the irs reform act of  the anti pairing rules generally apply to real property interests acquired after march  by patriot and wyndham  or a subsidiary or partnership in which a or greater interest is owned by patriot or wyndham collectively  the reit group  unless i the real property interests are acquired pursuant to a written agreement which is binding on march  and all times thereafter or ii the acquisition of such real property interests were described in a public announcement or in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on or before march  in addition  the grandfathered status of any property under the foregoing rules will be lost if the rent on a lease entered into or renewed after march   with respect to such property exceeds an arm s length rate 
the irs reform act of also provides that a property held by patriot or wyndham that is not subject to the anti pairing rules would become subject to such rules in the event of an improvement placed in service after december  that changes the use of the property and the cost of which is greater than percent of x the undepreciated cost of the property prior to the improvement or y in the case of property acquired where there is a substituted basis  the fair market value of the property on the day it was acquired by patriot and wyndham 
there is an exception for improvements placed in service before january  pursuant to a binding contract in effect as of december  and at all times thereafter 
the irs reform act of generally permits patriot to continue its current method of operations with respect to its existing assets  including the assets acquired in the interstate merger  the arcadian acquisition  the summerfield acquisition and the chci merger 
however  the legislation would require patriot to modify its method of operations with respect to newly acquired assets 
year compliance many computer systems were not designed to interpret any dates beyond  which could lead to business disruptions in the united states and internationally the year issue 
the companies recognize the importance of minimizing the number and seriousness of any disruptions that may occur as a result of year and have adopted an extensive compliance program 
the companies compliance program involves three major program areas 
corporate information technology infrastructure and reservation systems 
other electronic assets such as  but not limited to  automated time clocks  point of sale systems  non information technology systems  including embedded technologies that operate fire life safety systems  phone systems  energy management systems and other similar systems 
third parties with whom the companies conduct business the companies are applying a three phase approach to each program area 
inventory phase identify systems and third parties that may be affected by year issues 
assessment phase prioritize the inventoried systems and third parties  assess their year readiness  plan corrective actions 
remediation phase implement corrective actions  verify implementation  formulate contingency plans the companies engaged a consulting firm to conduct the inventory and assessment phases of the compliance program 
the companies have completed inventory and assessment phases with respect to their corporate information technology infrastructure and reservation systems 
the companies have also completed the inventory and assessment phases with respect to the information technology and other electronic assets that are located in the companies hotels  other than some of the hotels which are either managed by wyndham but not owned by patriot or owned by patriot but not leased or operated by wyndham the third party compliance hotels 
based on those assessments  the companies  working with their consultants  determined which systems were not year compliant and developed appropriate remediation plans 
the companies have begun the necessary work to remediate those systems at their owned and leased hotels  and have completed percent of that work 
the companies previously engaged a consulting firm to provide the support and additional skills to effect the necessary remediation in sufficient time for testing and any necessary modifications 
of the third party compliance hotels that were not acquired in the merger with interstate hotels the interstate merger  third party compliance hotels have been assessed as part of the companies compliance program and the companies have begun to implement remediation plans at of those hotels 
the owners of the other third party compliance hotels that were assessed have to date neither taken any action to effect the necessary remediation identified in the assessment nor authorized the companies to effect the remediation on behalf of the owners 
while none of the remaining third party compliance hotels have been assessed by the companies  of the owners have informed the companies that the owners completed their own assessments 
the companies are continuing to monitor the status of the third party compliance hotels and have reminded the owners of the importance of making the third party compliance hotels year compliant in sufficient time to permit adequate testing 
the companies have begun surveying the year compliance of the owners of the hotels that are franchised under the wyndham brand but not managed by wyndham  and have informed those owners of the appropriate standards to make the equipment operating wyndham s systems year compliant 
however  as the systems at the third party compliance hotels and franchised hotels are not under the companies control  the companies will be required to rely on the information provided by those owners or managers operators and will not be able to test the assessment or remediation effected by third parties at the third party compliance hotels or the franchised hotels 
the companies presently expect to expend approximately million in connection with year issues 
to date  the companies have incurred million in connection with the inventory and assessment phases of their compliance program and million to remediate their systems 
however  the companies anticipated expenditures may increase as the companies effect the remediation plans 
as part of the settlement of litigation arising out of the interstate merger  the companies agreed to contribute to a new company management of the third party compliance hotels acquired in that merger  and then dispose of substantially all of that new company s stock by means of a spin off to the companies shareholders or otherwise 
as the hotels acquired in the interstate merger whose management will be contributed to the new company are owned by third parties  the companies expect those owners to bear all costs related to the inventory  assessment and remediation of those hotels 
the companies have identified the vendors and service providers that are critical to the companies businesses and have requested those parties to provide information concerning their year compliance and remediation efforts 
the companies are now seeking additional information from those parties that did not respond or did not provide sufficient information  but cannot guarantee that all vendors or service providers will comply with the companies requests 
more importantly  the companies must rely on the information provided by the third parties and will not be able to test the third parties compliance 
as a result  the companies may not be able to accurately determine the year compliance of those vendors or service providers 
based on preliminary responses  the companies believe that their most critical vendors and service providers will not cause the companies operations to be materially disrupted as a result of year issues 
during  the companies intend to determine the extent to which they will be able to replace vendors and service providers that are expected to be non compliant 
due to the lack of an alternative source  there may be instances in which the companies will have no alternative but to remain with non compliant vendors or service providers 
as the companies identify the non compliant vendors and service providers  they will then determine appropriate contingency plans 
the companies believe that their current compliance program will allow them sufficient time to identify which of their systems and other electronic assets are not year compliant and to effect the necessary remediation to avoid substantial problems arising from year induced failures 
the companies believe that their reprogramming  upgrading and systems replacements will be implemented by the end of the third quarter of the companies believe that this should provide adequate time to further correct any problems that did not surface during the implementation and testing for those systems 
notwithstanding that  the companies do recognize that some vendors and the owners and managers operators of the third party compliance hotels may not comply with their present schedules and could affect the companies timing and remediation efforts generally 
if the companies are not successful in implementing their year compliance plan  the companies may suffer a material adverse impact on their consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to those systems within the companies control and the control of its vendors and suppliers  there are other systems that could have an impact on the companies businesses and which may not be year compliant by january  these systems could affect the operations of the air traffic control system and airlines or other segments of the lodging and travel industries  or the economy and travel generally 
in addition  these systems could affect the third party compliance hotels or the hotels franchised under the companies brands whose owners and managers operators are implementing their own compliance programs 
these systems are outside of the companies control or influence and their compliance may not be verified by the companies 
however  these systems could adversely affect the companies financial condition or results of operation 
during the second quarter of  the companies intend to develop contingency plans to address potential year induced failures 
because the companies have no control over third party assessment and remediation efforts  the companies expect to focus most of their contingency planning on externally caused disruptions 
in addition  the companies will develop their plans on their belief that the consequences of year induced failures will be local in nature 
these plans will be based on existing contingency plans for operations during storms and other natural disasters 
while each hotel will develop a contingency plan  any disruption in utilities or other key local services could have the effect of disrupting operations of several hotels located in the affected geographic area 
as part of the companies contingency planning  they also expect to evaluate their continued management of the third party compliance hotels that do not become year compliant 
inflation operators of hotels in general possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit wyndham s and the lessees ability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
revenues for certain of patriot s hotels are greater in the first and second quarters of a calendar year and at other hotels in the second and third quarters of a calendar year 
seasonal variations in revenue at the hotels may cause quarterly fluctuations in the patriot companies revenues 
hotel industry risks operating risks the companies primary business is buying  selling  leasing and managing hotels 
patriot leases its hotels to wyndham and to third party lessees the lessees pursuant to separate participating leases the participating leases 
consequently  patriot is dependent on the ability of wyndham  the lessees and the hotel management entities that manage the hotels the operators to manage the operations of the hotels that are leased to or operated by them 
the companies business is subject to operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include  among other things  competition for guests from other hotels  a number of which may have greater marketing and financial resources and experience than the companies do  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors  which increases may not have been offset in past years  and may not be offset in future years  by increased room rates  dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism  which business may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs and other expenses of travel  which may deter travelers and adverse effects of general and local economic conditions 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of wyndham and the lessees to generate revenues 
the companies are also subject to the risk that in connection with the acquisition of hotels and hotel operating companies it may not be possible to transfer certain operating licenses  such as food and beverage licenses  to the lessees  the operators or wyndham  or to obtain new licenses in a timely manner in the event such licenses cannot be transferred 
although hotels can provide alcoholic beverages under interim licenses or licenses obtained prior to the acquisition of these hotels  there can be no assurance that these licenses will remain in effect until patriot or wyndham obtains new licenses or that new licenses will be obtained 
the failure to have alcoholic beverages licenses or other operating licenses could adversely affect the ability of the affected lessees  and operators or wyndham to generate revenues 
operating costs and capital expenditures  hotel renovation hotels  in general  have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements  particularly in older structures  including periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment f f e 
under the terms of the participating leases  patriot is obligated to establish a reserve to pay the cost of certain capital expenditures at its hotel and pay for periodic replacement or refurbishment of f f e 
if capital expenditures exceed patriot s expectations  the additional cost could have an adverse effect on patriot s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  patriot may acquire hotels where significant renovation is either required or desirable 
renovation of hotels involves certain risks  including the possibility of environmental problems  construction cost overruns and delays  uncertainties as to market demand or deterioration in market demand after commencement of renovation and the emergence of unanticipated competition from other hotels 
competition for hotel acquisition opportunities the companies may be competing for investment opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources 
these entities may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage  including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a hotel operator or the geographic proximity of its investments 
competition may generally reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell 
seasonality the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
revenues at certain hotels are greater in the first and second quarters of a calendar year and at other hotels in the second and third quarters of a calendar year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels may cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
real estate investment risks general risks the companies investments will be subject to varying degrees of risk generally incidental to the ownership of real property 
the underlying value of patriot s real estate investments and its income will be dependent upon the ability of the lessees  the operators and wyndham to operate patriot s hotels in a manner sufficient to maintain or increase revenues and to generate sufficient income in excess of operating expenses to make rent payments under their leases with patriot 
income from patriot s hotels may be adversely affected by changes in national economic conditions  changes in local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of mortgage funds  the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  changes in real estate tax rates and other operating expenses  adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies  adverse changes in zoning laws  civil unrest  acts of god  including earthquakes and other natural disasters which may result in uninsured losses  acts of war and other factors which are beyond our control 
value and illiquidity of real estate real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
the companies ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions is limited 
if the companies must sell an investment  there can be no assurance that the companies will be able to dispose of it in the time period desired or that the sales price of any investment will equal or exceed the amount of our investment 
property taxes the companies hotels are subject to real property taxes 
the real property taxes on the companies hotel properties may increase or decrease as property tax rates change and as the value of the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities 
if property taxes increase  the companies financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
consents of ground lessor required for sale of certain hotels certain of the companies hotels are subject to ground leases with third party lessors 
in addition  the companies may acquire hotels in the future that are subject to ground leases 
any proposed sale by the companies of a property that is subject to a ground lease or any proposed assignment of the companies leasehold interest in the ground lease may require the consent of third party lessors 
as a result  the companies may not be able to sell  assign  transfer or convey the companies interest in any such property in the future absent the consent of such third parties 
environmental matters the companies operating costs may be affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  as well as the cost of complying with future legislation 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in such property 
such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to remediate such property properly  may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow by using such real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the transportation  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is or ever was owned or operated by such person 
certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials  including asbestos containing materials acms  into the environment  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released acms or other hazardous materials 
environmental laws may also impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or transferred or in which businesses may be operated  and these restrictions may require expenditures 
in connection with the ownership and operation of any of our hotels  we may be potentially liable for any such costs 
the cost of defending against claims of liability or remediating contaminated property and the cost of complying with environmental laws could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
phase i environmental site assessments esas have been conducted at substantially all of our hotels by qualified independent environmental engineers 
the purpose of phase i esas is to identify potential sources of contamination for which any of our hotels may be responsible and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance 
the esas have not revealed any environmental liability or compliance concerns that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets  results of operations or liquidity  nor are we aware of any such liability or concerns 
nevertheless  it is possible that these esas did not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns or that material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns exist of which we are currently unaware 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority  and have no other knowledge of  any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental substances in connection with any of the hotels 
uninsured and underinsured losses each of the participating leases specifies comprehensive insurance to be maintained on each of the applicable leased hotels  including liability  fire and extended coverage 
the companies believe such specified coverage is of the type and amount customarily obtained for or by an owner of hotels 
leases for subsequently acquired hotels will contain similar provisions 
however  there are certain types of losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as earthquakes and floods  that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
the companies will use discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage on the companies investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms 
this may result in insurance coverage that  in the event of a substantial loss  would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed 
under such circumstances  the insurance proceeds received by us might not be adequate to restore the companies economic position with respect to such property 
acquisition and development risks the companies currently intend to pursue acquisitions of additional hotels and  under appropriate circumstances  may pursue development opportunities 
acquisitions entail risks that such acquired hotels will fail to perform in accordance with expectations and that estimates of the cost of improvements necessary to market  acquire and operate properties will prove inaccurate as well as general risks associated with any new real estate acquisition 
in addition  hotel development is subject to numerous risks  including risks of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs  new project commencement risks such as receipt of zoning  occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits and the incurrence of development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion 
dependence on management contracts management contracts are acquired  terminated  renegotiated or converted to franchise agreements in the ordinary course of our business 
these management contracts generally may be terminated by the owner of the hotel property if the hotel manager fails to meet certain performance standards  if the property is sold to a third party  if the property owner defaults on indebtedness encumbering the property and or upon a foreclosure of the property 
other grounds for termination of our upscale hotel management contracts include a hotel owner s election to close a hotel and  in the case of the wyndham anatole  dallas  texas  if james carreker ceases to be chairman and chief executive officer of patriot and wyndham 
the companies can make no assurances that the companies will be able to replace terminated management contracts  or that the terms of renegotiated or converted contracts will be as favorable as the terms that existed before such renegotiation or conversion 
the companies are also subject to the risk of deterioration in the financial condition of a hotel owner and such owner s ability to pay management fees to the companies 
in addition  in certain circumstances  the companies may be required to make loans to or capital investments or advances in hotel properties in connection with management contracts 
a material deterioration in the operating results of one or more of these hotel properties and or a loss of the related management contracts could adversely affect the value of our investment in such hotel properties 
risks relating to gaming operations regulation of gaming operations we own and operate several casino gaming facilities at certain of our hotels  including el san juan  el conquistador  condado plaza and old san juan in puerto rico 
each of these gaming operations is subject to extensive licensing  permitting and regulatory requirements administered by various governmental entities 
typically  gaming regulatory authorities have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming operations 
they may revoke  suspend  condition or limit our gaming approvals and licenses  impose substantial fines and take other actions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our hotel casinos 
our directors  officers and some key employees  are subject to licensing or suitability determinations by various gaming authorities 
if any of those gaming authorities were to find someone unsuitable  we would have to sever our relationship with that person 
risks associated with high end gaming the high end gaming business is more volatile than other forms of gaming 
variability in high end gaming could have a positive or negative impact on cash flow  earnings and other financial measures in any given quarter 
in addition  a portion of our table gaming is attributable to the play of a relatively small number of international customers 
the loss of  or a reduction in play of  the most significant of such customers could have an effect on our future operating results
