over the years  the company has decreased its holdings in marketable securities and focused its resources in its oil gas and real estate divisions 
general oil and gas the company s oil and gas operating performance is influenced by several factors 
the most significant are the prices received for the sale of oil and gas and the sales volume 
for  the average price of oil that the company received was compared to for  a price decrease of 
average gas prices received by the company in were lower than average gas prices 
the average price of gas for was compared to for the following table reflects the average prices received by the company for oil and gas  the average production cost per boe  and the amount of the company s oil and gas production for the fiscal years presented fiscal year ended december crude oil and natural gas production oil bbls    gas mcf    average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf average production costs per boe sales prices received by the company for oil and gas have fluctuated significantly from period to period 
the fluctuations in oil prices during these periods primarily reflected market uncertainty regarding the inability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to control the production of its member countries  as well as concerns related to global supply and demand for crude oil 
gas prices received by the company fluctuate generally with changes in the spot market price for gas 
it is impossible to predict future price movements with certainty 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income for the year ended december was  in as compared to  in oil and gas revenues decreased from  in to  in this decrease was attributable to sharp declines in the price of crude oil in average crude oil prices in were approximately lower in than real estate revenues increased from  in to  in this increase was principally due to higher rents and the operations of the properties acquired in and during the fourth quarter of oil and gas production expense was comparable in and oil and gas production expense amounted to  in and  in depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas assets amounted to  in compared to  in also  the company additionally provided a depreciation  depletion and amortization ceiling charge of  in to reflect the substantial declines in the price of crude oil

the current ratio at december  was to on a market basis  which management considers adequate for the company s current business 
the company s working capital was approximately million at december  the company anticipates that cash provided by operating activities and investing activities will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements to acquire oil and gas properties and to drill and evaluate these and other oil and gas properties presently held by the company 
the level of oil and gas capital expenditures will vary in future periods depending on market conditions  including the price of oil and the demand for natural gas  and other related factors 
as the company has no material long term commitments with respect to its oil and gas capital expenditure plans  the company has a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of its expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the company plans to actively continue its exploration and production activities as well as search for the acquisition of oil and gas producing properties and of companies with desirable oil and gas producing properties 
there can be no assurance that the company will in fact locate any such acquisitions 
during the year ended december   the company acquired five real estate properties  four of which were acquired from the trust company of new jersey tcnj at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
these transactions were financed with first mortgage loans from tcnj 
the company will explore other real estate acquisitions as they arise 
the timing of any such acquisition will depend on  among other things  economic conditions and the favorable evaluation of specific opportunities presented to the company 
the company is currently planning further acquisitions of investment properties during the next year 
accordingly  while the company anticipates that it will actively explore these and other real estate acquisition opportunities  no assurance can be given that any such acquisition will occur

the company believes it has adequate capital resources to fund operations for the foreseeable future 
year compliance many businesses and government organizations use computers and other electronic equipment that read and process dates 
this equipment falls into two categories information technology it  such as ordinary computers and non it equipment  such as process controllers and devices with embedded microprocessors 
some it and non it equipment currently in use cannot accurately read and process certain dates  including several dates in the year and or all dates in the year and afterwards collectively  year problem 
the company has implemented a formal year program the year program to address its year problem and to investigate the year problem of third parties significant to the company s business 
the company s year program has three general components i addressing year problems in the company s it and non it equipment  ii investigating the year problems of such significant third parties  and iii contingency planning 
the company has evaluated its current systems with respect to oil and gas operations and management feels that it is year compliant 
with respect to real estate  management is in the process of evaluating its systems and also believes the current systems are year compliant 
with respect to its non it equipment  the company and its consultants are presently inventorying  evaluating  remediating and testing this equipment 
the company expects to complete its year program for it and non it equipment by mid the company is also requesting information on the year problems of third parties significant to the company s business  including banks  major suppliers and customers 
the company has received and is evaluating the responses from many of these entities and is in the process of requesting more information as appropriate 
based on these responses  the company s obligations to its customers  and the information gathered from its year program  the company is developing contingency plans to minimize the impact of year problems on its business should any such problems occur 
the company expects to substantially complete its investigation of the year problems of its major suppliers  third party service providers and customers and form contingency plans by mid  but also expects that these activities will continue through as more information becomes available to the company 
the company has incurred costs of approximately  in connection with evaluating year compliance of its it systems 
the company does not believe that the costs of its year program will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
costs incurred in connection with evaluating year compliance of its non it systems have not been material to date 
the company does not believe that future costs  if any  of addressing the year problems of its non it systems will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company also intends to continue to use its personnel in evaluating the year problems of those third parties who the company believes are significant to the company s business  including its suppliers  third party service providers and customers  and to formulate contingency plans 
the company expects that the source of any funds that may be necessary to pay the costs of addressing its year problems will be provided from cash balances or cash generated from operations 
the company intends to charge such costs against earnings as the costs are incurred 
management believes that it has taken reasonable steps to address its year problems and to evaluate the year compliance status of key third parties with whom the company does business 
notwithstanding these actions  however  the company cannot ensure that all of its year problems or those of its key suppliers  service providers or customers will be resolved or addressed satisfactorily before the year commences 
management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario could involve the failure of such third parties to address their year problems 
if the company s key suppliers  service providers  customers and other third parties fail to address their year problems  and there are no alternates available to the company  then the company s usual channels of supply and distribution would be disrupted  in which event the company could experience a material adverse impact on its business  results of operations or financial condition

 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities 
the sec defines proved oil and gas reserves as those estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are those that can be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods

future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements 
estimated future development and production costs are determined by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year  based on year end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
estimated future income tax expenses are calculated by applying year end statutory tax rates adjusted for permanent differences and tax credits to estimated future pretax net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves  less the tax basis of the properties involved 
these estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with requirements of the financial accounting standards board and the sec 
due to unpredictable variances in expenses and capital forecasts  crude oil and natural gas price changes and the fact that the basis for such estimates vary significantly  management believes the usefulness of these projections is limited 
estimates of future net cash flows do not represent management s assessment of future profitability or future cash flow to the company 
management s investment and operating decisions are based upon reserve estimates that include proved reserves prescribed by the sec as well as probable reserves  and upon different price and cost assumptions from those used here 
it should be recognized that applying current costs and prices at a percent standard discount rate allows for comparability but does not convey absolute value 
the discounted amounts arrived at are only one measure of financial quantification of proved reserves 
there were no oil and gas estimates filed with or included in reports to any other federal or foreign governmental authority or agency within the last twelve months 
reserves in the united states were estimated by ramsey engineering inc and the company 
reserves in canada were estimated by citidal engineering  ltd 
total costs both capitalized and expensed  incurred in oil and gas producing activities including capitalized interest  cost incurred in property acquisition  exploration and development activities and results of operations from oil and gas producing activities during the three years ended december   and are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  presented elsewhere herein
