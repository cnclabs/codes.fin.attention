part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation timet or the company is one of the world s leading integrated producers of titanium sponge  ingot  slab and mill products and has the largest sales volume worldwide 
the company is the only integrated producer with major manufacturing facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
the company estimates that in it accounted for approximately of worldwide industry shipments of mill products and approximately of world sponge production 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications in which these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium and were approximately half of industry mill product shipments in  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical and industrial power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in diverse new and emerging uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor and automotive uses 
timet s products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet  and strip  extrusions and wire 
the company believes it is among the lowest cost producers of titanium sponge and melt products due in part to its economies of scale  manufacturing expertise and investment in technology 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers which  like the company  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
the company believes that at least of the world s titanium sponge is produced by six companies 
the company intends to continue its focus on the following goals and objectives to change the traditional way business is conducted 
maximize the long term value of its core aerospace business by focusing on the company s basic strengths of sponge production  melting and forging of various shapes of titanium products  and by entering into strategic agreements with major titanium users to help mitigate the cyclicality of the company s aerospace business 

invest in strategic alliances  including joint ventures  acquisitions and entrepreneurial arrangements  as well as new markets  applications and products  to help reduce traditional dependence on the aerospace sector 

invest in technology  capacity and innovative projects aimed at reducing costs and enhancing productivity  quality  customer service and production capabilities 

stabilize the cost and supply of raw materials 

maintain a strong balance sheet 
outlook for the business environment in which timet finds itself in is substantially different from the market for titanium metal 
throughout  and much of  the company was producing titanium ingot and mill products for aerospace customers in contemplation of continuing record jet aircraft build rates that were expected to last through at least during the second half of it became evident that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached  and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive widebody planes 
as aerospace customers continue to reduce inventories during and adjust to decreases in overall production rates  timet faces a decrease in demand from levels 
adding to the challenges in the aerospace sector  industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to the weakness in asian and other economies 
this has led to significant declines in volume and pricing 
these declines in timet s key markets occurred earlier than had been anticipated and at a time when the company was in the midst of a large capital expenditure program to modernize operations and to provide lower cost  more efficient capacity to meet peak demand for its products 
the company was also in the middle of installing enterprise wide systems and software in order to standardize systems and information  improve efficiencies  reduce costs and also to help make its systems year yk ready 
assuming demand remains at currently expected levels and does not decrease or increase significantly in  the company currently expects net losses in at least the first two quarters and a return to modest profitability in the third or fourth quarter 
in both the aerospace and industrial sectors  reduced demand and lower prices including prices under new long term contracts referred to below will cause lower sales and gross profit margins 
on the expense side  timet s costs related to the new enterprise wide system and yk compliance program will continue to run at high levels throughout at the same time  the benefits of the new system will likely be modest in  particularly with the reduction in capacity utilization 
in the fourth quarter of  timet began implementing a plan of action designed to address current market conditions without abandoning key elements of its long term strategy  which it believes remain sound 
the action plan entails the following 
timet has permanently closed manufacturing facilities in verdi  nv  milbury  ma and pomona  ca 
the company has also temporarily or permanently closed parts of facilities in henderson  nv  morgantown  pa and witton  england 

timet has planned workforce reductions of approximately people in the united states and europe 
these reductions represent over of its mid worldwide workforce and have occurred at all levels of the company 
approximately two thirds of the reductions have been implemented as of february 
timet has merged all of its north american manufacturing operations into one operating unit to reduce costs and  at the same time  improve customer service 

reductions in plant overhead costs as well as in selling and administrative costs have been targeted 

supply contracts with key vendors have been renegotiated in order to reduce volumes and  to some extent  prices 

capital expenditures will be substantially cut back with exceptions of expenditure for environmental and safety purposes and funds needed to complete carryover projects begun in  including the capital needed to complete implementation of the company s business enterprise wide software system 
total capital expenditures are expected to be less than million in  compared to an aggregate of approximately million in and for the year  capital expenditures should decline further 

plans are already in place to reduce working capital  especially inventory and receivables  and the company believes it will see the benefits of this program beginning in the first quarter of 
the company has also obtained the agreement of nippon mining metals company and mitsui company incorporated to defer indefinitely timet s plan to purchase approximately of the outstanding stock of toho titanium company  ltd 
from nippon mining metals and mitsui at a purchase price of approximately million 
timet plans to proceed with the other elements of the previously announced strategic alliance between toho and timet  including study of the possible formation of a titanium hearth melting joint venture in japan and an anticipated long term agreement for the purchase of certain grades of titanium sponge by timet from toho 
in addition to its short term plan of actions as described above  the company has long term agreements with certain major aerospace customers  including the boeing company  rolls royce plc  united technologies corporation and related companies and wyman gordon company 
these agreements provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements generally at least for extended periods nine to ten years and ii fixed or formula determined prices generally for at least the first five years 
these contracts are structured to provide incentives to both parties to lower timet s costs and share in the savings 
these contracts and others represent the core of the company s long term aerospace strategy and in and beyond are anticipated to account for more than of aerospace revenues 
these agreements should limit pricing volatility both up and down  for the long term benefit of both parties  while providing timet with a solid base of aerospace volume 
as a complement to the long term agreements entered into with the company s key customers  the company has also entered into agreements with certain key suppliers that were intended to assure anticipated raw material needs to satisfy production requirements for the company s key customers 
when the order flow did not meet expectations in  the company sought to restructure the terms of certain agreements 
the company is continuing to work with suppliers and believes that the contracts can be amended or terminated without any material adverse effect to the company 
with the new enterprise wide information system in place  and the assured minimum volume shares and prices of the aerospace contracts referred to above  the company can focus on cost reduction programs to increase timet s profitability to acceptable levels 
acquisitions and capital transactions during the past three years 
at the beginning of  the company was owned by tremont corporation and its operations were conducted primarily in the united states 
during  the company expanded both geographically and operationally as a result of the acquisition of the titanium business of imi plc the imi titanium acquisition  the acquisition of certain assets from axel johnson metals  inc the ajm acquisition and certain smaller acquisitions in europe  all of which acquisitions are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also significantly improved its liquidity and capital structure during through its initial public offering of common stock and the issuance of company obligated manditorily redeemable preferred securities the convertible preferred securities through a subsidiary trust  timet capital trust i 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the company entered into a welded tube joint venture valtimet and in a castings joint venture wyman gordon titanium castings  both intended to combine best manufacturing practices and market coverage in these smaller markets 
in  timet acquired loterios spa to increase market share in industrial markets  particularly oil and gas  and provide increased geographic sales coverage in europe 
these transactions are more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
timet s strategy for investing in new markets and uses for titanium also includes investing in emerging businesses 
in this regard  during the company acquired equity interests in ti 
pro  llc  titanium memory systems  inc tms and ticomp  inc ti 
pro s focus is on developing the market for titanium in automobile racing and other specialty vehicle applications 
tms is continuing its development and production of a titanium substrate for use in computer hard disk drives 
ticomp is working on the development and production of layered titanium and composite materials for a variety of potential applications 
tremont now holds approximately of timet s outstanding common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent industry conditions 
the titanium industry historically has derived the majority of its business from the aerospace industry 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry has been the principal cause of the historical fluctuations in performance of titanium companies  which had cyclical peaks in mill products shipments in  and and cyclical lows in and during the period  the company reported aggregate net income of million  which substantially more than offset the aggregate net losses of million it reported during the difficult period 
worldwide industry mill product shipments of approximately  metric tons in were above levels 
in  industry mill product shipments declined approximately  to approximately  metric tons  with a further decline  to approximately  metric tons  expected in the company believes that the reduction in demand for aerospace products is attributable to a decline in the number of aircraft forecast to be produced  particularly in titanium intensive wide body planes  compounded by reductions in inventories as customers adjust to the decreases in overall production rates 
industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to weakness in asian and other economies 
aerospace demand for titanium products  which includes both jet engine components such as rotor blades  discs  rings and engine cases  and air frame components  such as bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear and wing supports  can be broken down into commercial and military sectors 
industry shipments to the commercial aerospace sector in accounted for approximately of total aerospace demand of total titanium demand 
according to the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  the commercial airline industry reported operating income of over billion estimated in  compared to billion in and billion in the company understands commercial aircraft deliveries are expected to peak in current expected deliveries for and  while below the record levels of and  are still high by historical standards  and the current generations of airplanes use substantially more titanium than their predecessors 
the company can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will result in demand for titanium products 
since titanium s initial applications in the aerospace sector  the number of end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
existing industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  industrial power plants  desalination plants  and pollution control equipment 
titanium is also experiencing increased customer demand in new and emerging uses such as medical implants  sporting equipment  offshore oil and gas production installations  geothermal facilities  military armor and automotive uses 
several of these emerging applications represent potential growth opportunities that the company believes may reduce the industry s historical dependence on the aerospace market 
products and operations 
the company is a vertically integrated titanium producer whose products include titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in processed titanium products  titanium ingot and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various other alloying elements  and forged and rolled products produced from ingot or slab  including billet  bar  flat products plate  sheet  and strip and extrusions 
in  approximately of the company s sales were generated by the company s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment 
the titanium product chain is described below 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in sponge production involves the chlorination of titanium containing rutile ores  derived from beach sand  with chlorine and coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
the company s titanium sponge production capacity in henderson  nv  incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the reactor mass into the condensing vessel 
the titanium mass is then mechanically pushed out of the original reactor  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingots and slabs are solid shapes cylindrical and rectangular  respectively that weigh up to metric tons in the case of ingots and up to metric tons in the case of slabs 
each is formed by melting titanium sponge or scrap or both  usually with various other alloying elements such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
titanium scrap is a by product of milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for most finished titanium products 
the melting process for ingots and slabs is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and meet customer specifications 
ingots and slabs are both sold to customers and further processed into mill products 
titanium mill products result from the forging  rolling  drawing and or extrusion of titanium ingots or slabs into products of various sizes and grades 
these mill products include titanium billet  bar  rod  plate  sheet  strip and extrusions 
the company sends certain products to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers or to the company s service centers 
the company s customers usually process the company s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of products  the company performs extensive testing on its products  including sponge  ingot and mill products 
testing may involve chemical analysis  mechanical testing and ultrasonic and x ray testing 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that the company s products meet the high quality requirements of customers  particularly in aerospace components production 
the company is dependent upon the services of outside processors to perform important processing functions with respect to certain of its products 
in particular  the company currently relies upon a single processor to perform certain rolling steps with respect to some of its plate  sheet and strip products  and upon a single processor to perform certain finishing and conditioning steps with respect to its slab products 
although the company believes that there are other metal producers with the capability to perform these same processing functions  arranging for alternative processors  or possibly acquiring or installing comparable capabilities  could take several months and any interruption in these functions could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in the short term 
the company is exploring ways to lessen its dependence on any individual processor 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloying materials 
the company processes rutile ore into titanium tetrachloride and further processes the titanium tetrachloride into titanium sponge 
while the company is one of six major worldwide producers of titanium sponge  it cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a portion of its sponge needs 
the company expects to provide approximately of its sponge needs from suppliers in japan and the former soviet union fsu 
timet has a long term agreement  concluded in  for the purchase of titanium sponge produced in kazakhstan to support demand for both aerospace and non aerospace applications 
this sponge purchase agreement is for ten years  with firm pricing for the first five years subject to certain possible adjustments 
this contract provides for annual purchases by the company of  to  metric tons 
the parties have agreed in principle to a reduced minimum for  and the company currently expects to do the same for the company also has agreed in principle to purchase on a long term basis premium quality sponge produced in japan primarily to support production of material for critical rotating jet engine applications 
the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
titanium containing rutile ore is currently available from a number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  africa south africa and sierra leone  india and the united states 
a majority of the company s supply of rutile ore is currently purchased from australian suppliers 
the company believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its raw material supplies  although political or economic instability in the countries from which the company purchases its raw materials could materially and adversely affect availability 
in addition  although the company believes that the availability of rutile ore is adequate in the near term  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single source near the company s plant  but alternative suppliers are available 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
various alloying elements used in the production of titanium ingot are available from a number of suppliers 
the company has agreed in principle to enter into long term agreements with certain suppliers for a substantial portion of its alloy requirements at fixed and or formula determined prices 
markets and customer base 
about of the company s sales were to customers within north america  with about to european customers and the balance to other regions 
no single customer represents more than of the company s direct sales 
however  in  about of the company s mill product shipments sales were used by the company s customers to produce parts and other materials for the aerospace industry 
the company expects that while a majority of its sales will be to the aerospace sector  other markets will continue to represent a significant portion of sales 
the commercial aerospace industry consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial aircraft boeing commercial airplane group and the airbus consortium and four major manufacturers of aircraft engines rolls royce  pratt whitney a unit of united technologies corporation  general electric and snecma 
the company s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use the company s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on the company 
the company s order backlog was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  approximately of the year end backlog is expected to be delivered during although the company believes that the backlog is a reliable indicator of near term business activity  conditions in the aerospace industry could change and result in future cancellations or deferrals of existing aircraft orders and materially and adversely affect the company s existing backlog  orders  and future financial condition and operating results 
as of december   the estimated firm order backlog for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor  was  planes versus  planes at the end of and  planes at the end of the newer wide body planes  such as the boeing and the airbus a and a  tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their frames  engines and parts as measured by total fly weight than narrow body planes 
fly weight is the empty weight of a finished aircraft with engines but without fuel or passengers 
the boeing  for example  utilizes titanium for approximately of total fly weight  compared to between to on the older  and models 
the estimated firm order backlog for wide body planes at year end was of total backlog compared to at the end of through various strategic relationships  the company seeks to gain access to unique process technologies for the manufacture of its products and to expand existing markets and create and develop new markets for titanium 
the company has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
the company also will continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  europe  fsu and china 
the company is one of four integrated producers in the world  with integrated producers being considered as those that produce at least both sponge and ingot 
there are also a number of non integrated producers that produce mill products from purchased sponge  scrap or ingot 
the company believes that most producers will generally operate at lower capacity levels in than in  increasing price competition 
the company s principal competitors in aerospace markets are allegheny teledyne inc  rti international metals  inc 
formerly rmi titanium company and verkhanya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo 
these companies  along with the japanese producers and other companies  are also principal competitors in industrial markets 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates  tariffs and  with respect to japan and the fsu  existing and prior duties including antidumping duties 
however  imports of titanium sponge  scrap  and mill products  principally from the fsu  have increased in recent years and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent the company has been able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing such sponge  scrap or intermediate mill products from such countries for use in its own operations during recent years  the negative effect of these imports on the company has been somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports into the us of titanium products from countries designated by the us government as most favored nations are subject to a tariff for other countries 
titanium products for tariff purposes are broadly classified as either wrought or unwrought 
wrought products include bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing 
unwrought products include sponge  ingot  slab and billet 
starting in  imports of titanium wrought products from russia were exempted from this duty under the generalized system of preferences or gsp program designed to aid developing economies 
in recent years  the gsp program has been subject to annual review and renewal and is currently scheduled to expire in the second quarter of in  gsp benefits to these products were suspended when the level of russian wrought products imports reached of all imports of titanium wrought products 
a petition was filed in to restore duty free status to these products  and that petition was granted in june in addition  a petition was also filed to bring unwrought products under the gsp program  which would allow such products from the countries of the fsu notably russia and  in the case of sponge  kazakhstan and ukraine to be imported into the us without the payment of regular duties 
this petition concerning unwrought products has not been acted upon pending further investigation of the merits of such a change 
in addition to regular duties  titanium sponge imported from countries of the fsu russia  kazakhstan and ukraine has for many years been subject to substantial antidumping penalties 
in addition  titanium sponge imports from japan were subject to a standing antidumping order  but no penalties had been attached in recent years 
in  the international trade commission itc revoked all outstanding antidumping orders on titanium sponge based upon a determination that changed circumstances in the industry did not warrant continuation of the orders 
timet has appealed that decision  with first hearings expected in the second quarter of pending the appeal  the orders remain revoked 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  all or any of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge and mill products and thus the business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
however  the company has  in recent years  been one of the largest importers of foreign titanium sponge and mill products into the us to the extent the company remains a substantial purchaser of these products  any adverse effects on product pricing as a result of any reduction in  or elimination of  any of these tariffs would be partially ameliorated by the decreased cost to the company for these products to the extent it currently bears the cost of the import duties 
producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be modified without substantial expenditures to produce titanium products 
the company believes  however  that entry as a producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
titanium mill products also compete with stainless steels  nickel alloys  steel  plastics  aluminum and composites in many applications 
research and development 
the company s research and development activities are directed toward improving process technology  developing new alloys  enhancing the performance of the company s products in current applications  and searching for new uses of titanium products 
for example  one of the company s proprietary alloys  timetal r s  has been specified for a number of aerospace applications  including the boeing additionally  timetal lcb  a low cost beta alloy  is being tested for new non aerospace applications  and timetal has been introduced into the sporting goods markets 
the company conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its henderson  nv laboratory  which the company believes is one of the largest titanium research and development centers in the world 
additional research and development activities are performed at the witton  england facility 
patents and trademarks 
the company holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology 
the company continually seeks patent protection with respect to its technical base and has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
however  most of the titanium alloys and manufacturing technology used by the company do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
the company believes that the trademarks timet r and timetal  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are significant to its business 
employees 
as of december   the company employed approximately  persons  in the us and in europe  down approximately from a total of  at the end of during  the company expects to reduce employment by an additional persons  the vast majority of which should occur during the first quarter 
the company s production and maintenance workers in henderson  nv and its production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  oh are represented by the united steelworkers of america uswa under contracts expiring in october and june  respectively 
employees at the company s other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
over of the salaried and hourly employees at the company s european facilities are members of various european labor unions  generally under annual agreements  certain of which are still under negotiation for the uswa engaged in a nine month work stoppage at the company s henderson facility in and in a three month stoppage at the toronto facility in while the company currently has long term contracts with the uswa and considers its employee relations to be satisfactory  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages that could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
regulatory and environmental matters 
the company s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include the federal clean air act  the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
the company uses and manufactures substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
in addition  at the company s henderson  nv facility  the company uses substantial quantities of titanium tetrachloride  a material classified as extremely hazardous under federal environmental laws 
the company has used such substances throughout the history of its operations 
as a result  risk of environmental damage is inherent in the company s operations 
the company s operations pose a continuing risk of accidental releases of  and worker exposure to  hazardous or toxic substances 
there is also a risk that government environmental requirements  or enforcement thereof  may become more stringent in the future 
there can be no assurances that some  or all  of the risks discussed under this heading will not result in liabilities that would be material to the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the company s operations in europe are similarly subject to foreign laws and regulations respecting environmental and worker safety matters  which laws are generally less stringent than us laws and which have not had  and are not presently expected to have  a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance that such foreign laws will not become more stringent 
the company believes that its operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker safety laws 
the company s policy is to continually strive to improve environmental  health and safety performance 
from time to time  the company may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties  but to date no material penalties have been incurred 
the company incurred capital expenditures for health  safety and environmental protection and compliance of approximately million in each of and  and its capital budget provides for approximately million of such expenditures in however  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts estimated to be required for such matters

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general 
the aerospace industry in recent history has accounted for approximately two thirds of us and to of worldwide titanium mill products consumption  and has had a significant effect on the overall sales and profitability of the titanium industry 
the aerospace industry  and consequently the titanium metals industry  is highly cyclical 
throughout  and much of  the company was producing titanium ingot and mill products for aerospace customers in contemplation of continuing record jet aircraft build rates then expected to last through at least during the second half of  it became evident to the company that the anticipated record rates of aircraft production would not be reached and that a decline in overall production rates would begin earlier than forecast  particularly in titanium intensive widebody planes 
as aerospace customers reduce inventories during and adjust to decreases in overall production rates  the company faces a decrease in demand from levels 
industrial demand for titanium has also declined due to weakness in asian and other economies 
the company estimates that worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products peaked in at approximately  metric tons and decreased in to approximately  metric tons 
the company also estimates industry mill product shipments will further decline in to approximately  metric tons 
the company s order backlog decreased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  and from million at december  the company defines order backlog as firm purchase orders which are generally subject to cancellation by the customer upon payment of specified charges 
the company expects that production levels  capacity utilization  sales volumes  sales prices  gross profit margins and operating income margins excluding special charges will all be lower in than they were in assuming demand remains at currently expected levels and does not decrease or increase significantly in  the company currently expects net losses in at least the first two quarters of and a return to modest profitability in the third or fourth quarter 
in both the aerospace and industrial sectors  reduced demand and lower prices including prices under new long term contracts with key aerospace customers will cause lower sales and gross profit margins 
the company has implemented plans to address the current market conditions  as more fully described in item business outlook for special restructuring charges in as a result of the company s action plans were million  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
expenses related to implementing and maintaining the company s business enterprise system and to addressing yk issues are expected to remain high in sales and operating income compared with net sales of the titanium melted and mill products segment in were below levels primarily due to lower volumes due to reduced demand during the last half of the year in both aerospace and industrial markets  as described above 
mill product shipment volume for the year declined to  metric tons 
selling prices on shipments were relatively flat  in large part due to prices on orders entered prior to the decline in demand 
average prices on shipments are expected to be to lower than in  reflecting both provisions of long term agreements effective in and increased price competition on non contract business 
net sales of the other segment were down primarily as a result of the company s ceasing to consolidate its castings business after july see note to the consolidated financial statements 
total cost of sales was of sales in  comparable to of sales in cost of sales is expected to be a higher percent of sales in  as the effect of lower average selling prices  lower volumes and higher depreciation will more than offset the positive effect of the company s cost saving initiatives 
selling  general  administrative and developmental expenses in were higher than in  in both total dollar and percent of sales terms  up from  in large part due to information technology costs  including implementation of the company s enterprise wide business information system and addressing yk issues 
equity in earnings of joint ventures of the titanium melted and mill products segment improved in over principally due to improved earnings of valtimet 
equity losses of the other segment were higher in as certain ventures were held for the full year  compared to a part year in operating income of the titanium melted and mill products segment in included special charges of million and the other segment included million of charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sales and operating income compared with the significant improvement in sales  operating income and operating margins of the titanium melted and mill products segment in over were driven by price and volume increases for titanium products in both commercial aerospace and other markets 
sales volume of titanium mill products increased in  to approximately  metric tons 
average selling prices in increased  reflecting both the pass through of cost increases  particularly raw material costs  and real price improvement associated with increased market demand 
the other segment results declined significantly in relative to in large part due to deterioration in the golf castings market 
total cost of sales in was of sales versus of sales in  reflecting the real price improvement in sales  higher volumes and generally higher operating levels at the company s plants 
selling  general  administrative and development expenses as a percent of sales in were higher than in primarily due to higher information technology and market product development costs 
equity in earnings of joint ventures in consisted principally of the company s interest in tht  reported by the equity method prior to the ajm acquisition 
operating income of the titanium melted and mill products segment in included special charges of million related to the imi acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
european operations 
the company has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally the united kingdom  with smaller operations in france  italy and germany 
titanium is a worldwide market and the factors influencing the company s us and europe operations are substantially the same 
the relative changes in sales to customers in europe increased compared to and to customers in the us declined were impacted  respectively  by the acquisition of loterios in april and deconsolidation of the company s castings operations in july approximately one half of the company s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally major european currencies 
certain purchases of raw materials  principally titanium sponge and alloys  for the company s european operations are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the functional currencies of the company s european subsidiaries are those of their respective countries  thus  the us dollar value of these subsidiaries sales and costs denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  including sales and costs denominated in us dollars  are subject to exchange rate fluctuations which may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
borrowings of the company s european operations may be in us dollars or in functional currencies 
the company s export sales from the united states are denominated in us dollars and as such are not subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the u 
s 
dollar sales and purchases of the company s european operations described above provide some natural hedge of non functional currencies  and the company does not use currency contracts to hedge its currency exposures 
net currency transaction translation gains losses included in income were less than 
million in each of the past three years 
at december   consolidated assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies were approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of u 
s 
dollar cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and borrowings 
exchange rates among european currencies including the french franc  italian lira and german mark but excluding the uk pound sterling became fixed relative to each other as a result of the new european currency unit euro effective in costs associated with modifications of systems to handle euro denominated transactions have not been significant 
general corporate income 
general corporate income which accounts for substantially all of the consolidated statement of operations caption other income consists principally of earnings on corporate cash equivalents and varies with cash levels and interest rates 
such income in is expected to be lower than in interest expense 
interest expense was lower in than  principally due to lower average borrowing levels 
while average borrowing levels increased in over  interest rates declined and interest capitalized increased 
interest expense in is expected to be higher than in due to higher average borrowing levels and lower levels of interest capitalization due to lower capital expenditures 
minority interest 
annual dividend expense related to the convertible preferred securities  issued in november  approximates million and is reported as minority interest net of allocable income taxes 
other minority interest relates primarily to the interest in timet savoie held by cezus 
income taxes 
the company operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pretax income can impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
in and  the company s income tax rate also varied from the us statutory rate due to reductions in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to current year utilization of tax attributes and a million reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance resulting from a change in estimate of the net operating loss carryforwards and alternative minimum tax carryforwards that would more likely than not be realized in the future 
for financial reporting purposes  the company has recognized all of its net operating loss carryforwards 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year yk 
year issues exist because many computer systems and applications currently use two digit fields to designate a year 
date sensitive systems may recognize the year as  or not at all 
this inability to treat the year properly could cause systems to process critical financial  manufacturing and operational information incorrectly 
most of the company s information systems have been replaced in connection with the implementation of the company s business enterprise system  the initial implementation of which was substantially completed with the rollout of the system to the uk in february the cost of the new system  including related equipment and networks  aggregated approximately million in million capital  million expense with an additional million to million expected to be incurred in the company  with the help of outside specialists and consultants i has substantially completed an initial assessment of potential yk issues in its non information systems eg  its manufacturing and communication systems  as well as in those information systems that were not replaced by the new enterprise wide system  ii is in the process of determining  prioritizing and implementing remedial actions  including testing  and iii will develop contingency plans in the event internal or external yk issues are not resolved by the company s june  target date for completion 
the company s yk readiness varies by location 
some locations have completed their internal yk readiness plans while others are in the midst of remediation and testing 
at this time  most sites anticipate completing their respective yk readiness plans by the june target date 
however  remediation of some items at the henderson  nv site  and possibly others  could be delayed beyond the june target date 
the company expended approximately million on these specific non information system yk issues in  principally embedded system technology  and expects to incur approximately million on such issues in the company s evaluation of potential yk exposures related to key suppliers and customers is also in process and will continue throughout although the company believes its key information systems will be yk ready before the end of  it cannot yet fully predict the outcome or success of the yk readiness programs related to certain of its embedded manufacturing systems or those comparable systems of its suppliers or customers 
the company also cannot predict whether it will find additional problems that would result in unplanned upgrades of applications after june or even december as a result of these uncertainties  the company cannot predict the impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows or operations resulting from yk failures in systems that the company directly or indirectly relies upon 
should the company s yk readiness plan not be successful or be delayed beyond december  the consequences to the company could be far reaching and material  including an inability to produce titanium metal products at its manufacturing facilities  which could lead to an indeterminate amount of lost revenue 
other potential negative consequences could include impeded communications or power supplies  slower transaction processing and financial reporting  and potential liability to third parties 
although not anticipated  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of failure by the company or its key suppliers or customers to become yk ready would be a short term slowdown or cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more of the company s facilities and a short term inability on the part of the company to process orders and billings in a timely manner  and to deliver product to customers 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had million of cash and equivalents and million of borrowing availability under its us and european bank credit lines 
available borrowings in the future could potentially be reduced due to the leverage and interest coverage ratios included in the company s us credit agreement 
net debt at year end was million million of cash and equivalents and million of notes payable and long term debt  principally borrowings under the company s us and us long term bank credit agreements 
the convertible preferred securities do not require principal amortization and the company has the right to defer interest payments for one or more periods of up to consecutive quarters 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in and million in cash used by operating activities was million in  as summarized below 
in millions excluding changes in assets and liabilities changes in assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  during the past three years generally follows the trend in operating results 
changes in assets and liabilities reflect the timing of purchases  production and sales  and can vary significantly from period to period 
accounts receivable increased used cash in and primarily because sales levels were increasing  and provided cash in as sales levels were decreasing 
the company currently expects net collections of receivables to be a source of cash in  particularly in the early part of the year due to both lower sales levels and improved collection efforts 
inventories increased in  reflecting the higher activity levels  and decreased in as a result of very high shipment levels in the fourth quarter of that year 
inventories increased significantly in  reflecting material purchases and build rates that were based on expected sales levels higher than the actual sales level turned out to be 
the company expects to significantly reduce inventories during as excess raw materials are consumed and other reduction control efforts are realized 
changes in net current income taxes payable increased in and and decreased in in part due to the delayed timing of cash payments for taxes in europe relative to earnings 
changes in accounts with related parties resulted primarily from payment of accrued interest in and relative changes in receivable levels with joint ventures in and investing activities 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  up from million in and million in about one half of capital expenditures during the two year period related to capacity expansion projects associated with long term customer agreements  which projects are also expected to improve cycle times and yields and to increase efficiency 
the majority of these significant projects in both the us and europe have come on line or will be complete by the end of the first quarter of approximately one fourth of the two year period capital spending related to the major business enterprise wide information systems and information technology project being implemented throughout the company 
the new system was implemented in stages in the us during  with initial implementation substantially completed with the rollout to the uk in february certain costs associated with the business enterprise information systems project  including training and reengineering  are expensed as incurred 
capital spending for is currently expected to be below million  which is less than expected depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million 
cash used for business acquisitions and joint ventures in related primarily to the loterios and wyman gordon transactions more fully described in notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements 
in  such investments consist primarily of cash contributions in connection with the formation of valtimet and investments in companies developing new markets and uses for titanium 
acquisitions in consisted of the imi titanium acquisition  the ajm acquisition and other smaller european acquisitions  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in october  the company purchased million of special metals corporation convertible preferred stock the smc preferred stock  in connection with smc s acquisition of the inco alloys international high performance nickel alloys business unit of inco limited 
no dividends have been paid to date on the smc preferred stock due to limitations imposed by smc bank credit agreement  and the company believes that these limitations may prevent smc s payment of dividends for some time 
financing activities 
net borrowings of million in were primarily to fund capital expenditures and the loterios acquisition 
net debt repayments of million in relate primarily to reductions in european working capital borrowings  including amounts due to cezus  the company s minority partner in timet savoie 
the company s net proceeds from the initial public offering in june approximated million 
the company used approximately million of such net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness  including amounts due to tremont and imi 
the company received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the convertible preferred securities by timet capital trust i in november the company used approximately million of such net proceeds to repay indebtedness incurred in conjunction with the ajm acquisition 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its alternative uses of capital  its debt service requirements  the cost of debt and equity capital  and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and  in light of its current outlook  may in the future seek to raise additional capital  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  incur  refinance or restructure indebtedness  repurchase shares of capital stock  sell assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to increase or manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  the company investigates  evaluates  discusses and engages in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the titanium  specialty metal and related industries 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunities  the company may consider using then available liquidity  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness
