the increase in expenses excluding customer funding is primarily due to the piezosensors acquisition  partially offset by additional design work being performed in lower cost far east locations 
the sensor segment receives substantial funding from customers for development projects  amounting to million in versus in and million in the increase in customer funding for more than offset the additional expenses associated with the piezosensors acquisition and automotive related development projects 
the company s revenue growth is likely to continue to rely on expansion of its product lines 
accordingly  research and development expenses will continue to be significant  although  it is anticipated these expenses as a percentage of net sales will continue to decline

capital expenditures for continued to be driven mainly by new product introductions and technologies as well as investments in computer hardware and software 
production equipment was installed at msi s engineering center in virginia and at jl  to expand their capabilities for development and production of industrial pressure transducers and consumer product subassemblies 
jl also further improved its leased facility 
the growth of consumer product line extensions resulted in additional spending  by ml  on new product tooling for use by subcontractors 
msi and jl purchased computer hardware and software to improve engineering and office productivity 
the company expects such capital spending to continue  in line with expansions of its product lines and staff size 
additionally  the future success of the company s sensor segment could necessitate significantly larger expenditures for production equipment 
there were no material commitments for capital expenditures at march  during the year  the company financed its requirements  excluding the piezosensors acquisition  with internally generated cash  accounts payable and bank borrowings 
rdl  the company s principal supplier  assembles substantially all the company s consumer products

in june   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments 
the statement  which is effective for financial years beginning after june  sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair market value 
under certain circumstances  a portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of income when the transaction affects earnings 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in income in the period of change 
the company believes that adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
the year issue the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year if uncorrected  this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company s significant business computer systems have been upgraded  tested and are believed to be compliant 
the cost of these upgrades was not material 
communications with suppliers and customers that interface with the company s business systems will continue throughout to try to assure there is not a significant impact on the company s operations 
based upon communications with customers  and review of publically available information  the company believes its major suppliers and customers have either substantially achieved or have active programs to achieve year compliance 
none of the company s products have date sensitive software or embedded chips and accordingly the year issue is not applicable to products we sell 
the company believes that it has an effective program to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
because of the range of possible issues and the large number of variables involved  it is impossible to quantify the potential cost of problems should the company or its trading partners fail to complete all year plans and become completely year compliant 
the current assessment is that such costs and failure of compliance efforts would not have a material adverse effect 
the company believes that the most likely risks of serious year business disruption are external in nature  including disruption of utility and transportation services  customers non compliance  and disruptions in the general economy 
because the company expects to be compliant for all business critical systems  no contingency plans have been established at this time 
the company will reevaluate its readiness throughout calendar and determine what  if any  contingency plans are required at that time
