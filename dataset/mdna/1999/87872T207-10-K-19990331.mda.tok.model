the effect of this was to lower domestic pre tax earnings as a percentage of consolidated pre tax earnings

the cautionary statements provided below are being made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra for any such forward looking information 
many of the factors discussed below  as well as other factors  have also been discussed in prior filings made by the company 
factors which could cause the company s actual financial and other results to differ materially from any results that might be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by the company in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following year issue the year issue is a general term used to address a class of problems which are caused by the inability of computer programs to recognize various date values around january  this class of problems could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations such as  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has conducted an assessment of its computer information systems and has determined the nature and extent of the work required to ensure that its internal systems are year compliant 
the majority of the software used by the company has been purchased as packaged software 
a minimal customization practice has been followed to support a more direct transition from an older version of a packaged software application to a newer version of the same application 
the company s internal systems can be grouped in two principal categories its accounting and human resources software and its legacy systems that perform a variety of page processes 
with respect to the suite of software products licensed by the company and relied upon in the administration of accounting and human resources functions  which was licensed by the company in the first quarter of its fiscal year  the licensor has indicated that the version currently employed by the company will need to have patches applied in order for the software package to be year compliant 
the company intends to apply the presently available patches for this purpose in the near term  and plans also to apply future patches to address the year issue as they are made available 
based on currently available information  the company believes the expense associated with these efforts will not be material 
the company expects that updates and enhancements to this software package will be installed and operational prior to january   and intends to seek assurances from the licensor to the effect that these updates and enhancements will result in the software package becoming year compliant 
the company expects that additional issues concerning year compliance will be reported by the licensor to the company and updates will be provided by the licensor 
the company has received the most recent updates and enhancements pursuant to a software support service agreement presently in place with the licensor  an agreement which is in effect and the company does not currently intend to terminate 
provided that the licensor gives such assurances concerning the updates and enhancements to its software product suite  the company does not expect that it will incur additional expense aside from the cost of the software support service agreement in order to bring its accounting and human resources software package into year compliance 
other important internal business processes of the company  such as time and expense reporting and labor distribution  are performed by legacy systems that are not year compliant 
in accordance with previously established plans to integrate these functions with the accounting and human resources software described above and to upgrade these systems with the intent of improving the company s ability to manage its increasingly multinational operations  the company presently plans to replace these legacy systems in calendar year  both to address the year issue and to attempt to achieve business benefits 
the company estimates that the cost associated with replacing these systems  excluding labor costs  will be less than million  and has provided for the replacement of these systems in its operating and capital budgets for calendar year with the exception of the time and expense application software distributed to field personnel  vendors of the standard software packages have been contacted and patches and or newer versions of the applications have been secured 
distribution of the patches and newer versions of the software will occur in the second and third quarters of the calendar year based on presently available information  the company believes that any necessary compliance efforts concerning its internal systems will not have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
however  if compliance efforts of which the company is not currently aware are required and are not completed on time  or if the cost of any required updating  modification or replacement of the company s information systems exceeds the company s estimates  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
page in addition to the company s internal systems  the company relies on third party vendors in the conduct of its business 
for example  third party vendors handle the payroll function for the company  and the company also relies on the services of telecommunication companies  banks  utilities  and commercial airlines  among others 
the company has sought assurances from its material vendors and suppliers that there will be no interruption of service as a result of the year issue  and to the extent such assurances have not been given  the company is devising contingency plans to mitigate the effects on the conduct of the company s business in the event the year issue results in the unavailability of services 
there can be no assurance that any contingency plans developed by the company will prevent any such service interruption on the part of one or more of the company s third party suppliers from having a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the failure on the part of the accounting systems of the company s clients due to the year issue could result in a delay in the payment of invoices issued by the company for services and expenses 
a failure of the accounting systems of a significant number of the company s clients would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has generally refrained from performing year remediation services for its clients 
it is possible  however  that former  present and future clients could assert that certain services performed by the company from time to time involve or are related to the year issue 
the company has recommended  implemented and customized various third party software packages for its clients  and to the extent that such software programs may not be year compliant  the company could be subjected to claims as a result thereof 
since the company s inception in  it also has designed and developed software and systems for its clients 
due to the large number of such engagements undertaken by the company over the years  there can be no assurance that all such software programs and systems will be year compliant  which could also result in the assertion of claims against the company 
the company s policy has been to endeavor to secure provisions in its client contracts that  among other things  disclaim implied warranties  limit the duration of the company s express warranties  relate the company s liability to the amount of fees paid by the client to the company in connection with the project  and disclaim any liability arising from third party software that is implemented  customized or installed by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure contractual protections in agreements concerning future projects  or that any contractual protections secured by the company in agreements governing pending and completed projects will dissuade the other party thereto from asserting claims against the company with respect to the year issue 
due to the complexity of the year issue  upon any failure of critical client systems or processes that may be directly or indirectly connected or related to systems or software designed  developed  customized or implemented by the company as described above  the company may be subjected to claims regardless of whether the failure is related to the services provided by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to establish that it did not cause or contribute to the failure of a critical client system or process 
there also can be no assurance that the contractual protections  if any  secured by the company in connection with any past  present or future clients will operate to insulate the company from  or limit the amount of  any liability arising from claims asserted against the company 
if asserted  the resolution of such page claims and the associated defense costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
rapid technological change the systems consulting and implementation market has experienced rapid technological advances and developments in recent years 
failure of the company to stay abreast of such advances and developments could materially adversely affect its business 
the company additionally utilizes a number of different technologies in developing and providing it solutions for its customers 
the technologies used by the company are developing rapidly and are characterized by evolving industry standards in a wide variety of areas 
while the company evaluates technologies on an ongoing basis and endeavors to utilize those that are most effective in developing it solutions for its customers  there can be no assurance that the technologies utilized by the company and the expertise gained in those technologies will continue to be applicable in the future 
there can be no assurance that new technologies will be made available to the company or that such technologies can be economically applied by the company 
the inability to apply existing technologies and expertise to subsequent projects could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
management of growth the company s business has grown significantly since its inception  and the company anticipates future growth 
the growth of the company s business and the expansion of its customer base have resulted in a corresponding growth in the demands on the company s management and other personnel and its operating systems and internal controls 
any future growth may further strain existing management resources and operational  financial  human resources and management information systems and controls  which may not be adequate to support the company s operations 
the company is currently increasing its expense levels as a result of a number of factors  including increases in the number of employees  investments in equipment  training of employees and the development of methodologies  tools  etc 
an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing and other expenses  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage its recent or future growth successfully 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to grow or sustain the rate of growth it has experienced in the past 
the company expects that it will need to further develop its financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures to accommodate future growth 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop such controls  systems or procedures effectively or on a timely basis  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
page ability to attract and retain employees the company s business consists mainly of professional services and is inherently labor intensive 
the company s success depends in large part upon its ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly project managers and other senior personnel  for its domestic and international operations 
qualified project managers within and outside the united states are in particularly great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
several attributes of the company s work environment pose challenges to the company s ability to attract and retain employees  including i extensive travel requirements  ii the company s intense work environment and culture  iii the company s standards for employee technical skills and job performance  and iv the company s practice of adjusting the number of technical personnel to reflect active project levels 
although the company expects to continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees and to retain its existing project managers and other senior personnel for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
growth by acquisition the company may grow in part by acquiring existing businesses 
the success of any such acquisition will depend upon  among other things  the ability of the company and its management to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into its organization effectively  to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired firms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  consummate acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations into the company 
in addition  acquisitions by the company may involve certain other risks  including potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
dependence on key personnel although the company does not believe that the loss of any particular individual would have a material adverse impact on the company  the loss of some or all of the company s project managers could have a material adverse impact on the company  including its ability to secure and complete engagements 
the company has employment agreements with its president  group president  executive officers and its vice presidents that contain noncompetition  nondisclosure and nonsolicitation covenants 
the employment agreements with the president  group president and executive officers do not have fixed expiration dates and may be terminated by either the company or the employee on days written notice 
the employment agreements with the other vice presidents generally have a fixed initial term but are automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless terminated by either the company or the employee on days written notice 
other senior employees also have employment agreements that are generally terminable by the company or the employee upon to days written notice 
unassigned labor costs the company s unassigned labor costs  which represent salaries and other expenses allocated to systems professionals not assigned to a specific project  have gradually increased as a percentage page of revenues over time 
the company attempts to reassign employees who meet its performance requirements to other active projects when they are no longer needed on a particular project 
however  since the company generally recruits personnel in advance of the commencement of certain projects in order to meet the needs of such projects  any cancellation or delays in the anticipated projects could increase the unassigned labor costs and might cause a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
cyclicality certain of the company s customers and potential customers are in industries that experience cyclical variations in profitability  which may in turn affect their willingness or ability to fund systems projects such as those for which the company may be engaged 
the company s experience indicates  however  that competitive pressures in cyclical industries sometimes compel businesses to undertake systems projects even during periods of losses or reduced profitability 
quarterly results may fluctuate the company s results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of various factors such as differences in the number of billing days and or holidays between quarters  the number of vacation days and sick days taken by the company s employees in a particular quarter  and varying weather conditions 
these and other factors can reduce revenues in a given quarter with a corresponding adverse impact on the company s margins 
project risks because of the project based nature of the company s work and the fact that many of the projects undertaken by the company are large projects  there is a risk of a material adverse impact on operating results because of the unanticipated suspension or cancellation of a large project or the financial difficulties of a client 
the suspension or cancellation of a project or the financial difficulties of a client could result in a decrease in revenues  the need to reassign staff  a potential dispute with a client regarding monies owed for consulting work and expenses  and damage to tsc s reputation 
in addition  because many of the company s projects are high profile  mission critical projects for major clients  a failure or inability to meet a client s expectations with respect to a major project undertaken by the company could damage its reputation and affect its ability to attract new business 
third party products and services are integral to the success of certain company projects 
to the extent that third parties do not deliver effective products and services on a timely basis  the company s project results could be negatively impacted 
although the company attempts to limit this risk in its engagement arrangements with clients and maintains errors and omissions insurance  the failure of a project could also result in significant financial exposure to the company 
competition the systems consulting and implementation market comprises a large number of participants  is subject to rapid changes and is highly competitive 
the company competes with and faces potential competition from a number of companies that have significantly greater financial  page technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company 
the company also competes with smaller service providers whose specific  more narrowly focused service offerings may be more attractive to potential clients than the company s multi dimensional approach 
the company s clients primarily consist of fortune and other large corporations and there are an increasing number of professional services firms seeking systems consulting and implementation engagements from that client base 
the company believes that its ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside its control  including the ability of its competitors to hire  retain and motivate a significant number of senior project managers  the ownership by competitors of software used by potential clients  the development by others of software that is competitive with the company s products and services  and the price at which others offer comparable services 
in addition  the company s clients could develop or acquire in house expertise in services similar to those provided by the company  which would significantly reduce demand for the company s services 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to maintain its existing client base  maintain or increase the level of revenue generated by its existing clients or be able to attract new clients 
susceptibility to general economic conditions the company s revenues and results of operations will be subject to fluctuations based on the general economic conditions of the united states as well as the foreign countries in which it operates 
if there were to be a general economic downturn or a recession in the united states or the foreign countries in which it operates  then the company expects that business enterprises would cut back their spending on  or reduce their budget for  it services 
in the event of such an economic downturn  there can be no assurance that the company s business  operating results and financial condition would not be materially adversely affected 
cost overruns although the company s engagements are generally on a time and materials basis  some of its projects are on a not to exceed or fixed price basis 
the failure of the company to complete a project to the client s satisfaction within the not to exceed or fixed fee exposes the company to unrecoverable cost overruns  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property rights a majority of the company s clients have required that the company grant to them all proprietary and intellectual property rights with respect to the work product resulting from the company s performance of services  including the intellectual property rights to any custom software developed by the company for them 
each grant of proprietary and intellectual property rights limits the company s ability to reuse work product components and work product solutions with other clients 
in a limited number of such situations  the company has obtained  and in the future may attempt to obtain  ownership interest or a license from its clients to permit the company to market custom software for the joint benefit of the client and the company 
these arrangements may be nonexclusive or exclusive  and licensors to the company may retain the right to sell products and services that compete with those of the company 
there can be no assurance  page however  that the company will be able to negotiate software licenses upon terms acceptable to the company 
the company also develops certain foundation and application software tools  methodologies and products that are owned by the company and licensed to its clients 
the company regards these software tools  methodologies and products as proprietary and intends to protect its rights  where appropriate  with registered copyrights  patents  registered trademarks  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure and transferring title 
there can be no assurance that any of these steps taken by the company will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary rights or independent third party development of functionally equivalent products 
tsc is a registered service mark of technology solutions company 
in addition  the company s success is dependent upon its specialized expertise and methodologies 
to protect it proprietary information  the company relies upon a combination of trade secret and common law  employee nondisclosure policies and third party confidentiality agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these steps taken by the company will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its specialized expertise and methodologies 
although the company believes that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against the company in the future 
risks of conducting international operations the company has been significantly increasing its international operations in recent years 
because the cost of doing business abroad is typically higher for us businesses than the cost of doing business domestically  the company could experience a decline in its operating margins as the significance of its international operations increases 
international operations and the provision of services in foreign markets are subject to a number of special risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  political risks  additional security concerns and risks of increases in duties  taxes and governmental royalties  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies 
in addition  the company s growth internationally will depend upon its ability to attract  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees in each of those foreign countries where it conducts operations 
competition for such local personnel qualified to deliver most of the company s services is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recruit  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees to successfully compete internationally
