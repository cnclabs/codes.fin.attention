item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including those set forth under factors that may affect future results under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in  or incorporated by reference into  this report 
overview the company develops  markets  and supports an integrated suite of applications that automates the management of complex  enterprise wide information and infrastructure assets 
during fiscal  the company determined that customer needs required a more comprehensive solution for control and management of their infrastructure assets  including availability of assets  minimizing investments and expense  consolidating data  and interfacing to enterprise applications 
accordingly  the company refocused its marketing strategy and product positioning to focus on this infrastructure management strategy 
the company s focus on the infrastructure management strategy  the company s rapid growth  and the company s acquisitions have resulted in continuing efforts to redefine the product development strategy  establish a comprehensive marketing strategy  and strengthen the company s financial and budgeting processes 
executing on that strategy  in september the company acquired united software  inc  including its wholly owned subsidiary apsylog sa apsylog 
during fiscal  the company continued to execute on its infrastructure management strategy  making several strategic acquisitions to expand its product offerings 
in july  the company acquired innovative tech systems  inc innovative providing the company with software products and experience to address facilities infrastructure management 
in september  the company completed the acquisition of certain technology and other assets and liabilities from international software solutions and related persons and entities collectively iss  expanding the company s information technology infrastructure management offerings 
in march  the company entered into the fleet infrastructure management market with the acquisition prototype  inc prototype 
the company s software products are currently available on most major computer operating platforms  however for the past two years over of the company s license sales have been attributable to unix and windows nt platforms 
the company s revenues are derived from product licensing and services 
services are comprised of maintenance  professional services  and training 
license fees are generally due upon the granting of the license and typically include a one year maintenance period as part of the license agreement 
the company also provides ongoing maintenance services  which include technical support and product enhancements  for an annual fee based upon the current price of the product 
revenues from license agreements are recognized currently  provided that all of the following conditions are met a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been delivered  there are no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable and the risk of concession is deemed remote  and no other significant vendor obligations exist 
revenues from post contract support services are recognized ratably over the term of the support period  generally one year 
maintenance revenues which are bundled with license agreements are unbundled using vendor specific objective evidence 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services most often performed on a time and material basis under separate service agreements for the installation of the company s products 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the respective services are performed 
we currently derive a substantial portion of our license revenues from the sale of its infrastructure management applications and expect them to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of the infrastructure management strategy and applications  including future product enhancements 
factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for or market acceptance of the infrastructure management applications  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company conducts business overseas in a number of foreign currencies  principally in europe 
these currencies have been relatively stable against the us dollar for the past several years 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a significant impact on the company s revenues or results of operations 
although the company currently derives no revenues from highly inflationary economies  the company is expanding its presence in international markets outside europe  including the pacific rim and latin america  whose currencies have tended to fluctuate more relative to the us dollar 
there can be no assurance that european currencies will remain stable relative to the us dollar or that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company has implemented a foreign currency forward hedging program 
the hedging program consists primarily of using forward rate currency contracts of approximately one month in length to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
currency contracts are in accordance with sfas no 
and receive hedge accounting treatment 
accordingly  to the extent properly hedged by obligations denominated in local currencies  the company s foreign operations remain subject to the risks of future foreign currency fluctuations  and there can be no assurances that the company s hedging activities will adequately protect the company against such risk 
the maximum amounts outstanding during fiscal have been less million and have been for approximately one month in duration 
to date the company s pacific rim sales activity has not been material 
accordingly  the company s operations and financial conditions have not been materially impacted by the recent asian financial crisis 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues 
march  statement of operations data revenues licenses services total revenues costs and expenses cost of licenses cost of services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of intangible assets acquired in process research and development 
total costs and expenses operating income loss interest income expense and other 
income loss from before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal years ended march    and revenues total revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing year to year increases of between and and between and licenses 
license revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the increases in license revenues are attributable to increased demand for new licenses  introduction of new applications  licenses of products obtained in the acquisitions  additional seats purchased by existing customers  higher average transaction sizes  more effective corporate marketing programs  improved sales force productivity  expansion of the company s domestic and international sales forces 
license revenues attributable to each acquisition are included in the company s combined financial statements of operations subsequent to the acquisition date 
services 
services revenues were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar increases are attributable to renewals of maintenance agreements from the company s expanded installed base of customers  maintenance revenues included as part of new licenses  and an increased number of consulting engagements related to implementation of software from initial license agreements and training fees 
costs and expenses cost of licenses 
cost of licenses revenues was   and  for fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total license revenues in the respective periods 
cost of services 
cost of services revenues was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of services revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar and percentage increases in fiscal and are attributable to an increase in customer support personnel and professional services personnel to meet the corresponding increase in professional services revenue 
the cost of services all increased as the customer support and professional services operations of the apsylog  innovative  iss and prototype acquisitions have been combined in the company s financial statements of operations from each acquisition date 
cost of services increased as a percentage of related revenues due largely to a greater percentage growth in lower margin consulting revenue compared to support revenue and to a lesser extent to increased labor and related management costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar increases are attributable to the significant expansion of the north american and international sales forces  increases in direct marketing cots  the effect of combining the apsylog  innovative  iss and prototype acquisitions in operations from each date thereof  and moderate operating expense increases 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal to fiscal as a result of increased sales force productivity 
if the company experiences a decrease in sales force productivity or for any other reason a decline in revenues  it is likely that operating margins will decline as well 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar increases from fiscal through fiscal are due primarily to the increased dollar amount of product author commissions  increased research and development personnel  and the effect of combining the apsylog  innovative  iss and prototype acquisitions in operations from each date thereof 
research and development expenses have decreased as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal through fiscal as a result of revenues increasing at a faster rate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  representing   and of total revenues in the respective periods 
the dollar increases are attributable primarily to costs associated with administrative personnel additions to support the company s growth and the effect of combining the apsylog  innovative  iss and prototype acquisitions in operations from each date thereof 
acquired in process research and development costs 
acquired in process research and development costs of million and million were incurred in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal amount relates to the apsylog acquisition 
the fiscal amount is attributable to the innovative  iss  and prototype acquisitions 
no acquired in process research and development costs were incurred in fiscal year the value of each acquisitions acquired in process technology was computed using discounted cash flow analysis on the anticipated income stream of the related product sales 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
with respect to the acquired in process technology  the calculations of value were adjusted to reflect the value creation efforts of the companies acquired prior to the close of each acquisition 
the nature of the efforts required to develop acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet their design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
if the project and technologies are not completed as planned  they will neither satisfy the technical requirements of a changing market nor be cost effective 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected product sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
the company currently believes that actual results have been consistent with forecasts with respect to acquired in process revenues 
because the company does not account for expenses by product  it is not possible to determine the actual expenses associated with any of the acquired technologies 
however  the company believes that expenses incurred to date associated with the development and integration of the acquired in process research and development projects are substantially consistent with the company s previous estimates 
the company has completed many of the original research and development projects in accordance with the plans outlined above 
the company continues to work toward the completion of other projects 
the majority of the projects are on schedule  but delays may occur due to changes in technological and market requirements for the company s products 
the risk associated with these efforts are still considered high and no assurance can be made that any upcoming products will meet with market acceptance 
delays in the introduction of certain products may adversely affect the company s revenues and earnings in future quarters 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets amounted to million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing and of total revenues in the respective periods  compared with zero for fiscal the fiscal amount is due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with the apsylog acquisition 
the fiscal amount is due to the continued amortization of the intangible assets associated with the apsylog acquisition and the amortization of the intangible assets associated with the innovative  iss  and prototype acquisitions completed during fiscal provision for income taxes income tax benefit in fiscal  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million resulting from the utilization of a portion of the company s available net operating loss carryforwards as an offset against taxable income 
in fiscal and  the company recorded an income tax expense of million and million  respectively 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to partially offset the carrying value of its net deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding its realization 
management evaluates on a quarterly basis the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and the amount of the valuation allowance 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation on the company s financial position has not been significant to date 
liquidity and capital resources until april  the company financed its operations through bank borrowings and private sales of common stock 
in fiscal  the company s net repayments on borrowings totaled million 
in fiscal  the company generated million in cash from operations  which was reduced by a net cash use of million by a discontinued business resulting in million net cash provided from operations 
in april  the company completed the initial public offering of its common stock  which resulted in net proceeds to the company of million 
in fiscal  the company generated million in cash from operations  paid million for capital expenditures and repaid million on bank and long term debt 
in fiscal  the company generated million in cash from operations  paid million for capital expenditures and repaid million on long term debt 
as of march  and  the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  for federal income tax purposes which expire beginning in utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to annual limitations resulting from certain changes in ownership of the company 
at march  and  the company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company believes that its current cash and short term investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next months 
although operating activities may provide cash in certain periods  to the extent the company experiences growth in the future  the company anticipates that its operating and investing activities may use cash 
consequently  any such future growth may require the company to obtain equity or debt financing  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or which may be dilutive 
year risks many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
the company utilizes third party equipment and software that may not be year compliant and is conducting an internal audit of products provided by outside vendors to determine if such third party products are year compliant 
although such audit is not yet completed  the company has received assurances from suppliers of all third party software that the company deems material to its business that such software is year compliant 
failure of such third party equipment or software to operate properly with regard to the year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  and financial condition 
if key systems  or a significant number of systems  were to fail as a result of year problems or if the company was to experience delays implementing year compliant software products  the company could incur substantial costs and disruption of its business  which would potentially have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial conditions 
the company is still assessing the impact the year issue will have on its proprietary software products and internal information systems and will take appropriate corrective actions based on the results of such analyses 
to date the company has spent less than  management of the company has not yet determined the full costs related to achieving year compliance but does not believe any additional costs will be material 
to the extent the cost of achieving year compliance are material  such costs will have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company tests and evaluates its own software products and believes that its software products are generally year compliant  meaning that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not materially affect the performance of such software products with respect to four digit date dependent data or the ability of such products to correctly create  store  process  and output information related to such data 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will not subsequently learn that certain of its software products do not contain all necessary software routines and codes necessary for the accurate calculation  display  storage  and manipulation of data involving dates 
in addition  in certain circumstances  the company has warranted that the use or occurrence of dates on or after january  will not adversely affect the performance of its products with respect to four digit date dependent data or the ability to create  store  process  and output information related to such data 
if any licensees experience year problems  such licensees could assert claims for damages 
in addition  the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues 
many companies are expending significant resources to correct their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase software products such as those offered by the company  which could have an adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company 
factors that may affect future results this report  including this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statement and other prospective information relating to future events 
these forward looking statements and other information are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated results  including the following history of operating losses 
through march   the company has recorded cumulative net losses of approximately million  including approximately million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions 
the company s applications have changed substantially since the mid s 
in addition  the company has acquired a significant number of applications bringing its total number of applications to in excess of in the last three years 
as a result  prediction of the company s future operating results is difficult  if not impossible 
although the company achieved profitability during the years ended march  and excluding the impact of the million charge related to acquired in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to remain profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the company does not believe that the growth in revenues it has experienced in recent years is indicative of future revenue growth or future operating results 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results  lengthy sales cycle  seasonality 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include  among others  the ability of the company to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of its software on a timely basis  market demand for the company s software  the size  timing and contractual terms of significant orders  the timing and significance of new software product announcements or releases by the company or its competitors  changes in pricing policies by the company or its competitors  changes in the company s business strategies  budgeting cycles of its potential customers  changes in the mix of software products and services sold  reliance on indirect sales forces like systems integrators and channels  changes in the mix of revenues attributable to domestic and international sales  the impact of acquisitions of competitors  seasonal trends  the cancellations of licenses or maintenance agreements  product life cycles  software defects and other product quality problems  and personnel changes 
the company has often recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month or weeks of a quarter 
as a result  license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in the last month or weeks of that quarter 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
in particular  the timing of revenue recognition can be affected by many factors  including the timing of contract execution and delivery 
the timing between initial customer contact and fulfillment of criteria for revenue recognition can be lengthy and unpredictable  and revenues in any given quarter can be adversely affected as a result of such unpredictability 
in the event of any downturn in potential customers businesses or the economy in general  planned purchases of the company s products may be deferred or canceled  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the license of the company s software generally requires the company to engage in a sales cycle that typically takes approximately six to nine months to complete 
the length of the sales cycle may vary depending on a number of factors over which the company may have little or no control  including the size of the transaction and the level of competition which the company encounters in its selling activities 
during the sales cycle  the company typically provides a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of the company s products 
any delay in the sales cycle of a large license or a number of smaller licenses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality 
the company s revenues and operating results in its december quarter typically benefit from purchase decisions made by the large concentration of customers with calendar year end budgeting requirements  while revenues and operating results in the march quarter typically benefit from the efforts of the company s sales force to meet fiscal year end sales quotas 
in addition  the company is currently attempting to expand its presence in international markets  including europe  the pacific rim  and latin america 
international revenues comprise a significant percentage of the company s total revenues  and the company may experience additional variability in demand associated with seasonal buying patterns in such foreign markets 
integration of innovative tech systems into psi s business 
our acquisition of innovative  which was completed in july  will require continuing integration of innovative into psi 
prior to the acquisition  innovative and psi were two geographically separated companies that had been operated independently 
we believe that the acquisition of innovative will further our strategy to provide customers with a complete infrastructure management software solution 
however  difficulties may be encountered in integrating the product offerings  operations and technology of innovative with those of psi 
we may not be able to successfully complete technology development or market new products currently in development or develop any new products that relate to the innovative products 
anticipated marketing  distribution  or other operational benefits and efficiencies from the acquisition of innovative may not be achieved 
the morale of psi and innovative employees may be adversely affected as a result of the acquisition and the resulting integration 
integrating innovative into our existing business may prove difficult given that the two companies are geographically separated  have different corporate cultures and have personnel with different business backgrounds 
we may not be able to retain a sufficient number of innovative s key employees 
additionally  we may have problems combining the engineering teams from innovative with our existing teams so that such teams will successfully cooperate and realize any technological benefits from the combined businesses 
sales of innovative products may not be markedly enhanced by the broader distribution and marketing opportunities available through psi 
we may not be able to benefit from the broader product offerings available as a result of the acquisition or from any other anticipated benefits 
any failure to integrate the businesses and technologies of the companies successfully or any failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  if our management devotes too much time and attention to the integration of innovative into our existing business  this also could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if a significant number of innovative customers or potential customers cancel or do not renew their arrangements with innovative or psi or delay their orders of our products  this could have materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we expect any such affects to be felt most strongly in near term quarters 
risks associated with psi acquisitions 
since september we have completed five acquisitions 
in the future psi may make acquisitions of  or large investments in  other businesses that offer products  services  and technologies that further our goal of providing integrated infrastructure management software solutions to businesses 
our past acquisitions and any future acquisitions or investments that psi were to complete present risks commonly encountered with these types of transactions 
the following are examples of such risks difficulty in combining the technology  operations  or work force of the acquired business disruption of our on going businesses difficulty in realizing the potential financial and strategic position of psi through the successful integration of the acquired business difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies possible impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel difficulty in adding significant numbers of new employees  including training  evaluation  coordination of effort of all employees towards our corporate mission diversion of management attention difficulty in obtaining preferred acquisition accounting treatment for these types of transactions  likelihood that future acquisitions will require purchase accounting resulting in increased intangible assets and goodwill  substantial amortizaiton of such assets and goodwill  and a negative impact on our reported earnings potential dilutive effect on our earnings the risks described above  either individually or in the aggregate  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we expect that future acquisitions  if any  could provide for consideration to be paid in cash  shares of psi common stock  or a combination of cash and psi common stock 
however  we may not be able to complete any such additional acquisitions in the future 
product concentration 
the company currently derives substantially all of its license revenues from the sale of its infrastructure management applications and expects them to account for a significant portion of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
the company s future operating results are dependent upon continued market acceptance of its infrastructure management applications  including future enhancements 
factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for  or market acceptance of the company s infrastructure management applications  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
dependence on market acceptance of infrastructure management software solutions 
until recently  the company s product strategy has focused on integrating a broad array of it management applications with other traditional internal help desk applications to create an enterprise service desk capable of managing multiple aspects of an enterprise s it structure 
in recent years  the company has broadened its product line beyond traditional it infrastructure management to offer a more comprehensive product suite capable of managing a business enterprise s it infrastructure  physical plant and facilities  communications infrastructure  distribution systems  and fleets 
in recent years  the market for enterprise software solutions has been characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product announcements and introductions  and evolving industry standards 
in response to advances in technology  customer requirements have become increasingly complex  resulting in industry consolidation of product lines offering similar or related functionality 
in particular  the company believes that a market for integrated enterprise wide infrastructure management solutions  including applications for it management  asset management  building and facilities management  communications resource management  distribution systems management  and fleet management  is evolving from existing requirements for specific it management solutions 
however  the existence of such a market is unproven 
if such a market does not fully develop  this would have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
regardless of the development of a market for integrated infrastructure management solutions  factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for  or market acceptance of one or more of the company s infrastructure management applications  or if the acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
as a result of rapid technology change in our industry  our position in existing markets or other markets that we may enter can be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate 
our growth and future financial performance depends in part upon our ability to improve existing products  develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer needs  and respond to competitive products 
our product development efforts will continue to require substantial investments 
we may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service of its senior management and certain other key employees of the company  including selected sales  consulting  technical and marketing personnel 
few of the company s employees  including its senior management  are bound by an employment or noncompetition agreement 
in addition  the company does not generally maintain key man life insurance on any employee 
the loss of the services of one or more of the company s executive officers or key employees or the decision of one or more of such officers or employees to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
ability to recruit personnel 
executive officers and key personnel 
our future success will likely depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled technical  sales  management  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense  and in the past we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
new employees generally require substantial training in the use of our products 
we may not succeed in attracting and retaining such personnel 
if we do not  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
foreign employees 
to achieve our business objectives we must be able to recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries 
any future shortage of qualified technical personnel who are either united states citizens or otherwise eligible to work in the united states could increase our reliance on foreign professionals 
many technology companies have already begun to experience shortages of such personnel 
any failure to attract and retain qualified personnel as necessary  including as a result of limitations imposed by federal immigration laws and the availability of visas issued thereunder  could materially adversely affect our business and operating results 
foreign computer professionals such as those employed by us typically become eligible for employment in the united states by obtaining a nonimmigrant visas 
the number of nonimmigrant visas is limited by federal immigration law 
currently  congress is considering approving an increase in the number of visas available 
we cannot predict whether such legislation will ultimately become law 
we also cannot predict what effect any future changes in the federal immigration laws will have on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
competition 
the market for our products is highly competitive and diverse 
the technology for infrastructure management software products can change rapidly 
new products are frequently introduced and existing products are continually enhanced 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
existing competition 
we have faced competition from a number of sources  including providers of internal help desk software applications such as remedy corporation and software artistry  inc now a division of tivoli systems  inc customer interaction software companies such as clarify inc and the vantive corporation  whose products include internal help desk applications information technology and systems management companies such as ibm  computer associates international  inc  network associates  inc recently formed as a result of the business combination of mcafee associates  inc and network general corporation  and hewlett packard company through its acquisition of prolin providers of asset management and facilities management software the internal information technology departments of those companies with infrastructure management needs future competition 
because competitors can easily penetrate the software market  we anticipate additional competition from other established and new companies as the market for enterprise infrastructure management applications develops 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may in the future establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
large software companies may acquire or establish alliances with smaller competitors of psi 
we expect that the software industry will continue to consolidate 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
our ability to sell our products depends in part on their compatibility with and support by providers of system management products  including tivoli  computer associates  and hewlett packard 
both tivoli and hewlett packard have recently acquired providers of help desk software products 
these providers of system management products may decide to close their systems to competing vendors like psi 
they may also decide to bundle their infrastructure management and or help desk software products with other products for enterprise licenses for promotional purposes or as part of a long term pricing strategy 
if that were to happen  our ability to sell our products could be adversely affected 
increased competition may result from acquisitions of help desk and other infrastructure management software vendors by system management companies 
the results of increased competition including price reductions of our products  reduced gross margins  and reduction of market share  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
general competition 
some of our current and many of our potential competitors have much greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than psi 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products than we can 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures faced by psi may materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
management of growth 
we have grown greatly in recent periods  with total revenues increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal if we achieve our growth plans  including the integration of apsylog  innovative  and the technology acquired from iss  such growth may burden our operating and financial systems 
this burden will require large amounts of senior management attention and will require the use of other psi resources 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth and our future operating results will depend in part on our ability to implement and expand operational  customer support  and financial control systems and to expand  train  and manage our employees 
in particular  in connection with the acquisitions  we will be required to integrate additional personnel and to augment or replace existing financial and management systems 
such integration could disrupt our operations and could adversely affect our financial results 
we may not be able to augment or improve existing systems and controls or implement new systems and controls in response to future growth  if any 
any failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
capital commitment 
in june  we entered into a series of leases providing approximately  square feet of office space  including an option for approximately  square feet of space 
even excluding the exercise of the option  the leases require minimum lease payments of approximately million over the terms of the leases  approximately twelve years 
this office space is intended for a five building including the option campus setting in san diego  ca 
construction has commenced on the first building and the final building is scheduled for delivery in the capital commitments  construction oversight  and moving of personnel and facilities involved in a transaction of this type and magnitude present numerous risks involving estimation of future events  including growth of our business  and execution of the transaction 
examples of the risks involved include failure to properly estimate the growth of our business in the future  inability to sublease excess office space that may result  disruption of operations  and inability to match substantially fixed lease payments with fluctuating revenues 
expansion of distribution channels 
we sell our products through our direct sales force and a limited number of distributors and we provide maintenance and support services through our technical and customer support staff 
we plan to continue to invest large amounts of resources to our direct sales force  particularly in north america where we have recently opened several new sales offices 
in addition  we are developing additional sales and marketing channels through system integrators and original equipment manufacturers and other channel partners 
we may not be able to attract channel partners that will be able to market our products effectively or that will be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
if we establish distribution through such indirect channels  our agreements with channel partners may not be exclusive 
as a result  such channel partners may also carry competing product lines 
if we do not establish and maintain such distribution relationships  this could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
international operations 
international sales represented approximately of our total revenue both in fiscal and fiscal we currently have international sales offices in amsterdam  copenhagen  frankfurt  london  paris  and sydney 
our continued growth and profitability will require continued expansion of our international operations  particularly in europe  latin america  and the pacific rim 
accordingly  we intend to expand our current international operations and enter additional international markets 
such expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally  including the following fluctuations in currency exchange rates longer payment cycles difficulties in staffing and managing international operations problems in collecting accounts receivable seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world increases in tariffs  duties  price controls  or other restrictions on foreign currencies trade barriers imposed by foreign countries these factors could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we have only limited experience in developing local language versions of our products and marketing and distributing its products internationally 
we may not be able to successfully translate  market  sell and deliver our products internationally 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
recent instability in the asian pacific economies and financial markets could adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition in future quarters as well 
currency fluctuation 
a large portion of our business is conducted in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar have caused and will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
we may experience currency losses in the future 
we currently maintain a foreign exchange hedging program  consisting principally of purchases of one month forward rate currency contracts 
however  our hedging activities may not adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
issues related to the european monetary conversion 
on january   certain member states of the european economic community the eec fixed their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro 
on that date  the euro became a functional legal currency within these countries 
during the three years beginning on january   business in these eec member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency  such as the french franc or deutsche mark  and the euro 
companies operating in or conducting business in eec member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling the existing currencies  as well as the euro 
our assetcenter product was originally developed for the european market and is capable of managing currency data measured in euros 
we are still assessing the impact that the euro will have on our internal systems and our other products 
we will take corrective actions based on the results of such assessment 
we have not yet determined the costs related to this problem 
issues related to the introduction of the euro may materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
control by existing stockholders 
based on shares outstanding as of may   psi s officers  directors  and entities directly related to such individuals together beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of psi common stock 
in particular  john j 
moores  chairman of psi s board of directors  owns approximately of the outstanding shares 
as a result  psi s officers and directors will be able to control most matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  consolidations  and sales of all or substantially all of the assets of psi 
such concentrated share ownership may prevent or discourage potential bids to acquire psi unless the terms of acquisition are approved by such officers and directors 
product development delays 
we have experienced product development delays in the past and may experience delays in the future 
difficulties in product development could delay or prevent the successful introduction or marketing of new or improved products 
any such new or improved products may not achieve market acceptance 
our current or future products may not conform to industry requirements 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely manner  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
because our software products are complex  these products may contain errors that could be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
in the past we have discovered software errors in certain of our products and have experienced delays in shipment of our products during the period required to correct these errors 
despite testing by psi and by current and potential customers  errors in our products may be found in the future 
detection of such errors may result in  among other things  loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs 
if any of these results were to occur  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
dependence on proprietary technology 
our success will be heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
such laws provide only limited protection 
despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in particular  we may provide our licensees with access to our data model and other proprietary information underlying our licensed applications 
such means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
additionally  our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology 
policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and  while we do not expect software piracy to be a persistent problem  some foreign laws do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as united states laws 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources to psi and could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
risks of infringement 
while we are not aware that any of our software product offerings infringes the proprietary rights of third parties  third parties may claim infringement with respect to our current or future products 
we expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
as a result  infringement claims could have a material adverse affect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
product liability 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit exposure to potential product liability claims 
such limitation of liability provisions may  however  not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims 
we may be subject to such claims in the future 
a product liability claim could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
undesignated preferred stock 
psi s board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
the board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges  and restrictions of such preferred stock without any further vote or action by psi s stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock allows psi to have flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
however  the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by the psi stockholders 
as a result  the market price of the psi common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of psi common stock may be adversely affected 
the issuance of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to others 
psi has no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock 
charter provisions 
certain provisions of psi s charter documents eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting and specify certain procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings 
such provisions are intended to increase the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the psi board of directors and in the policies set by the board 
these provisions also discourage certain types of transactions which may involve an actual or threatened change of control transaction 
these provisions are designed to reduce the vulnerability of psi to an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
as a result  these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
these provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights 
however  they could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for psi s shares 
as a result  these provisions may prevent the market price of psi common stock from reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also prevent changes in the management of psi 
antitakeover effects of delaware law 
psi is subject to the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
the delaware law prevents certain delaware corporations  including psi  from engaging  under certain circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
for purposes of delaware law  a business combination includes  among other things  a merger or consolidation involving psi and the interested stockholder and the sale of more than of psi s assets 
in general  delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of a company and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person 
under delaware law  a delaware corporation may opt out of the antitakeover provisions 
psi has not opted out of the antitakeover provisions of delaware law 
volatility of trading prices 
we completed the initial public offering of psi common stock in april prior to april no public market existed for psi common stock 
in the past  the market price of psi common stock has varied greatly and the volume of psi common stock traded has fluctuated greatly as well 
we expect such fluctuation to continue 
the fluctuation result due to a number of factors including any shortfall in revenues or net income from revenues or net income expected by securities analysts announcements of new products by psi or our competitors quarterly fluctuations in our financial results or the results of other software companies  including those of our direct competitors changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  the financial performance of our competitors  or the financial performance of software companies in general general conditions in the software industry changes in prices for our products or the products of our competitors changes in our revenue growth rates or the growth rates of our competitors sales of large blocks of the psi common stock conditions in the financial markets in general in addition  the stock market may from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many technology companies in particular have experienced such fluctuations 
often such fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
the market prices of psi s common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future 
rapid technological change and product development risks 
the markets for the company s products are subject to rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
as a result  the company s position in its existing markets or other markets that it may enter could be eroded rapidly by product advances 
the life cycles of the company s products are difficult to estimate 
the company s growth and future financial performance will depend in part upon its ability to enhance existing applications  develop and introduce new applications that keep pace with technological advances  meet changing customer requirements and respond to competitive products 
the company s product development efforts are expected to continue to require substantial investments 
there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to make the necessary investments 
the company has in the past experienced development delays  and there can be no assurance that the company will not experience such delays in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such products will achieve market acceptance  or that the company s current or future products will conform to industry requirements 
the inability of the company  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company 
software products as complex as those offered by the company may contain errors that may be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
the company has in the past discovered software errors in certain of its products and has experienced delays in shipment of products during the period required to correct these errors 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found  resulting in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance and sales  diversion of development resources  injury to their reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company
