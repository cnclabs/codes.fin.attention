item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general extended stay america  inc was organized on january  as a delaware corporation to develop  own  and operate extended stay lodging facilities 
studio plus hotels  inc was formed in december and acquired all of the assets of the sph predecessor entities  which owned and operated studioplus tm extended stay facilities since the acquisition of the interests of the sph predecessor entities was accounted for as if it were a pooling of interests 
on april   we completed a merger with sph 
the  shares of sph common stock that were outstanding on the closing date were converted into  shares of our common stock and options to purchase  shares of sph common stock were converted into options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
as a result of the merger  sph became one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
our accompanying consolidated financial statements give effect to the merger  which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we own and operate three brands in the extended stay lodging market studioplus tm hotels  extended stayamerica efficiency studios  and crossland economy studiossm 
each brand is designed to appeal to different price points below per week 
all three brands offer the same core components a living sleeping area  a fully equipped kitchen or kitchenette  and a bathroom 
extended stay rooms are designed to compete in the economy category 
crossland rooms are typically smaller than extended stay rooms and are targeted for the budget category  and studioplus facilities serve the mid price category and generally feature larger guest rooms  an exercise room  and a swimming pool 
the table below provides a summary of our selected development and operational results for   and year ended december  total facilities open at period end total facilities developed total facilities acquired average occupancy rate average weekly room rate average occupancy rates are determined by dividing the rooms occupied on a daily basis by the total number of rooms 
due to our rapid expansion  our overall average occupancy rate has been negatively impacted by the lower occupancy typically experienced during the pre stabilization period for newly opened facilities 
we expect the negative impact on overall average occupancy to decline as the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties in operation declines 
average weekly room rates are determined by dividing room revenue by the number of rooms occupied on a daily basis for the applicable period and multiplying by seven 
the average weekly room rates are generally greater than standard room rates because of i stays of less than one week  which are charged at a higher nightly rate  ii higher weekly rates for rooms that are larger than the standard rooms  and iii additional charges for more than one person per room 
we expect that our future occupancy and room rates will be impacted by a number of factors  including the number and geographic location of new facilities as well as the season in which we open those facilities 
we also cannot assure you that we can maintain our occupancy and room rates 
the following is a summary of the our development status as of december   by brand 
we expect to complete the construction of the facilities currently under construction generally within the next twelve months  however  we cannot assure you that we will complete construction within the time periods we have historically experienced 
our ability to complete construction may be materially impacted by various factors including final permitting and obtaining certificates of occupancy  as well as weather induced construction delays 
extended crossland stay studioplus total operating facilities facilities under construction results of operations compared to property operations the following is a summary of the number of properties in operation at the end of each year along with the related average occupancy rates and average weekly room rates during each year year ended year ended december  december  average average average weekly average weekly facilities occupancy room facilities occupancy room open rate rate open rate rate crossland extended stay studioplus total the average occupancy rate in for the properties that we owned and operated as of january  was 
because newly opened properties typically experience lower occupancies during their pre stabilization period  average occupancy rates are impacted by the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties 
a total of properties commenced operations in compared to properties that were opened in for the extended stay brand  occupancy rates increased for as compared to primarily due to a decrease in the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties for that brand 
occupancy rates decreased for the crossland brand primarily due to an increase in the number of newly opened properties for that brand 
occupancy rates for the studioplus brand were also diluted by an increase in the number of newly opened properties for that brand 
in addition  the studioplus properties opened before experienced average declines in occupancy of approximately five percentage points 
we believe that this decline was due to a number of factors  including primarily a change in the pricing policies for the studioplus brand during to eliminate certain rate discounts  changes in personnel as a result of management restructuring following the merger with sph  and additional competition from new properties that we and our competitors have opened in the markets served by these properties 
we do not expect that the majority of our properties will experience similar conditions 
the increase in overall average weekly room rates for compared to reflects the geographic dispersion of properties opened during and the higher standard weekly room rates in certain of those markets 
the increase also is due in part to increases in rates charged in previously opened properties 
the average weekly room rate for the properties that we owned and operated throughout both periods increased by in these increases were partially offset by an increase in the percentage of total facilities as of the end of the year represented by lower priced extended stay and crossland facilities 
this percentage increased to for from for we expect our overall average weekly room rate will continue to be impacted as extended stay and crossland facilities increase as a percentage of our total facilities 
we recognized total revenue for and of million and million  respectively 
this is an increase of million or 
approximately million of the increased revenue was attributable to properties that we opened during and  and approximately million was attributable to an increase in revenue for the properties that we owned and operated throughout both periods 
property operating expenses  consisting of all expenses directly allocable to the operation of the facilities but excluding any allocation of corporate operating and property management expenses  depreciation  or interest were million of total revenue for compared to million of total revenue for the decrease in property operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for as compared to was primarily a result of a decrease in the ratio of newly opened properties to total properties 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue generally decline as a newly opened property increases its occupancy and revenue because the majority of these expenses do not vary based on occupancy 
as a result  we realized property operating margins of for and for the provisions for depreciation and amortization for our lodging facilities of million for and million for were computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
these provisions reflect a pro rata allocation of the annual depreciation and amortization charge for the periods for which the facilities were in operation 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for as compared to is because we opened additional properties in and we operated for a full year the properties opened in corporate operations corporate operating and property management expenses include all expenses not directly related to the development or operation of the lodging facilities 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel  travel  and certain marketing costs  as well as development costs that are not directly related to a site that we will develop 
we incurred corporate operating and property management expenses of million of total revenue in and million of total revenue in the increase in the amount of these expenses for as compared to reflects the impact of additional personnel and related expenses in connection with the increased number of facilities we operated and sites we developed 
we expect these expenses will continue to increase in total amount but decline as a percentage of revenue as we develop and operate additional facilities in the future 
depreciation and amortization in the amount of million for and million for were computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for assets not directly related to the operation of our facilities 
these assets were primarily office furniture and equipment 
we realized million of interest income during and million during this interest income was primarily attributable to the temporary investment of funds drawn under our credit facilities and funds received from an offering of common stock in the decrease in interest income for as compared to was due to the decrease in our average cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of our continued investments in property and equipment during we incurred interest charges of million during and million during of these amounts  million during and million during was capitalized and included in the cost of buildings and improvements 
we recognized income tax expense of million of income before taxes for and million of income before taxes for our income tax expense differs from the federal income tax rate of primarily due to state and local income taxes and  for  due to permanent tax differences relating to merger expenses and tax exempt interest income 
we expect that our annualized effective income tax rate for will be approximately 
merger  financing  and other charges our normal operating procedures call for us to invest varying amounts in our sites under option in terms of earnest money which would be applied to the purchase of a site  but that in certain circumstances may not be refundable  legal  environmental  engineering  and architectural outlays needed to determine the feasibility of acquiring a site and constructing a hotel on that site  and salaries  wages  and travel costs of our personnel related to the sites 
we capitalize these expenses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in the quarter ended september   we announced a reduction in our development plans for and as a result of unfavorable capital market conditions 
this meant that certain sites we had under option would not be developed 
as a result  we established a valuation allowance of million for the write off of expenses related to these sites 
this resulted in a corresponding expense during the quarter ended september  at december   a total of million of those costs  including  in termination payments to employees  had been charged against the allowance and million was included in other current liabilities 
we believe that these charges are non recurring in nature and will not affect the future results of operations

this is an increase of million or 
approximately million of the increased revenue was attributable to properties that we opened or acquired during and  and approximately  was attributable to an increase in revenue for the properties that we owned and operated throughout both periods 
property operating expenses were million of total revenue for  compared to million of total revenue for the increase in property operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue for as compared to was primarily a result of the lower occupancies and revenue during the pre stabilization period for the properties that commenced operations during as a result  we realized property operating margins of for and for the provisions for depreciation and amortization for our lodging facilities were million for and million for the increase in depreciation and amortization for as compared to is because we opened additional properties in and we operated for a full year the properties opened or acquired in corporate operations we incurred corporate operating and property management expenses of million of total revenue in and million of total revenue in the increase in the amount of these expenses for as compared to reflects the impact of additional personnel and related expenses in connection with the increased number of facilities we operated and sites we developed 
depreciation and amortization for assets not directly related to the operation of our facilities was million for and  for we realized million of interest income during and million during this interest income was primarily attributable to the investment of funds received from offerings of common stock 
the decrease in interest income for as compared to was due to the decrease in our average cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of our continued investments in property and equipment during we incurred interest charges of million during and  during  substantially all of which was capitalized and included in the cost of buildings and improvements 
we recognized income tax expense of million of income before taxes for and million of income before taxes for our income tax expense differs from the federal income tax rate of primarily due to state and local income taxes and  for  due to permanent tax differences relating to merger expenses and tax exempt interest income 
merger  financing  and other charges during  we recorded merger  financing  and other charges totaling million 
these pre tax charges consisted of i million of merger expenses and costs associated with the integration of sph s operations following the merger  ii the write off of million of deferred costs associated with two mortgage loan facilities  which were terminated upon execution of a revolving credit facility  and iii a charge of  in connection with moving the listing of our common stock to the nyse from the national market tier of the nasdaq stock market 
we believe that these charges are non recurring in nature and will not affect the future results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we had net cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  and million as of december  at december   we had invested approximately million in short term demand notes having credit ratings of a pl or equivalent using domestic commercial banks and other financial institutions 
we did not have these investments as of december  we also deposited excess funds during these periods in an overnight sweep account with a commercial bank which in turn invested those funds in short term  interest bearing reverse repurchase agreements 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we did not take possession of the securities  which were instead held by the financial institutions 
the market value of the securities held pursuant to these arrangements approximates the carrying amount 
deposits in excess of  are not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
during  sph temporarily invested proceeds from an offering of its common stock in investments with maturities greater than days 
these investments were in a mutual fund primarily in municipal bonds and in united states government obligations and have been classified as investments available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
in  purchases of these investments available for sale aggregated million and proceeds from the sale or maturity of these investments aggregated million 
our operating activities generated cash of million in  million in  and million in we used million to acquire land and develop and furnish sites opened or under construction in  million for sites in  and million for sites in we also acquired ten existing extended stay facilities in those facilities were paid for by the issuance of common stock valued at million and the payment of million in cash 
our cost to develop a property varies significantly by brand and by geographic location due to differences in land and labor costs 
similarly  the average weekly rate charged and the resultant cash flow from these properties will vary significantly but generally are expected to be in proportion to the development costs 
for the properties we opened from january  through december   the average development cost was approximately million with an average of rooms 
in  we expect to open a number of properties in the northeast and west where average development costs are higher 
accordingly  we expect our average development cost for to increase to approximately million per property 
we received net proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase common stock and from offerings of common stock totaling million in  million in  and million in in  we also made open market repurchases of  shares of common stock for approximately million 
in may  sph entered into a million revolving credit agreement to fund future development and construction of additional hotels and for working capital 
in february  sph increased this line of credit to million  maturing in during  sph received proceeds of million and made payments of million on its line of credit  which was terminated upon consummation of the merger with us in in september  we executed an agreement with various banks establishing a credit facility that provided for up to million of revolving loans on a senior collateralized basis that had a maturity of december  to be used for general corporate purposes  including the construction and acquisition of extended stay properties 
upon entering into the revolving credit facility  we terminated two mortgage loan facilities  which had provided for an aggregate of million in mortgage loans 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million at that time  which represented the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the mortgage loan facilities 
in march we amended the revolving credit facility and  as amended  it became the credit facility 
the credit facility was again amended in september and december the credit facility provides for a million revolving loan facility the revolving facility  a million term loan facility the tranche a facility  a million term loan facility the tranche b facility  and a million term loan facility the tranche c facility 
as of december   we had outstanding loans of million under the revolving facility  million under the tranche a facility and million under the tranche b facility 
at least million of loans must be outstanding under the revolving facility on the date any term loans under the tranche c facility are funded 
loans under the credit facility bear interest  at the our option  at either a prime based rate base rate or a libor based rate eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is an annual rate that fluctuates based on our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit facility 
the applicable margin for the various loan facilities in the credit facility are shown in the table below base rate eurodollar rate revolving facility tranche a facility tranche b facility tranche c facility the loans under the revolving facility and the tranche a facility mature on december  the loans under the tranche b facility and the tranche c facility mature on december  and  respectively  but are subject to principal payments of of the initial loan amounts in each of the years through for the tranche b facility and through for the tranche c facility 
the remaining balances must be repaid in four equal quarterly installments in the years of maturity 
our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries 
they are also collateralized by a first priority lien on all stock of our subsidiaries and all other current and future assets owned by us and our subsidiaries other than mortgages on our real property 
the credit facility contains a number of negative covenants  including  among others  covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  make investments  pay dividends  prepay other indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  make capital expenditures  acquire or dispose of assets  or engage in mergers or acquisitions 
in addition  the credit facility contains affirmative covenants  including  among others  covenants that require us to maintain our corporate existence  comply with laws  maintain our properties and insurance  and deliver financial and other information to the lenders 
the credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial tests and to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes the notes 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semiannually on march and september of each year and mature on march  we may redeem the notes beginning on march  the initial redemption price is of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the redemption price declines each year after and is of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  after in addition  before march   we may redeem up to million of the notes  using the proceeds from certain sales of our stock  at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the notes are uncollateralized and are subordinated to all of our senior indebtedness including the credit facility  and contain certain covenants for the benefit of the holders of the notes 
these covenants  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make investments and other restricted payments  enter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates  create liens  and sell assets 
we had commitments totaling approximately million at december  to complete construction of extended stay properties 
we believe that the remaining availability under the credit facility  together with cash on hand and cash flows from operations  will provide sufficient funds to develop the properties we currently plan to open in and to fund our operating expenses through we expect we will continue to rapidly expand our operations 
beginning in  we plan to open properties with total costs of approximately million per year 
we expect to finance this development with internally generated cash flows and increases in our debt facilities 
the timing and amount of financing we will need will depend on a number of factors  including the number of properties we construct or acquire  the timing of that development  and the cash flow generated by our properties 
also  if capital markets provide favorable opportunities  our plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  our existing sources of funds prove to be insufficient to fund our growth and operations  or if we consummate acquisitions  we may seek additional capital sooner than currently anticipated 
sources of financing may include public or private debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
our failure to raise additional capital could result in the delay or abandonment of some or all of our development and expansion plans  and could have a material adverse effect on the company 
impact of the year issue and accounting releases the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
based on our assessment  we do not anticipate that any significant modification or replacement of our hardware or software will be necessary for our computer systems to properly use dates beyond december  or that we will incur significant operating expenses to make any such computer system improvements 
we are undertaking an assessment as to whether any of our significant suppliers  lenders  or service providers will need to make any such software modifications or replacements 
while we do not expect the failure of any third parties to address the year issue to uniquely impact our business  we could be adversely affected should the availability of electricity  gas  water  and telephone services be interrupted 
in addition  we could be adversely affected if other businesses are impacted by the year issue to the extent that business related travel is reduced significantly or in the event that our employees are unable to fulfill their responsibilities 
we do not expect these pervasive failures to result from the year issue  however  we cannot give you any assurance that these problems will not arise 
in april  the accounting standards executive committee released statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities sop 
sop requires that start up costs  including pre opening and organizational costs be expensed as incurred and is effective for financial statements issued for periods beginning after december  at december   we had unamortized pre opening and organization costs of approximately million 
under sop  we would have reported an increase in expenses of approximately  for seasonality and inflation based upon the operating history of our facilities  we believe that extended stay lodging facilities are not as seasonal in nature as the overall lodging industry 
we do expect  however  that our occupancy rates and revenues will be lower than average during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year 
because many of our expenses do not fluctuate with changes in occupancy rates  declines in occupancy rates may cause fluctuations or decreases in our quarterly earnings 
the rate of inflation as measured by changes in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on our revenue or operating results during any of the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that inflation will not affect our future operating or construction costs
