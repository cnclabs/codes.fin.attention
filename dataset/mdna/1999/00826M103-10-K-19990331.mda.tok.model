item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company was formed in to develop and market technologies that enable financial institutions and other businesses to provide consumer financial services electronically with reduced or no human intervention 
from the period of inception january  through december   the company was a development stage company  and its activities principally related to developing its decisys rt technology formerly known as the dss system and the affinity alm  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
until early the company s primary products and services consisted of the alm  which captures origination information for unsecured consumer loan applications and then routes this information to the company s proprietary decisys rt for an automated decision  and a call center decisioning system that provided financial institutions with the ability to originate unsecured consumer loans with reduced or no human intervention 
during  the company developed e xpertlender  which connects the company s automated decisioning system with a financial institution s delivery channels  and its risk management group and gives the consumer a choice of closing methods that include branches  alms  mail  and third party closing agents 
during  the company began developing a system to process automobile loans pursuant to a development contract with citibank 
the company is currently developing a generic automobile loan processing system to be sold  under the brand name of ideal  to other financial institutions 
during  the company committed significant development and other internal resources to enhancing its e xpertlender product and fulfilling its obligations under its citibank contract 
as a result  the company was unable to  and did not  devote significant resources to the development  sales and marketing of any of its other products and services 
the company deployed only one alm during  and alms deployed before have generally not met the expectations of the company s customers 
to date  the company has generated substantial operating losses and experienced an extremely lengthy sales cycle for its products 
average consumer use of alms in service and average rates of loan approvals have been lower than most customer expectations 
the company believes that the economic viability of the alm as an alternative to traditional and new lending methods has not yet been established  and several of the company s alm customers have terminated their relationship with the company 
at december   there were alms in operation 
although the company has developed and is developing other products and services to exploit its decisys rt technology  to date such products and services have not generated substantial revenues  and the company has been required to use a substantial amount of existing cash resources to fund its operations 
although the company believes that existing cash  cash equivalents and internally generated funds will be sufficient to fund operations through  such resources  together with projected revenues that may be received under existing contracts  will be insufficient to fund the company s operations in and beyond 
to remain viable after  the company must substantially increase revenues  raise additional capital and or substantially reduce its operations 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to increase its revenues  raise additional capital or reduce its operations in a manner that allows it to continue operations in and beyond 
to date  the company has generated minimal operating revenues  has incurred significant losses and has experienced substantial negative cash flow from operations 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly technology based companies operating in unproven markets with unproven products 
the company had an accumulated deficit as of december  of  with operating losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company expects to incur substantial additional costs to develop its financial product origination capabilities  to enhance and market ideal  e xpertlender  the alm and decisys rt and to complete any new products and services that may be developed 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will ever be able to achieve profitability or  if achieved  sustain such profitability 
the market for the company s products and services is new  evolving and uncertain  and it is difficult to determine the size and predict the future growth rate  if any  of this market 
in addition  the market for products and services that enable electronic commerce is highly competitive and is subject to rapid innovation and competition from traditional products and services having all or some of the same features as products and services enabling electronic commerce 
competitors in this market have frequently taken different strategic approaches and have launched substantially different products or services in order to exploit the same perceived market opportunity 
until the market has validated a strategy through widespread acceptance of a product or service  it is difficult to identify all current or potential market participants or gauge their relative competitive position 
results of operations revenues 
the company s revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the types of revenue recognized by the company in the years ended december   and are as follows years ended december  of of of amount total amount total amount total transaction fees    mortgage processing fees  initial set up fees    sales and rental fees    professional services fees   other income    license revenue  the nature and types of revenues earned by the company has changed significantly in the three year period ended december  during  the primary source of revenue was from the deployment of alms under sales type leases

the company s revenue plan for is primarily to sell and deploy its products and services into environments which are able to generate significant transaction volume and transaction fees over extended periods of time 
accordingly  the company may elect to forego significant upfront revenue in the form of set up and licensing fees if it believes that the potential exists to recover upfront costs in the form of transaction fees in a reasonable period of time 
transaction fees 
the increase in transaction fees in compared to is attributable primarily to the deployment in mid of the company s first e xpertlender system 
transaction fees processed through such system were generated for the entire year of compared to a shorter period in transaction fees associated with processing credit and debit card transactions through the company s transaction processing division tps decreased slightly from approximately  in to approximately  in the increase in transaction fees in compared to is also attributable primarily to the deployment in mid of the company s first e xpertlender system and to a full year of tps operations in compared to only two months of operations in in december  the company sold tps to a third party 
mortgage processing fees 
surety engages in mortgage brokerage activities which includes originating  processing and selling mortgage loan products to outside investors 
surety originates and processes mortgage loans directly with consumers or on behalf of correspondents  and immediately sells such loans to institutions that sponsor the loan programs offered by surety

mortgage processing fees include gains on sales of mortgage loans to institutions and loan fees received for originating and processing the loan 
loan origination fees and all other direct costs associated with originating loans are recognized at the time the loans are sold 
the company did not generate revenues from mortgage processing services prior to initial set up fees 
set up fees recognized in   and were associated with the deployment of alm  alms  and alms  respectively 
set up fees in also reflected fees deferred in conjunction with services rendered to one customer in which were recognized in upon the decision of the customer not to deploy the company s alms 
the increase in set up fees recognized in compared to is attributable to an increase in the amount of set up fees charged and the short term deployment of alms in early in a pilot program 
the pilot program was terminated after a short period and  accordingly  the set up fees paid by the customer were then recognized 
sales and rental fees 
the decrease in sales and rental revenue in compared to is attributable to a substantial decrease in alm deployments in amounts recognized in also consisted of rental payments received on alms deployed under operating leases in prior years 
in the company recognized sales revenue associated with the deployment of alms under sales type leases as well as rental revenue associated with alms deployed under operating leases 
the decrease in sales and rental revenues in as compared to is attributable to a decrease in the deployment of alms under sales type leases in compared to in the company deployed alms under sales type leases compared to in professional services fees 
when the company agrees to provide professional services to customize its core technology to conform to a specific customer request  the company generally enters into a contract with the customer for the performance of these services which typically defines deliverables  specific delivery and acceptance dates and specified fees for such services 
upon completion and acceptance of the specific deliverables by the customer  the company recognizes the corresponding revenue as professional services revenue 
the level of professional services revenue remained consistent in compared to in both years  professional services revenue related primarily to the customization of the company s e xpertlender system to meet a specific customer s requirements 
such customer represented and of professional services revenue in and  respectively

one other customer accounted for of total revenue during for information relating to customer revenue concentrations for  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements segment information 
the loss of any one of these customers may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations due to the developing nature of the company s customer base and revenue streams 
the company expects that a substantial portion of the company s operating revenues in the future may continue to be attributable to relatively few customers 
such customer concentration may cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly and annual revenues due to the uncertainty of the timing of new and additional orders for the company s products and services 
costs and expenses costs of revenues 
costs of revenues for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
cost of revenues includes the direct costs associated with the generation of specific types of revenue and the allocation of certain indirect costs when such costs are specifically identifiable and allocable to revenue producing activities 
during the two years ended december   the nature and amounts of costs  as well as gross profit margins  associated with certain revenue producing activities varied significantly due to changes in the nature of the services offered by the company and due to different pricing structures offered to certain customers 
costs of revenues and the percentage of the costs of revenues to total costs of revenues for the years ended december   and are as follows years ended december  of of of amount total amount total amount total transaction fees    mortgage processing fees  initial set up fees   sales and rental fees    professional services fees   license revenue  costs of transaction fees

additionally  the costs include direct costs incurred by the company  including shipping costs and amounts paid to third parties 
the company s deployment of alms was insignificant in  and no costs were incurred in in association with initial set up revenue recognized 
the decrease in the costs of set up fee revenue in as compared to is due primarily to the deployment of fewer alms in in the company deployed alms compared to in under both sales type and operating leases 
additionally  the company improved its deployment processes in which resulted in greater cost efficiencies being realized compared to costs of sales and rental fees 
costs of sales and rental fees are primarily related to the costs of alm hardware components associated with alms deployed under sales type leases  maintenance of installed alms and depreciation associated with alms deployed under operating leases 
in the costs of sales and rental revenue of  consisted primarily of depreciation related to alms deployed under operating leases and the costs associated with maintaining the company s installed base of alms 
costs of sales and rental revenues was significantly lower in compared to primarily as a result of the deployment in of alms under sales type leases compared to only alm deployed under a sales type lease in the decrease in the costs of sales and rental revenues in as compared to was primarily the result of fewer alm deployments in compared to when the company deployed alms under sales type leases 
under the terms of an agreement with one customer covering alms  the customer s payment obligation to the company is based on alm performance  which has resulted in revenues insufficient to cover the depreciation expense recognized by the company 
accordingly  the costs of sales and rental revenues exceeded the sales and rental revenues recognized by the company for such contract 
costs of professional services fees

from the time technological feasibility is established until the time the relevant application is available for general release to customers  software development costs incurred are capitalized at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
thereafter  costs related to the application are again expensed as incurred 
capitalized software development costs are amortized using the greater of the revenue curve or straight line method over the estimated economic life of the application 
software costs capitalized include direct labor  other costs directly associated with the development of the related application and an allocation of indirect costs  primarily facility costs and other costs associated with the company s software development staff 
the company bases such allocation on the percentage of the company s total labor costs represented by the software development labor costs 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expense is due to an overall decrease in the number of employees involved in development activities and the progression of certain development activities to a point where the costs of such activities are capitalized pursuant to applicable accounting guidelines during the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  as compared to  is primarily attributable to an increase in the average number of employees involved in development activities in and to the company s continued enhancement of its decisys rt technology and the development of additional financial product origination capabilities in during  and  the company capitalized approximately   and  respectively  of software development costs related primarily to the development of certain financial service applications processed using decisys rt

the decrease in interest income for the year ended december  as compared to  is due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments balances as compared to the same period of and to a lesser extent a decrease in the amount of amortization of deferred interest income associated with alms under sales type lease agreements 
the amount of interest income attributable to short term investments and the amortization of deferred interest was substantially unchanged in as compared to interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to  and for the year ended december  as compared to  is due primarily to payments made under the terms of capital lease obligations 
in addition  the company incurred debt in to fund its operations prior to its initial public offering 
income taxes the company has recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of its net deferred income tax assets as of december    and  based on management s evaluation of the recognition criteria as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no

net proceeds from the company s initial public offering were  the company continues to use a substantial amount of existing cash resources to fund its operations 
if the company continued to use cash resources at the rate used in and  the company would deplete its existing cash resources in the latter part of  however  the company has taken certain measures to reduce its cash depletion rate  including decreasing its employee base 
currently  the company s employee base is approximately less than it was at december  the company believes existing cash  cash equivalents and internally generated funds will be sufficient to meet the company s currently anticipated cash requirements through however no assurances can be given that the company s existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements for moreover  existing cash resources and projected revenues that may be received under existing contracts will be insufficient to fund the company s operations for and thereafter 
accordingly  to remain viable after  the company must substantially increase revenues  raise additional capital and or substantially reduce its operations 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to increase its revenues  raise additional capital or reduce its operations in a manner that would allow it to continue operations in and beyond 
in order to fund operations  the company may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  in which case the percentage ownership of the stockholders of the company will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to the company or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms  the company may be unable to continue operations  develop  enhance and market products  retain qualified personnel  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
net cash used during the year ended december   to fund operations was approximately  compared to approximately  and  for the same periods in and  respectively

these options are exercisable for a day period ending may  the company expects that the former owners of buy american  inc and project freedom  inc 
will elect to exercise their option to sell their stock to the company for an aggregate amount of approximately implications of year issues year issues generally involve the potential impact on a company if computer systems fail to accurately interpret data after december  since many computer programs have historically been designed to read and interpret years in a two digit format  a computer program or system that is not redesigned or otherwise updated may be incapable of distinguishing between the year and the year  which may result in systems failure or the generation of inaccurate data 
the risks associated with year issues are significant due to the reliance of most companies on interaction with automated information or services provided by third parties that may be subject to year issues 
moreover  it is frequently difficult to assess a third party s ability  diligence  and success in addressing year issues 
in many cases  reliance must be placed on representations received from third parties regarding the existence of year issues that may affect the continuity or quality of critical services they provide 
the company s business primarily involves the automated processing of financial service transactions through both internally developed and externally purchased computer software and hardware systems 
additionally  the company is dependent on third parties to deliver certain automated services essential to support the company s internal operations and its ability to process financial services transactions for its customers 
the computer systems used by the company to process financial services transactions are generally interfaced with its customers systems and  accordingly  the company s ability to deliver uninterrupted service may be adversely affected if its customers have not adequately addressed year issues 
the company has undertaken various initiatives to date to address year issues 
such initiatives have included an evaluation of its information technology it  which consists of computer hardware and software  and non information technology non it  which generally includes systems that rely on imbedded chip technology 
the company anticipates that its year assessment  remediation  testing and implementation efforts will be completed by september  the company does not anticipate that any material modification or refinement of its it or non it systems will be necessary to adequately address and resolve year issues  however  failure to identify  assess  remediate  test and implement solutions to year issues could result in a system failure or the use of inaccurate data  which could disrupt the company s operations and adversely affect its ability to provide uninterrupted services to its customers 
the company divided its activities into two categories for purposes of evaluating and tracking issues related to the year services systems are those computer software and hardware systems  including third party services  used to provide processing services for the company s customers 
operations systems are those computer software and hardware systems  including third party services  utilized by the company for internal operating and administrative purposes 
services systems the company s processing services are delivered through alms or web server based systems  both of which are connected to the company s network operating center noc 
the noc uses multiple servers to process financial services transactions and is connected to various third party systems that provide essential information required for the processing of financial services transactions 
such third party services include  but are not limited to  credit bureaus  credit scoring agencies  consumer identification sources and other fraud detection service providers 
moreover  the company s alms and web server based systems are connected to the noc through communications networks and links provided by third parties 
the company s alms  web server based systems and the noc consist of both it and non it systems 
alm systems 
alms are freestanding kiosks that consist of hardware  software and communications systems 
the company s customers have deployed alms to serve as a point of entry for consumer information as well as a delivery vehicle to fulfill financial services transactions 
alm systems  including software applications  hardware and component devices and communications connection to the noc have been tested using certain date testing parameters as follows december   january   february   february   and  march  the company has requested that third party providers of it and non it components and systems used in or in conjunction with the alm systems provide evidence of their system s compliance with year issues 
to date  the company has received no communication that any third party service providers are non compliant with year issues 
evidence supporting compliance has been received from most third parties that provide critical systems or service used in the alm system 
during the course of its evaluation of year issues pertaining to the alm system  the company identified one operating software system that will require an upgrade to remediate year issues 
the company expects that the required upgrades will be completed by september  certain of the company s services are accessed and utilized by external systems of its customers 
the company has published an interface standard for access to its services by these external systems  and the data elements of this interface are year compliant 
this includes the interface to customer created and maintained web pages for providing the company s services using the internet 
web server based systems 
the company also provides service to its customers using web server based systems 
these systems provide access to the company s services through customer maintained computer networks such as call centers and indirect lending operations systems 
the web server based systems access the company s noc through browser based applications which are independent of the operating systems and hardware environments utilized by the company s customers 
as a result  customers must ensure that these operating system and hardware environments are year compliant 
testing of these systems is in process and is expected to be completed along with all necessary remediation by september  completion of the company s year initiatives with respect to its web server based systems is dependent upon completion of year initiatives surrounding testing and implementation of certain third party systems and services 
additionally  web server based systems are connected to the company s noc through dedicated third party communications systems  and the company has received statements from the provider of these communications systems that such systems will operate in the year and beyond 
noc systems 
the company s noc uses multiple servers to enable services provided by its alm and web server based systems 
these servers are interconnected using standard ethernet network facilities using tcp ip protocols 
the company is conducting tests on these servers and their operating systems 
all testing is expected to be completed along with all necessary remediation by september  in addition  the company is in the process of soliciting and receiving statements from the various third party providers of the it and non it components of these server systems regarding compliance with year issues 
the company is dependent on services and systems provided by third parties to maintain continuous and uninterrupted service to its customers 
moreover  the company s ability to fully certify its systems is dependent upon successful implementation of year compliant systems by third party service providers 
the company anticipates that it will complete its assessment of year issues related to third parties by september  the company believes that if certain third parties that provide essential services to the company are unable to demonstrate compliance with year issues  the company can switch to alternative third party service providers and obtain substantially comparable services at substantially the same cost 
operations systems operations systems are those computer hardware and software systems utilized by the company for internal operating and administrative purposes 
certain systems utilized by the company for operating purposes are also dependent on third party service providers  however  to a much lesser extent than the systems utilized by the company to provide services to its customers 
operations systems include  but are not limited to  those systems used for accounting  billing  human resources  payroll  internal communications and management of software resources 
additionally  operations systems include other devices used for ongoing operations such as telephone and pbx systems  personal and network computers and fax machines 
third party services used in the company s internal operations include internet and telephone services and other communications services 
the company is completing its remediation  testing and implementation activities with respect to its operations systems 
during the course of its assessment the company identified one operations system that was not year compliant 
the company anticipates that remediation will be completed by september  operations non it systems may contain imbedded chip technology  which complicates the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts 
based upon its identification and assessment efforts to date  the company believes that no replacement of critical computer equipment or software will be necessary 
in addition  in the ordinary course of replacing computer equipment and software  the company attempts to obtain replacements that are year compliant 
the company is completing its assessment regarding certain non critical operations systems and services provided by third parties 
the assessment of critical operations systems and services by third parties has been completed which generally included obtaining representations that such systems were year compliant 
the company is in the process of soliciting and obtaining representations regarding all other systems and services provided by third parties with respect to year issues 
the company currently does not have sufficient information to ascertain whether all third party system and service providers will be year compliant by september  costs of addressing year issues the automated systems developed by the company and upon which it is primarily dependent to deliver services to its customers were designed and developed in consideration of year issues 
accordingly  the incremental cost associated with addressing year issues in the initial design and development of the company s systems has been insignificant 
similarly  the company s internally developed operating systems have been developed since  and the incremental costs associated with year issues have been insignificant 
the costs associated with year issue assessment  identification  remediation and testing have not been significant  and the company does not believe that significant future costs will be incurred to complete its assessment and remediation of year issues 
risks associated with year issues the company is still evaluating year issues and there can be no assurance that the company will be completely successful in its efforts to assess  identify  remediate and test all year issues including the year issues which may affect critical services supplied by third parties 
if the company is unable to complete its assessment or otherwise improperly assesses or fails to adequately remediate year issues  the company may be unable to provide continuous and uninterrupted services to its customers 
accordingly  the company could suffer the loss of revenue  customers and future sales as well as expose itself to litigation 
similarly  the company may be exposed to the disruption of its business activities and diversion of resources that could materially and adversely affect the operations and activities of the company 
any amount of potential lost revenue or liability related to year issues cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
to address the uncertainty and risks associated with year issues  the company is developing contingency and recovery plans 
such plans are being developed based on an assessment of possible scenarios that may result from year issues and include the possible failure of the company s systems and third party systems and services 
the company anticipates that its planning efforts and development of contingency plans will be complete by september  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk exposure is the potential loss arising from changes in interest rates and its impact on investments and the company s mortgage brokerage business 
the company does not believe such risk is material 
the company s cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less 
at december   short term investments consist of approximately  in a certificate of deposit with a maturity of less than three months and approximately  in us government securities with maturities greater than three months when purchased  which are currently held as available for sale 
further  when the company receives a commitment to originate a mortgage loan from a consumer or correspondent  the company immediately receives a commitment from an investor to buy such mortgage loan 
the company does not believe that its mortgage brokerage business exposes it to significant market risk for changes in interest rates
