inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company in the past three years nor is it expected to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future 
year the year problem is a result of software computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company recognized  that without corrective action  that the risk that its software programs or computer hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or a miscalculation causing disruptions of operations including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company recognized the need to ensure that its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software and hardware failure 
the company developed a plan to ensure that its systems are compliant with the requirements to process transactions in the year that plan consisted of four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation  and encompasses internal information technology it systems and non it systems  as well as third party exposures 
the following is a status report of the company s effort to date the company s state of readiness the company believes that it has completed the assessment  remediation  testing and it systems and non it systems phases 
to the best of its knowledge  management of the company believes that all us and us production systems and networks are yk compliant 
the company retained an outside firm to assist the company s personnel 
it is estimated that the costs of this project are approximately million 
with the exception of these consulting fees  other costs to comply with the year issue have been immaterial 
third parties and their exposure to the year the company has requested from a majority of its principal suppliers and vendors written statements regarding their knowledge of and plans for meeting year requirements 
to date  the company is not aware of any principal supplier or vendor with a year issue that could materially impact the company s results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
however  the company has no means of ensuring that external agents will be year ready 
the company has numerous alternate suppliers that it could utilize in the event of a problem with any particular supplier 
risks management of the company believes that it has an effective program to resolve the year issue 
the company has completed all necessary phases of the year program 
however  there can be no assurance that the company is risk free of the year issue 
principally  certain aspects of the company s operations are dependent on third parties and their ability to meet year requirements 
in addition  disruptions in the economy which could result from the year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time
