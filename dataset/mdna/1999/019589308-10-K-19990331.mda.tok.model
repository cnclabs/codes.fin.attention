item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
introduction the company has experienced significant growth  a substantial portion of which has resulted from the acquisition of solid waste businesses 
since january   the company has completed acquisitions 
in  the company acquired businesses and subsequent to it has acquired businesses 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the acquisition of companies accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
the majority of the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method for business combinations and  accordingly  the results of operations for such acquired businesses are included in the company s financial statements only from the applicable date of acquisition 
as a result  the company believes its historical results of operations for the periods presented are not directly comparable

the transaction is structured as a merger of bfi with a subsidiary of allied and is subject to the approval of bfi stockholders and other customary conditions 
general revenues 
the company s revenues are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
the company s collection services are generally provided under direct agreements with its customers or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
commercial and municipal contract terms  where used  generally range from to years and commonly have automatic renewal options 
the company s landfill operations include both company owned landfills and those operated for municipalities for a fee 
the company is fully integrated in each geographic region in which it is located as it provides collection  transfer and disposal services 
the tables below show for the periods indicated the percentage of the company s total reported revenues attributable to services provided and to geographic region 
the data below have been restated to give effect to acquisitions that were accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations 
year ended december  collection transfer landfill other total revenues year ended december  great lakes midwest northeast southeast southwest west total revenues the portion of collection revenues attributable to disposal charges for waste collected by the company and disposed at the company s landfills have been excluded from collection revenues and included in landfill revenues 
the company s strategy is to develop vertically integrated operations to ensure internalization of the waste it collects and thus realize higher margins from its operations 
by disposing of waste at company owned and or operated landfills  the company retains the margin generated through disposal operations that would otherwise be earned by third party landfills 
approximately of company collected waste is disposed of at company owned and or operated landfills as measured by disposal volumes in in addition  transfer stations are an integral part of the disposal process 
the company locates its transfer stations in areas where its landfills are outside of the population centers in which it collects waste 
such waste is transferred to long haul trailers and economically transported to its landfills 
expenses 
cost of operations includes labor  maintenance and repairs  equipment and facility rent  utilities and taxes  the costs of ongoing environmental compliance  safety and insurance  disposal costs and costs of independent haulers transporting company waste to the disposal site 
disposal costs include certain landfill taxes  host community fees  payments under agreements with respect to landfill sites that are not owned  landfill site maintenance  fuel and other equipment operating expenses and accruals for estimated closure and post closure monitoring expenses anticipated to be incurred in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  sales costs  community relations expenses and provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable and potentially unrealizable market development costs 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of landfill development costs including capitalized interest  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with potential acquisitions  the company incurs and capitalizes certain transaction and integration costs which include stock registration  legal  accounting  consulting  engineering and other direct costs 
when an acquisition is completed and is accounted for using the pooling of interests method for business combinations  these costs are charged to the statement of operations as acquisition related costs 
when a completed acquisition is accounted for using the purchase method for business combinations  these costs are capitalized 
the company routinely evaluates capitalized transaction and integration costs and expenses those costs related to acquisitions not likely to occur 
indirect acquisition costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  construction and permitting costs  are capitalized and amortized based on consumed airspace 
the company believes that the costs associated with engineering  owning and operating landfills will increase in the future as a result of federal  state and local regulation and a growing community awareness of the landfill permitting process 
although there can be no assurance  the company believes that it will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset these increased expenses 
all indirect landfill development costs  such as executive salaries  general corporate overhead  public affairs and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
accrued closure and post closure costs represent an estimate of the present value of the future obligation associated with closure and post closure monitoring of non hazardous solid waste landfills currently owned and or operated by the company 
site specific closure and post closure engineering cost estimates are prepared annually for landfills owned and or operated by the company for which it is responsible for closure and post closure 
the present value of estimated future costs are accrued based on accepted tonnage as landfill airspace is consumed 
discounting of future costs is applied where the company believes that both the amounts and timing of related payments are reliably determinable 
the company periodically updates its estimates of future closure and post closure costs 
the impact of changes which are determined to be changes in estimates are accounted for on a prospective basis 
the net present value of the closure and post closure commitment is calculated assuming inflation of and a risk free capital rate of 
discounted amounts previously recorded are accreted to reflect the effects of the passage of time 
the company s current estimate of total future payments  for closure and post closure is billion  adjusted for inflation  while the present value of such estimate is million 
at december  and  accruals for landfill closure and post closure costs including costs assumed through acquisitions were approximately million and million  respectively 
the accruals reflect relatively young landfills with estimated remaining lives  based on current waste flows  that range from to over years  and an estimated average remaining life of greater than years 
year systems modifications 
certain computer program software has been written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
if left uncorrected  a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations could result 
the company is implementing a formal plan which will require programming modifications to ensure the company s systems will operate properly in the year year 
this plan includes four phases consisting of awareness  assessment and renovation  validation and implementation 
in management s opinion  the scope of year systems modifications will not be extensive and the costs associated with addressing them are not expected to exceed  awareness 
all year projects with respect to internal systems are approved by senior management and evaluated and reviewed by the board of directors as deemed necessary if they are expected to result in material cost 
assessment and renovation 
the assessment and renovation phase of the plan includes both information technology related systems and non information technology areas 
information technology related systems 
to date  the company has assessed all information technology related systems  which includes hardware  applications software  operating systems and databases 
the company s core business systems  including general ledger  accounts payable  fixed assets  customer billing and operations support  function properly with respect to dates in the year non information technology areas 
the company s assessment of year issues will include non information technology areas such as equipment and communications systems 
non information technology systems will be assessed during the second quarter of and  if necessary  a plan for modification will be reviewed for approval by senior management 
in addition  the company is working with outside vendors to determine if their information systems will function in the year the company will monitor this through periodic questionnaires and discussions with suppliers 
validation 
the company successfully validated the modifications made to the customer billing and operations support systems during february of validation included testing and verifying the performance  functionality  and integration of the system after year modifications were made 
implementation 
implementation of the company s plan includes both information technology related systems and non information technology areas 
information technology related systems 
the company has begun implementing modifications to its information systems 
to date  one of the company s six regions has been converted to the modified applications 
the company intends to complete the implementation of all modified information systems  vendor supplied local area network lan applications  and lan operating systems patches by the end of the second quarter of non information technology areas 
the company plans to modify necessary non information technology equipment and systems  establish contingency plans  and update existing disaster recovery plans throughout upon completion of its year plan  the company expects to be year compliant and expects to have no material exposure with respect to information technology related systems 
with respect to non information technology areas  it is uncertain what risks are associated with the year issue and any risks that may be identified could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further  there can be no assurances that the information systems of customers and vendors on which the company relies will be year compliant in a timely manner and will not have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
segment reporting 
effective january   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information statement 
statement superseded fasb statement  financial reporting for segments of a business enterprise 
statement establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
statement also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas  and major customers 
the adoption of statement did not affect results of operations or financial position  but did affect the disclosure of segment information

depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
in addition to the depreciation and amortization of acquired companies  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to a increase in internalized landfill tonnage  a increase in costs in excess of net assets acquired and an increase in capital expenditures 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization did not change significantly 
acquisition related and unusual costs 
during the company recorded acquisition related and unusual charges in the amount of million 
these charges primarily relate to acquisitions accounted for as poolings of interests and consist of transaction and deal costs  employee severance and transition costs  environmental related matters  litigation liabilities  regulatory compliance matters  restructuring and abandonment costs and loss contract provisions 
the company does not anticipate that future costs to be incurred in connection with acquisitions will be significant as restructuring and transition activities have been substantially implemented as of december  the acquisition related and unusual charges consist of the following direct transaction and deal costs of million including investment banker  attorney  accountant  environmental assessment and other third party fees 
approximately million is accrued at december  and is expected to be paid in employee severance and transition costs of million consist of million in termination payments made to employees of acquired companies based on change of control provisions in preexisting contracts and million of costs associated with severance payments under exit or integration plans implemented in connection with acquisitions made during the exit and integration plans call for the termination of a total of approximately employees who have or are currently performing managerial  sales  administrative support  maintenance and repair  or hauling and landfill operations duties 
all employees were identified and notified of their severance or transition benefits at the time management approved the plan  which occurred at or around the time of the acquisitions 
at december   the majority of employees identified have been terminated and approximately million is accrued for benefits remaining to be paid in environmental related matters  litigation liabilities and regulatory compliance matters assumed in acquisitions totaled million 
subsequent to consummating business combinations accounted for as pooling of interests  the company made certain changes in accounting estimates due to events and new information becoming available for environmental liabilities of approximately million  litigation liabilities of approximately million and regulatory compliance liabilities of approximately million 
additional environmental liabilities were accrued based on comprehensive assessments performed by third party and in house engineers of the operating sites owned or used by the acquired companies at the time of acquisition and represent the most probable outcome of these contingent matters 
the change in estimate relating to litigation and regulatory compliance liabilities was accrued based on legal due diligence performed by in house and outside legal counsel of acquired companies at the time of acquisition and the determination of the reasonably probable loss incurred 
at december   approximately million is accrued for environmental matters  which is expected to be disbursed in future periods  and million is accrued for legal and regulatory compliance liabilities to be paid in restructuring and abandonment costs were million 
costs to consolidate or relocate redundant operations and to transition to common information systems were million 
abandonment costs and losses on the disposal of duplicate revenue producing assets relating to specifically identified transfer stations and recycling facilities were million 
additionally  million of costs were incurred for the disposition of redundant non revenue producing assets  including acquired companies corporate and administrative offices 
approximately million of relocation and transition costs remain accrued at december  and are expected to be paid in loss contract provisions were million for losses associated with collection contracts and other contractual obligations assumed in acquisitions 
approximately million remains accrued at december  and is expected to be resolved in asset impairments 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized non cash asset impairment charges aggregating million 
these charges related to assets held for future use and assets to be disposed of in the first and second quarters of an impairment charge of million  with no associated tax benefit  was recorded relating to goodwill of a waste transportation business recorded by a company recently acquired by allied 
in the fourth quarter of  the company lost certain hauling agreements at an operating district in its great lakes region which resulted in a loss of revenues for the district 
upon identifying this event  the company evaluated possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows  before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis  to the net book value of assets 
this comparison indicated that undiscounted cash flows were insufficient to recover assets and further analysis was performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  the company recorded an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their fair market value 
fair market value was determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows over years using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved  which was approximating the company s weighted average cost of capital 
additionally  an impairment charge of million was recorded for the write down to net realizable value less cost of disposal of assets to be sold relating to non core or non integrated operating districts 
the ability to successfully implement the company s integration strategy is a key consideration in determining whether the company will continue in a specific market or exit a market 
in october  the company formalized plans to dispose of certain operating districts considered non core or non integrated assets 
the company has entered into agreements to sell these assets and in accordance with sfas recorded an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the assets to net realizable value including an accrual for the cost of disposal 
the sales are expected to be consummated in the first and second quarters of the results of operations before depreciation and amortization of these operating districts included in consolidated operating income was approximately million 
at december   the net assets subject to sale totaled million and have been classified as assets held for sale in current assets in the december  consolidated balance sheet 
net interest expense 
net interest expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in net interest expense was due to an increase in capitalized interest  to million in compared to million in the increase in capitalized interest is a result of the acquisition of landfills during primarily financed with the common stock of the company instead of cash 
therefore  the company had a significant increase in assets under development without a corresponding increase in interest bearing debt 
additionally  net interest expense was impacted by an overall reduction in the average interest rate partially offset by a net increase in outstanding debt 
income taxes 
income taxes reflect a effective income tax rate in and in the increase is primarily caused by the income tax accounting effects of asset write downs and applying the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations including the initial recording of deferred income taxes and non deductible transaction costs  partially offset by the absence of income taxes on s corporation pre combination earnings 
this resulted in a one time income tax provision of million 
without considering the effect of pooled companies and asset write downs  the effective tax rate is  which deviates from the federal statutory rate of  due to the effects of differences in the treatment of goodwill for book and tax purposes  state income taxes  and other permanent differences

liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has satisfied its acquisition  capital expenditure and working capital needs primarily through bank financing and public offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities 
between december and december  the company has completed debt financings in excess of billion 
due to the acquisition driven and the capital intensive nature of the company s business strategy  the company has used  and believes that it is reasonably possible that it will continue using amounts in excess of the cash generated from operations to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  including landfill development 
in connection with acquisitions  the company has assumed or incurred indebtedness with relatively short term repayment schedules  thereby increasing its current and medium term liabilities 
additionally  some operating equipment has been acquired using financing leases which have short and medium term maturities 
additionally  the company uses excess cash generated from operations to pay down amounts owed on its revolver which is classified as long term debt 
as a result  the company has periodically had low levels of working capital or working capital deficits 
during the years ended december   and  the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities were as follows in millions year ended december  operating activities net income loss extraordinary loss on early extinguishments of debt non cash acquisition related and unusual costs asset impairments non cash operating expenses loss gain on sale of assets increase in operating assets and liabilities  net cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities cost of acquisitions  net of cash acquired  capital expenditures proceeds from sale of assets other cash used for investing activities  financing activities net proceeds from sale and redemption of preferred stock and common stock net proceeds from long term debt    payments of long term debt   other cash provided by financing activities  increase decrease in cash consists principally of provisions for depreciation and amortization  allowance for doubtful accounts  potentially unrealizable acquisition costs and deferred income taxes 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the company s capital expenditure and working capital requirements have increased significantly  reflecting the company s rapid growth by acquisition and development of revenue producing assets  and will increase further as the company continues to pursue its business strategy 
during  the company acquired solid waste operations representing approximately million in annual revenues million net of intercompany eliminations  and sold operations representing approximately million in annual revenue 
net consideration of approximately billion comprised of cash  notes and common stock  was paid in these transactions 
subsequent to december   the company acquired operating solid waste businesses with annual revenues of approximately million for consideration of approximately million 
for the calendar year  the company expects to spend approximately million for capital expenditures  closure and post closure  and remediation expenditures relating to its landfill operations 
as the company continues to acquire waste operations in  additional capital amounts will be required during for the acquisition of businesses and the capital expenditure requirements related to those acquired businesses 
on december   the company s debt structure consisted primarily of billion of the senior notes and million outstanding under the term loan facility as defined herein 
as of december  there is aggregate availability under the revolving credit facility of approximately million to be used for working capital  letters of credit  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
in october  the company amended the credit agreement to expand to billion from million by increasing the revolving credit facility from million to million and by adding a million delayed draw term facility the delayed draw term facility  after giving effect to the repayment of million of the term loan facility on september  the revolving credit facility includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit increased from million at september  
the indentures relating to the senior notes and the credit agreement contain financial and operating covenants and restrictions on the ability of the company to complete acquisitions  pay dividends  incur indebtedness  make investments and take certain other corporate actions 
a substantial portion of the company s available cash will be required to be applied to service indebtedness 
currently  on an annualized basis  this is expected to include approximately million in annual principal and interest payments 
the company is also required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to its landfill operations and collection contracts 
these financial assurance requirements are satisfied by the company issuing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits to secure the company s obligations as they relate to landfill closure and post closure costs and performance under certain collection contracts 
at december   the company had outstanding approximately million in financial assurance instruments  represented by million of performance bonds  million of insurance policies and million of trust deposits 
during calendar year  the company expects to be required to provide approximately million in financial assurance obligations relating to its landfill operations and collection contracts 
the company expects that financial assurance obligations will increase in the future as it acquires and expands its landfill activities and that a greater percentage of the financial assurance instruments will be comprised of performance bonds and insurance policies 
the company has lease facilities the lease facilities that allow it to enter into equipment leases at rates ranging from similar term treasury note rates plus for terms of to months 
in addition to equipment leases outstanding at december  and of million and million  respectively  the company had available lease commitments of million and million  respectively 
the company has entered into master equipment lease facilities relating to the financing of the acquisition of trucks and containers 
subtitle d and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous waste disposal industry have required the company  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate the company to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase the company s operating costs and impair the company s ability to invest in its facilities 
the company s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements  to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest  or to refinance its indebtedness  and to fund capital amounts required for the acquisition of businesses and the expansion of existing businesses depends on its future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth  management of the company believes that available cash flow  together with available borrowing under the credit agreement  the lease facilities and other sources of liquidity  will be adequate to meet the company s anticipated future requirements for working capital  letters of credit  capital expenditures  scheduled payments of principal and interest on debt incurred under the credit agreement  interest on the senior notes  and capital amounts required for acquisitions and expansion 
however  the principal payment at maturity on the senior notes may require refinancing 
there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness or to make necessary capital expenditures  or that any refinancing would be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all

all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
generally  these statements relate to business plans or strategies  projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies  number of acquisitions and projected or anticipated benefits from acquisitions made by or to be made by the company  or projections involving anticipated revenues  earnings  levels of capital expenditures or other aspects of operating results 
all phases of the company operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are outside the control of the company and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the results of the company s operations and whether forward looking statements made by the company ultimately prove to be accurate 
such important factors important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are disclosed in this section and elsewhere in this report 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the important factors described below that could cause actual results to differ from the company s expectations 
competition 
the solid waste collection and disposal business is highly competitive and requires substantial amounts of capital 
the company competes with numerous waste management companies  a number of which have significantly larger operations and greater resources than the company 
the company also competes with those counties and municipalities that maintain their own waste collection and disposal operations 
forward looking statements assume that the company will be able to effectively compete with the other waste management companies and municipalities 
availability of acquisition targets 
the company s ongoing acquisition program is a key element of its expansion strategy 
in addition  obtaining landfill permits has become increasingly difficult  time consuming and expensive 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in obtaining landfill permits or locating appropriate acquisition candidates that can be acquired at price levels that the company considers appropriate and that reflects historical prices 
the forward looking statements assume that a number of acquisition candidates and landfill properties sufficient to meet the company s goals will be available for purchase and that the company will be able to complete the acquisition at prices that the company has experienced in the past two years 
integration 
the company s financial position and results of operations depend to a large extent on the integration of recently acquired businesses 
the forward looking statements assume that integration of acquired companies  including the internalization of waste  will require from three to nine months from the date the acquisition closes 
failure to achieve effective integration in the anticipated time period or at all could have an adverse effect on the company s future results of operations 
ongoing capital requirements 
to the extent that internally generated cash and cash available under the company s existing credit facilities are not sufficient to provide the cash required for future operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt repayment obligations and or financial assurance obligations  the company will require additional equity and or debt financing in order to provide such cash 
the company has incurred significant debt obligations in the last two years  which entail substantial debt service costs 
the forward looking statements assume that the company will be able to raise the capital necessary to finance such requirements at rates that are as good as or better than those it is currently experiencing 
there can be no assurance  however  that such financing will be available or  if available  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
economic conditions 
the company s business is affected by general economic conditions 
the forward looking statements assume that the company will be able to achieve internal volume and price growth which is not impacted by an economic downturn 
as revenue of the company continues to grow it is likely that the rates of internal growth will reflect growth rates which are less than those experienced in there can be no assurance that an economic downturn will not result in a reduction in the volume of waste being disposed of at the company s operations and or the price that the company can charge for its services 
weather conditions 
protracted periods of inclement weather may adversely affect the company s operations by interfering with collection and landfill operations  delaying the development of landfill capacity and or reducing the volume of waste generated by the company s customers 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of certain of the company s operations 
the forward looking statements do not assume that such weather conditions will occur 
dependence on senior management 
the company is highly dependent upon its senior management team 
in addition  as the company continues to grow  its requirements for operations management with waste industry experience will also increase 
the availability of such experienced management is not known 
the forward looking statements assume that experienced management will be available when needed by the company at compensation levels that are within industry norms 
the loss of the services of any member of senior management or the inability to hire experienced operations management could have a material adverse effect on the company 
influence of government regulation 
the company s operations are subject to and substantially affected by extensive federal  state and local laws  regulations  orders and permits  which govern environmental protection  health and safety  zoning and other matters 
these regulations may impose restrictions on operations that could adversely affect the company s results  such as limitations on the expansion of disposal facilities  limitations on or the banning of disposal of out of state waste or certain categories of waste or mandates regarding the disposal of solid waste 
because of heightened public concern  companies in the waste management business may become subject to judicial and administrative proceedings involving federal  state or local agencies 
these governmental agencies may seek to impose fines or to revoke or deny renewal of operating permits or licenses for violations of environmental laws or regulations or to require remediation of environmental problems at sites or nearby properties  or resulting from transportation or predecessors transportation and collection operations  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
liability may also arise from actions brought by individuals or community groups in connection with the permitting or licensing of operations  any alleged violations of such permits and licenses or other matters 
the forward looking statements assume that there will be no materially negative impact on the company s operations due to government regulation 
potential environmental liability 
the company may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of its operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company 
due to the limited nature of the company s insurance coverage of environmental liability  if the company were to incur liability for environmental damage  its business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the forward looking statements assume that the company will not incur any material environmental liabilities other than those for which a provision has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the notes thereto 
year systems modifications 
the company expects to be year compliant in a timely manner and expects to have no material exposure with respect to information technology related systems 
with respect to non information technology areas  it is uncertain what risks are associated with the year issue and any risks that may be identified could have a material  adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
there can be no assurances that the systems of customers and vendors on which the company relies will be converted in a timely manner and will not have an adverse effect on the company s systems or operations 
the forward looking statements assume that there will be no material adverse effect on the company s systems or operations related to the year issue 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of the company s contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
the company therefore believes it should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require the company to absorb cost increases resulting from inflation 
the company is unable to determine the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
seasonality the company believes that its collection and landfill operations can be adversely affected by protracted periods of inclement weather which could delay the development of landfill capacity or transfer of waste and or reduce the volume of waste generated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term debt 
although no exposure exists with respect to the company s fixed rate long term corporate debt instruments  the company runs the risk of interest rate fluctuations with respect to its libor variable rate senior credit facility at december  to modify the risk from these interest rate fluctuations  the company enters into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to the company s policies and procedures 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the company s long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  average interest rates and estimated fair market value amounts in thousands  except interest rates senior credit average facility interest rate thereafter total  estimated fair value at december   the company has effectively converted its long term debt  which requires payment at variable rates of interest  to fixed rate obligations through interest rate swap transactions 
these transactions require the company to pay fixed rates of interest on notional amounts of principal to counter parties 
the counter parties  in turn  pay to the company variable rates of interest on the same notional amounts of principal 
as a result of these transactions  the company s earnings and cash flows would be impacted should short term market interest rates increase 
increases or decreases in short term market rates would not impact earnings and cash flow as all variable rate debt has been swapped for fixed rates 
in addition  decreases in long term market interest rates would have the effect of increasing the fair value of the company s long term debt and other long term  fixed rate obligations 
the following interest rate table shows the interest rate swaps that were in effect and their fair value as of december  notional fair principal interest underlying interest market value in thousands maturity paid obligations received in thousands  april credit agreement term loan facility libor  october credit agreement term loan facility libor  november credit agreement term loan facility libor  november credit agreement term loan facility libor  march credit agreement term loan facility libor  september credit agreement term loan facility libor market price risk the company has risk exposure associated with the market price on the senior notes 
the senior notes are recorded at book value  which could vary from current market prices 
at december   the senior notes had a value of billion based on quoted average market prices
