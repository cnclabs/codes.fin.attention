item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview results of operations international paper s net sales totaled billion  declining from billion in and in  the impact of acquisitions and sales of businesses largely offset each other 
the decline in sales resulted from lower sales volumes and prices and the weakening new zealand dollar 
sales outside the united states declined to billion in  or of consolidated net sales  from billion  or of consolidated net sales in export sales from the us were at a disadvantage because of the strong us dollar and declined to billion from billion in and total international sales of billion compared with billion in and billion in full year net earnings of million or 
per share included special items that reduced net earnings by million or 
per share 
this compared with a net loss of million or 
per share and net earnings of million or per share 
special items totaling a net loss of million or per share and million or 
per share were recorded in and  respectively 
earnings before special items were million or per share in compared with earnings before special items of million or per share in and million or per share in operating profit totaled billion in both and  down from billion in lower sales volumes and prices for many of our products reduced operating profit by about million as compared with however  this decline was offset by million of manufacturing and other cost reductions and lower material costs as well as higher profits from forestland sales 
in  we curtailed production by million tons at our us pulp and paper mills  more than of which was market related 
in  lower prices cost our us businesses over million in earnings compared with  more than negating the impact of profit improvement programs that added over million to earnings 
excluding special items  return on investment was in compared with in and in despite progress  management recognizes that current financial returns are not satisfactory and continues to focus on company wide business improvement initiatives 
these are described more fully in the section titled special items including restructuring and business improvement actions and in the discussion and analysis of each business segment 
despite the negative effect that unsettled global economic conditions had on the paper and forest products industry  we accomplished a great deal in we have significantly reduced costs  improved our performance with customers  learned how to more efficiently manage capacity in weak markets  sharpened our focus on winning businesses  and completed the sale of about billion of nonstrategic assets 
focusing on improvement in our core businesses  we completed several acquisitions during the year to improve our competitive position and to better serve our customers 
significant among these acquisitions were the zellerbach distribution business  the weston paper industrial packaging business  and oao svetogorsk  a russian pulp and paper manufacturer 
carter holt harvey also expanded its folding carton and cup operations into australia  the latter jointly with our us foodservice business 
our most significant move in was the negotiation of a merger with union camp corporation  a leading us manufacturer of paper  packaging  chemicals and wood products and a significant forestland owner 
the merger  valued at approximately billion including the assumption of debt  is subject to approval by international paper and union camp shareholders 
under the terms of the merger agreement  union camp shareholders will receive international paper common shares worth for each union camp share 
the merger  which will be accounted for as a pooling of interests  should be completed early in the second quarter of cost savings from combining the two companies are expected to be about million annually 
we expect that there will be significant one time costs in associated with the union camp merger 
these include the direct expenses of the merger  which we estimate to be about million  and those charges associated with actions to be taken to achieve the million of annual cost savings 
in  we anticipate that global economic conditions and excess worldwide capacity will continue to present sizable challenges for our industry 
both the us and europe should grow more slowly than in we expect recovery in asian markets  although it is likely to be slow 
nevertheless  we are seeing signs of improvement in supply and demand relationships and are more optimistic about the latter part of and beyond

industry segment results us and european papers us and european papers posted sales of billion compared with billion in and economic turmoil in asia significantly affected the worldwide supply demand balance during  causing weak markets and prices for the company s pulp and paper products 
despite the success of management actions to reduce costs  operating profit fell to million in from million in and million in us papers sales were billion  down from billion in and billion in the decline between and reflects weaker sales volumes for uncoated papers and bristols  offset to some extent by higher prices for coated papers 
demand in the us began to weaken in the second quarter of and continued to wane throughout the year 
the us net trade balance suffered considerably soft export markets  a strong us dollar and rising imports all playing a part 
in view of these weak markets  we curtailed production at our us mills to avoid building inventories 
us papers operating profit in improved considerably from levels but was below uncoated papers sales were billion in  a decline of from and from prices fell steadily during and  on average  were flat with shipments were down by from following profitable results in and  a loss was reported in us coated papers sales of billion increased over and over operating profit improved considerably in after declining in  primarily as the result of start up costs associated with production of accolade  our new lightweight coated free sheet product 
on average  prices increased nearly per ton  about over the first half of was characterized by strong demand for both coated groundwood and our premium coated paper product  accolade 
however  demand weakened significantly by mid year as customers liquidated inventories 
the market was adversely impacted by imports as well  and prices fell steadily as the year progressed 
pulp sales from our us facilities were million in and declined from the business reported a loss in compared with profits in and average paper pulp prices were below volume was lower as well  owing to weak export markets and generally soft paper demand 
sales for specialty pulp were also lower  due to weakness in asia for cigarette filter tow and declining demand for rayon 
european papers sales were billion  about lower than in and european demand for paper grew modestly in  but markets were weak especially in the second half of market related downtime was taken in uncoated and coated papers in the second half of the year 
european paper s shipments of uncoated and coated papers were off to 
prices were lower than in across all product lines  considerably so for coated papers and pulp  and a strong us dollar reduced the value of our sales even further 
despite lower sales  operating profit for our european operations improved more than from as productivity and cost reduction efforts more than offset lower sales 
zanders reported an operating profit for the second consecutive year 
kwidzyn s performance was particularly strong  as the mill achieved record newsprint and boxboard production 
our us and european papers businesses completed a number of actions that will help improve future profits 
we completed a restructuring program that reduced our us papers capacity by  tons 
we undertook a major new program to improve the cost position of our us mills 
the first phase is the reduction of jobs at mills 
a recent upgrade at our natchez  miss  mill should boost specialty pulp sales in and we plan to aggressively market our hammermill brand and expect its increased sales will enrich our sales mix 
in december  we purchased a paper mill in svetogorsk  russia  near finland  that houses one of europe s widest uncoated papers machines  capable of producing  tons annually 
as began  prices were lower than in for most products 
inventories of pulp are relatively low  customer inventories are at normal levels and we believe that prices have bottomed 
however  we see only gradual price recovery this year 
as a result  average prices are expected to be well below the average 
the profit improvement programs now underway are expected to contribute million annually to pre tax earnings of the us and european papers segment  which will partially offset the impact of lower prices 
industrial and consumer packaging industrial and consumer packaging sales totaled billion in  up from billion in operating profit increased to million from million in the improvement in both sales and earnings in was driven mainly by higher average prices for containerboard and corrugated boxes 
sales were billion in and operating profit was million 
industrial packaging revenues were billion in  up from billion in and flat with after posting a loss in  operating profit in was one half that of following a period of strength in  industrial packaging markets weakened during excess capacity  rising imports and a collapse of export markets all played a role 
furthermore  us industry box shipments grew only  considerably less than in over the course of the year  we curtailed our production by  tons to control our inventories 
although containerboard prices declined as progressed  on average they were higher than in during  our industrial packaging businesses made progress on several fronts 
in march  we entered into a joint venture with a manufacturer in turkey  building our presence in eastern europe and asia 
our merger with weston  which owned a corrugated medium mill and box plants  strengthened our capability in those us markets where we did not previously have container plants 
also  it enabled us to increase the amount of company produced containerboard used in our plants to 
several manufacturing initiatives were accomplished in as well 
we completed a capital project at our mansfield  la  mill  which was successful in improving quality and production efficiency 
we increased fiber yield and purchasing efficiency  reducing our per ton costs by to 
and we made organizational changes to foster better customer focus and sales mix 
we expect industrial packaging prices to recover in as downsizing by several north american producers should reduce us industry capacity by 
we shut down our gardiner  ore  mill in late for an indefinite period of time due to the excess capacity in our industrial packaging business 
some price improvement was evident as began 
earnings improvement in will come from cost containment and marketing initiatives 
consumer packaging sales were billion  flat with and up from billion in operating profit was essentially flat with and below results continued to be hurt by the downturn in worldwide markets 
our shipments of bleached board were down nearly  and those into export markets were off 
weak international markets adversely affected both prices and sales mix in domestic markets as well 
at year end  prices for folding carton board were lower than a year earlier 
weak market conditions obscured the positive impact of a number of operating improvements in our mills ran well  raw material and energy costs were down  and per ton manufacturing costs were lower by 
we reorganized our operations to align more closely with customers and the markets they serve beverage packaging  retail packaging and foodservice thereby sharpening customer focus and our ability to offer total packaging solutions 
we made two acquisitions with carter holt harvey enabling us to jointly offer a full line of foodservice products in new markets continental cup in australia and the paper cup division of marinetti sa in chile 
as began  prices for consumer packaging products remained under pressure 
while there are signs that conditions in asia are stabilizing and the slump in export markets is easing  we do not expect significant price recovery this year 
therefore  earnings improvement will depend on internal initiatives 
distribution north american and european distribution sales totaled billion in compared with billion in and billion in operating profit was million in  declining from million in and million in profit on sales declined from in to in due largely to lower margins 
xpedx  our north american distribution operation  posted sales of billion in  up from and the increase over was driven by unit sales growth of and the acquisition of zellerbach in august excluding zellerbach and taussig graphics supply  acquired in late  sales were billion in despite sales growth  operating profit declined mainly because of weaker margins 
the margin decline was caused by lower sales prices and increasingly competitive markets for printing papers as both merchants and customers consolidate 
certain nonrecurring costs also reduced operating profit 
these included marketing costs aimed at strengthening the xpedx brand name  as well as costs related to the zellerbach integration 
operating profit in the second half of improved over the first half  reflecting better operating efficiencies and the impact of zellerbach 
the successful integration of zellerbach was largely completed in we combined the companies  retaining only those customers and markets that met our strategic and financial objectives 
of zellerbach s primary locations  were merged with xpedx facilities in  were closed and remain as stand alone operations in markets not previously served by xpedx 
the last were merged in early as of year end  we had surpassed our goal to eliminate  jobs 
xpedx enters poised to better serve customers with a broader range of products and the best capabilities of both organizations 
furthermore  xpedx continued its ongoing program of consolidating warehousing operations into more efficient regional distribution centers 
xpedx plans to achieve higher sales and earnings in  with the full year impact of zellerbach  further volume growth and ongoing profit improvement initiatives 
in  the adoption of a sophisticated purchasing discipline will yield many advantages  among them lower working capital and better service capability 
our european distribution operations papeteries de france  scaldia in the netherlands and impap in poland posted sales of million  increasing from and operating profit was flat with and overall  we expect higher sales and earnings for the distribution businesses in specialty products specialty products sales in were billion compared with billion in and sales were lower across this group of businesses  especially chemicals and petroleum 
results were affected by the downturn in the asian markets and new competitive capacity 
earnings were million in  declining from million last year and million in restructuring and cost reduction programs had a very positive impact  and the primary reasons for the decline in earnings were lower oil and gas and industrial paper prices 
industrial papers sales were million  down slightly from million in and operating earnings in were down versus and were one half that of us demand for release backing products grew only in  lower than in recent years 
at the same time  new capacity entered the market with overseas demand weakening 
prices were down to 
plans are underway to take substantial costs out of this business 
fine papers sales in were million  lower than and below despite lower sales  operating earnings increased slightly over both and due to restructuring actions taken over the past two years 
we consolidated production on our most efficient machines  reduced fixed costs  and centralized our converting and finishing operations 
there should be additional positive carryover effects of these actions in chemicals sales were million in  down from and from  while operating earnings improved over and over sales volumes declined in due to competitive pricing and product substitution in both the us and europe 
we reduced fixed costs by and improved both product quality and the reliability of our operations 
these actions more than offset the impact of lower sales 
in  we expect additional earnings improvement 
petroleum posted sales of million compared with million in and million in operating profit in declined nearly and was one third that of both sales and profits were severely hurt by oil and gas prices 
oil prices  adjusted for inflation  were at year lows 
in  average oil prices fell by  and gas prices by 
price declines necessitated write downs of our oil and gas properties in see the section titled special items including restructuring and business improvement actions for further details 
if oil and gas prices continue to fall  additional write downs may be required in the company s exploration program  which is focused on west texas  the gulf coast and the gulf of mexico  yielded new reserves in that exceeded production by 
earnings in will depend mainly on oil and gas pricing 
forest products forest products sales were billion in  down from billion in and flat with operating profit of million improved from million in and million in as stronger forestland operations more than offset weakness in our building materials businesses 
forest resources revenues increased to million in from million in sales in were million 
operating profit increased nearly over year earlier levels 
the increase reflects the completion in of a series of sales of partnership interests involving over  acres of forestlands in pennsylvania and new york 
results also benefited from higher average sawtimber prices  which were above  and lower minority interest expense because of the repurchase of ip timberlands  ltd 
s publicly traded class a units in march 
as planned  harvest volumes were slightly lower than in due to the age class limitations of our timber holdings 
as began  sawtimber prices were slightly above early levels 
on average  we expect prices in to be lower than in our harvest volumes will be lower too  again reflecting the age of our forests 
however  we project that our harvest will increase significantly over the next decade as high yield plantations reach maturity 
we will continue to sell nonstrategic forestlands when a tract s sales value represents a premium over its hold and operate value and the tract is not a critical supply factor to our mills 
wood products sales declined nearly to million in and were down from billion in sales were million 
profits for this business weakened significantly 
most of the decline was the result of considerably lower lumber prices  caused by soft export markets  especially in asia  and an increase in canadian imports 
conversely  oriented strand board markets strengthened and prices reached record levels during the year 
plywood pricing was flat with lower sales prices  as well as higher fiber costs  were offset to some extent by better operations  improved yields and a higher margin sales mix 
during the year  several high cost plants in the us industry were forced to close 
by year end the supply demand balance improved and lumber markets began to stabilize 
masonite sales were million in  which was below sales of million 
sales were million 
the decline was caused in part by industry capacity additions and weak asian demand during  which reduced pricing for door facings 
for the same reasons  operating profit fell below levels to about one half of decorative products sales were million in as compared with million in and million in operating profit declined slightly in after falling in in  weak sales of both high and low pressure laminates were largely offset by improvements in other product lines 
during the year  we closed unprofitable medium density fiberboard plants 
in  we expect higher building materials earnings to come mainly from higher volumes and internal cost reduction initiatives 
carter holt harvey international paper s results for this segment differ from those reported by carter holt harvey in new zealand in four major respects carter holt harvey s reporting period is a fiscal year ending march our segment results are for the calendar year 
our segment earnings include only our share of carter holt harvey s operating earnings 
segment sales  however  represent of carter holt harvey s sales 
carter holt harvey reports in new zealand dollars but our segment results are reported in us dollars 
the weighted average currency exchange rate used to translate new zealand dollars to us dollars was 
in  
in and 
in carter holt harvey reports under new zealand accounting standards but our segment results comply with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the major differences relate to cost of timber harvested  copec and start up costs 
these differences reduced segment earnings by about million in and million in each of the years and carter holt harvey s segment sales of billion in were below sales of billion 
the translation effect of the weakening new zealand dollar accounted for of the decline 
also  carter holt harvey sold its building products business in april sales were billion 
results were severely impacted by the weakness in asian economies during this period as well as that of new zealand  which depressed pricing and demand for logs  timber  pulp and paper products 
earnings were also adversely affected by downtime associated with the modernization of the kinleith pulp and paper mill and related start up costs 
segment operating profit declined to million in from million in and million in forests results were negatively impacted by volume and price declines resulting from the near collapse of the korean log markets early in and the slowdown of the japanese economy 
however  log exports  although remaining below  improved sharply in the fourth quarter 
for  under us accounting principles after adjusting for cost of timber harvested  forests operated at a loss 
wood products earnings were only slightly below as operations in australia performed strongly  but were offset by weakness in new zealand 
carter holt harvey s pulp  paper and tissue group reported a decline in earnings caused by substantially lower prices for pulp and paper  as well as a loss of production due to downtime associated with the kinleith project 
however  the tissue business is performing well  with slightly higher earnings from volume increases associated with market share gains and productivity improvements 
packaging earnings were below those of due to significant erosion of both prices and volumes caused by the weak new zealand economy and competitive pressure 
two acquisitions in australia performed well a joint venture cup business with international paper and the folding carton business of riverwood international 
the distribution business reported a loss in both and  but its performance had returned to break even by the fourth quarter of earnings from carter holt harvey s equity investments  primarily copec  were also down significantly principally due to lower pulp sales volumes and prices and the weakening of the chilean peso against the us dollar 
carter holt harvey made significant progress in to reduce costs 
the genesis margin improvement program continues to make a significant contribution to earnings 
the ebit contribution from genesis in was million and the annual run rate for projects now underway is million 
our share  about half  is included in these segment results 
looking forward to  carter holt harvey anticipates improved economic conditions in new zealand and in some asian markets 
as the year began  log and pulp markets have improved from their low levels 
linerboard and pulp prices are showing some signs of recovery 
furthermore  a lower cost structure and the benefits of the kinleith mill modernization are expected to improve results in liquidity capital resources cash provided by operations cash provided by operations totaled billion for compared with billion in and billion in the increase over was primarily due to working capital changes 
after adjusting for noncash special items on an after tax basis  net earnings were about even with and about million below depreciation and amortization expense was billion for compared with billion in and billion in a decrease in working capital added about million to operating cash flow 
working capital reduced operating cash flow by million in and million in investment activities capital spending was billion in  slightly lower than spending of billion and substantially below spending of billion 
capital spending is expected to be just under billion in the following table presents capital spending by each of our business segments 
capital spending by industry segment in millions for the years ended december us and european papers industrial and consumer packaging distribution specialty products forest products carter holt harvey subtotal    corporate and other total    under a business improvement plan  we undertook the sale of billion of nonstrategic assets 
this program was substantially completed in divestitures completed during included the imaging printing and graphic arts businesses  the label business  the veratec nonwovens division and carter holt harvey s building products business 
substantially all of these proceeds were used to reduce debt or for general corporate purposes 
in december  we acquired oao svetogorsk  a pulp and paper business based in russia  which should enhance our ability to serve growing market demand in russia and eastern europe 
we acquired the zellerbach distribution business in august for million in cash and integrated it into xpedx  our distribution operation 
in april  weston paper and manufacturing company  which operates a corrugated medium mill and container plants in the central and southeastern us  was acquired by exchanging about million international paper common shares valued at approximately million  in a noncash transaction 
carter holt harvey also acquired riverwood international  an australia based folding carton business for approximately million in cash early in the second quarter 
in february  we entered into a joint venture with olmuksa in turkey for million for the manufacture of containerboard and corrugated boxes for markets in turkey and surrounding countries 
also  carter holt harvey and international paper jointly acquired australia based continental cup in february for million and the paper cup division of marinetti sa based in chile for million in december these acquisitions will allow carter holt harvey and international paper s foodservice division to offer a full line of foodservice products in the australian and south american markets 
acquisitions in included merbok formtec  an asian door facings company  and taussig graphics supply  inc  a distributor of graphic arts products  which complemented our distribution business 
in march  international paper merged with federal paper board  a paper and forest products company with facilities in the us and the us federal shareholders received  at their election and subject to certain limitations  either in cash or a combination of cash and international paper common stock worth for each federal common share 
in total  federal shares were acquired for approximately billion in cash and billion in international paper common stock  and million of debt was assumed 
other acquisitions included forchem  a tall oil and turpentine processor in finland  and forwood products  a timber processing business in australia  each acquired for about million 
financing activities financing activities during included a billion net reduction primarily of short term debt  and the issuance of billion of preferred securities of subsidiaries 
in march  timberlands capital corp 
ii  a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary  issued million of preferred securities as part of the financing to repurchase the outstanding units of ip timberlands  ltd 
in june  ip finance barbados limited  a wholly owned consolidated non us subsidiary  issued million of preferred securities with a dividend payment that is based on libor 
in september  international paper capital trust iii  a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary  issued million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
proceeds from the latter two preferred securities issuances were used primarily to reduce short term borrowings 
long term debt and notes payable on our consolidated balance sheet were billion compared with billion in and billion in however  after adjusting for foreign exchange  acquisitions and restructuring activities  total debt was reduced by approximately billion and million in and  respectively  on a cash flow basis 
during  one of the corporate debt rating agencies  standard poor  downgraded our long term debt rating from a to bbb 
financing activities during included the issuance of environmental and industrial development bonds for various capital projects  repayment of million of federal debentures  and a net reduction in commercial paper and short term bank borrowings 
financing activities in included short term borrowings of billion to acquire federal  the issuance of million of notes with maturities ranging from to years  and borrowings by ip timberlands  ltd 
of million due in unless otherwise noted  the proceeds of all of the financings described above were used to reduce short term debt or for general corporate purposes 
dividend payments were million in  million in and million in in each year  the dividend was per common share 
capital resources outlook for the company s financial condition continues to be strong 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  supplemented as necessary by short or long term borrowings  will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures  to service existing debt  and to meet working capital and dividend requirements during other financial statement items net interest expense in was million  about even with but below the million reported in  reflecting lower borrowing costs and higher tax related interest income 
minority interest expense declined to million in from million in and million in the main reason for the decrease over the period was the sharp decline in carter holt harvey s results 
also  the acquisition of the publicly traded class a depository units of ip timberlands  ltd 
in march reduced minority interest by million compared with the sale of west coast partnership interests added million to the amount 
also included in the minority interest expense are distributions related to preferred securities of subsidiaries 
increases in these distributions partially offset the other declines 
our equity investments consist primarily of scitex and carter holt harvey s ownership in copec  which it holds through a joint venture 
both scitex and copec are publicly traded companies 
at december   the carrying amounts of these investments and their market values based on the closing per share amounts were as follows in millions scitex copec carrying amount market value for various reasons  the market values based on the closing per share amounts may be either higher or lower than the amount that could be realized if these investments were sold 
special items including restructuring and business improvement actions special items reduced net earnings by million  net earnings by million and net earnings by million 
the following tables and discussion present the impact of special items for  and earnings loss before earnings loss after in millions taxes and minority interest taxes and minority interest before special items oil and gas impairment charges restructuring and other charges gain on sale of business reversals of reserves no longer required after special items during  we recorded million of oil and gas impairment charges million after taxes 
of this amount  million million after taxes was recorded in the fourth quarter and million million after taxes was recorded in the third quarter 
the company has oil and gas exploration and production operations in west texas  the gulf coast and the gulf of mexico 
the securities and exchange commission s regulations for companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities require companies to perform a ceiling test on a quarterly basis 
as a result of low oil and gas prices  the value of our properties were written down through these noncash charges 
also in  we recorded a million pre tax restructuring charge million after taxes and minority interest consisting of million of asset write downs and million of severance costs and we recorded pre tax charges of million million after taxes related to our share of write offs taken by scitex  a investee company  related to in process research and development of an acquisition and its exit from the digital video business 
the scitex items are reflected as equity losses from the investment in scitex in the consolidated statements of earnings 
in addition  we recorded a million pre tax gain million after taxes on the sale of our veratec nonwovens division  and an million pre tax gain million after taxes from the reversal of previously established reserves that were no longer required

in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured by its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement and requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  a company may also implement the statement as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter after issuance 
the statement cannot be applied retroactively and must be applied to a derivative instruments and b certain derivative instruments embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued  acquired or substantively modified after december  and at a company s election  before january  
we have not yet quantified the impact of adopting this statement on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined the timing or method of our adoption

legal and environmental issues international paper operates in an industry subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation 
controlling pollutants discharged into the air  water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment  making continual improvements in environmental performance  and achieving compliance with applicable laws and regulations are continuing goals of international paper 
a total of million was spent in for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste 
we expect to spend approximately million in for similar capital projects  including the costs to comply with the environmental protection agency s epa cluster rule regulations 
amounts to be spent for environmental control projects in future years will depend on new laws and regulations and changes in legal requirements and environmental concerns 
taking these uncertainties into account  our preliminary estimate for and is approximately million in total 
on april   the epa issued final cluster rule regulations that established new requirements regarding air emissions and wastewater discharges from pulp and paper mills to be met over the next to years 
one of the requirements of the cluster rule is that pulp and paper mills use only elemental chlorine free technology ecf in the pulp bleaching process 
we have spent million through to convert of our us and european bleached mills to this technology and for certain other projects related to the cluster rule regulations 
the additional cost related to the cluster rule regulations for the years through is estimated to be million 
projected costs for the following years are in the range of million to million 
the final cost depends on the outcome of cluster rule water regulations for pulp and paper categories other than bleached kraft 
regulations for these categories are not likely to become final until late or we now estimate that annual operating costs  excluding depreciation  will increase approximately million when these regulations are fully implemented 
international paper has been named as a potentially liable party in a number of environmental remediation actions under various federal and state laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
related costs are recorded in the financial statements when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
completion of these actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
three nationwide class action lawsuits filed against international paper have been settled

it also provides for the payment of attorneys fees equaling of the settlement amounts paid to class members  with a nonrefundable advance of million plus million in costs 
the second suit made similar allegations with regard to omniwood siding manufactured by masonite the omniwood lawsuit 
the class consists of all us property owners having omniwood siding installed on or incorporated into buildings from january  to january  the third suit alleged that woodruf roofing manufactured by masonite is defective and causes damage to the structure underneath the roofing the woodruf lawsuit 
the class consists of all us property owners on which masonite woodruf roofing has been incorporated and installed from january  to january  final approval of the settlements of the omniwood and woodruf lawsuits was granted by the court on january  the settlements provide for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims made basis  and provides for payment of attorneys fees equaling of the settlement amounts paid to class members  with a nonrefundable advance of million plus  in costs for each of the two cases 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a million provision to increase our legal reserves 
while the total cost of these three settlements is not presently known with certainty  we believe that our legal reserves  totaling million at december   are adequate to cover any amounts to be paid 
the reserve balance is net of million of expected insurance recoveries 
through december   settlement payments of million  including the million of non returnable advances of attorneys fees discussed above have been made 
also  we have received million from our insurance carriers 
the settlements are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
international paper and masonite have the right to terminate each of the settlements after years from the dates of final approval 
while any proceeding or litigation has an element of uncertainty  the company believes that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim that is pending or threatened  or all of them combined  will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations
