overview corsair communications  inc is a leading provider of software and system solutions for the wireless industry 
corsair s phoneprint r system has proven highly effective in reducing cloning fraud 
the phoneprint system has prevented hundreds of millions of fraudulent call attempts  some of corsair s customers have reported up to a reduction in cloning fraud losses after deploying phoneprint 
the company s prepay tm billing system provides wireless telecommunications carriers with a prepaid system designed to fully integrate with the upcoming wireless intelligent network standards 
the company believes that its products can provide a number of benefits to wireless telecommunications carriers  including reduced costs  improved cash flow  increased market penetration and improved customer service 
the worldwide demand for wireless telecommunications services has grown significantly in recent years as those services have become widely available and increasingly affordable 
the yankee group estimates that the number of wireless telecommunications subscribers worldwide increased from approximately million in to approximately million in  and the number of subscribers is expected to approximate million by the end of the company s revenue is comprised of three categories hardware  software and service revenue 
revenue from hardware sales is recognized upon shipment  unless a sales agreement contemplates that corsair provide testing  integration or implementation services  in which case hardware revenue is recognized upon commissioning and acceptance of the product the activation of the cell site equipment following testing integration and implementation 
revenue from the licensing of software products generally is recognized upon delivery of the products  unless the sales includes post contract customer support for which vendor specific objective evidence does not exist  in which case the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license period 
revenue from services is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance support  on a percentage of completion basis over the term of the consulting effort  or during the month the training or operations support is provided 
cost of hardware revenue consists of manufacturing overhead for the company s test and assembly operation  materials purchased from the company s subcontractors and vendors  hardware purchased from third party vendors  depreciation of rental units  and shipping costs 
cost of software license revenue primarily includes fees paid to third party software vendors  as well as costs associated with the installation and configuration of the software 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of expenses for personnel engaged in network support  customer support  installation  training and consulting as well as communications charges and network equipment depreciation 
the company s gross margin has grown significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future  depending on the mix of hardware  software and services 
the company s software licenses have a higher gross margin than its service and hardware revenue 
in addition  the hardware gross margin can vary from customer to customer depending on the contract and from model to model depending upon the customer s cell site and switch configuration 
therefore  the company s operating results will be affected by the mix of hardware units  software licenses  and service fees recognized during each period 
the company sells phoneprint primarily through its direct sales force  but has also entered into distribution agreements with motorola  ericsson  aurora and telesis  and seeks to enter into additional distribution agreements for international markets 
the company has entered into a sales referral agreement with lucent and sumitomo 
the company sells prepay primarily through a distribution arrangement with ericsson and to a limited extent through its direct sales force 
the company s gross margin will also vary depending on the mix of direct sales and sales through distribution channels and sales referral arrangements 
the company continues to make efforts to generate profits by increasing sales volume  decreasing costs of goods sold  and through certain other measures 
while the company has certain programs in place intended to reduce operating costs  the company s expenses could increase in the foreseeable future 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the company will reach or sustain profitability 
see risks and uncertainties lack of sustained profitability

year issue the year issue refers to the inability of certain date sensitive computer chips  software and systems to recognize a two digit date field as belonging to the st century 
mistaking for or any other incorrect year could result in a system failure or miscalculations  causing disruptions to corsair s products or operations including manufacturing  or a temporary inability to process transactions or send invoices  or engage in other normal business activities 
the year issue may create unforeseen risks to corsair from product or internal computer system failures  as well as from the failure of third party computer systems with which it deals 
failures of corsair s products or computer systems and or third party computer systems could have a material adverse impact on corsair s ability to conduct its business 
management has initiated an enterprise wide program to prepare corsair s computer systems and applications for the year with respect to the portion of products developed internally by corsair  systems and applications developed by third parties and incorporated in corsair s products  and systems relied upon to conduct operations including payroll  accounting and cash management 
with respect to software developed internally by the company  the results of that evaluation to date initially revealed certain source codes that were unable to appropriately interpret the upcoming calendar year the company has completed its work to upgrade these programs to make them capable of processing data incorporating year dates without material errors or interruptions 
with respect to third party software incorporated in the company s products  all vendors whose software is used by the company have indicated that their software is or will be year compliant 
this includes all systems relied upon to conduct operations 
currently  the company is establishing contingency plans to address the impact to the company in the event its suppliers  products and internal systems are not year compliant 
evaluation of year issues is continuing  and there can be no assurance that additional issues  not presently known by the company  will not be discovered which could present a material risk to the function of the company s products and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the total cost of the testing and conversion of internally developed hardware and software is expected to be approximately  and should be substantially incurred by june  a significant portion of these costs has not been incremental costs to corsair  rather redeployment of existing information technology resources 
corsair expects to continue to incur internal staff costs as well as consulting and other expenses related to infrastructure and facilities enhancements necessary to prepare the systems for the year item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash and short term investment in corporate debt securities with high quality credit ratings and maturities of less than one year
