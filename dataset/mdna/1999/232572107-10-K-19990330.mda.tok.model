item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in cymer s statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated revenues product sales other 
total revenues cost and expenses cost of product sales research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses operating income other income expense net 
income before income tax provision benefit and minority interest income tax provision benefit minority interest 
net income gross margin on product sales years ended december  and revenues 
cymer s total revenues consist of product sales  which include sales of laser systems and spare parts and service and training  and other revenues  which primarily include revenue from funded development activities performed for customers and for sematech 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time of shipment  unless customer agreements contain inspection or other conditions  in which case revenue is recognized at the time such conditions are satisfied 
funded development contracts are accounted for on the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs  after giving effect to estimates for costs to complete the development project 
product sales decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to lower sales of duv photolithography laser systems 
a total of laser systems were sold in compared to laser systems in the decrease was primarily attributable to the overall market decline in the semiconductor industry during cymer s installed base of lasers continued to rise in supporting cymer s belief that revenues from spares  replacement parts and services will become an increasingly larger component of product sales 
funded development revenues declined from million for to  for  primarily due to completion of larger laser research projects sponsored by sematech 
cymer expects that funded development revenues will continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenues as cymer focuses on product sales 
cymer s sales are generated primarily by shipments to customers in japan  the netherlands  and the united states 
approximately   and of the company s sales in   and  respectively  were derived from customers outside the united states 
cymer maintains a wholly owned japanese subsidiary which sells to cymer s japanese customers 
revenues from japanese customers  generated primarily by this subsidiary  accounted for   and of revenues in   and  respectively 
the activities of cymer s japanese subsidiary are limited to sales and service of products purchased by the subsidiary from the parent corporation 
all costs of development and production of cymer s products  including costs of shipment to japan  are recorded on the books of the parent company 
cymer anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its net sales 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales includes direct material and labor  warranty expenses  license fees  manufacturing and service overhead  and foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts associated with purchases of cymer s products by the japanese subsidiary for resale under firm third party sales commitments 
cost of product sales rose from million in to million in primarily due to additional inventory obsolescence reserves recognized during the fourth quarter of offset by lower sales volume in the gross margin on these sales decreased from in to in primarily due to a million obsolete inventory reserve associated with the accelerated customer acceptance of the series lasers over the series lasers  and an increase in foreign field support overhead costs as cymer continued to build its worldwide field support infrastructure in japan  singapore  europe  korea and southeast asia in order to provide fast and responsive service to the semiconductor manufacturers 
net gains or losses from foreign currency exchange contracts are included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income as the related sales are recognized 
cymer recognized net gains on such contracts of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs of internally funded and externally funded projects as well as continuing research support expenses which primarily include employee and material costs  depreciation of equipment and other engineering related costs 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased product support efforts associated with the release of cymer s series lasers  the ongoing development of the series laser  and the continued development of new laser products 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses rose from to in the respective periods due to the decline in cymer s revenues as well as the increase in development expenditures throughout cymer expects that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in as cymer continues to invest in the development of new products and product enhancements 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include the expenses of the sales  marketing and customer support staffs and other marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased product management and sales support efforts and marketing infrastructure activities developed over the period 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses rose from to in the respective periods due to a decrease in overall revenues from period to period as well as an increased focus on building a worldwide sales and marketing team in and beyond 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management and administrative personnel costs  professional services and administrative operating costs 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  due to ongoing process quality development costs and an increase in general and administrative support as cymer s overall level of business activity increased 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses increased from to in the respective periods 
other income expense net 
net other income expense consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses associated with the fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen against the united states dollar 
net other income expense decreased from  of net other income for to million of net other expense for  primarily due to the increase in interest income associated with the investment of excess cash and a foreign exchange gain in versus a net loss in  offset by a full year of interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated notes in foreign currency exchange loss totaled  interest income totaled million  and interest expense totaled million for  compared to a foreign exchange gain of  interest income of million and interest expense of million for cymer s results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen against the united states dollar 
sales by cymer to its japanese subsidiary are denominated in dollars  and sales by the subsidiary to customers in japan are denominated in yen 
cymer s japanese subsidiary manages its exposure to such fluctuations by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its purchase commitments to cymer 
the gains or losses from these contracts are recorded as a component of cost of product sales  while the remaining foreign currency exposure is recorded as other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are accumulated as a separate component of consolidated stockholders equity 
provision for income taxes 
the tax provision of million in was primarily attributable to the substantial growth in cymer s pretax income partially offset by the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance carried over from the tax benefit of million reported in was primarily attributed to tax credits and permanent differences between taxable income and book income which resulted in a negative effective tax rate for the year 
years ended december  and revenues 
product sales increased from million in to million in  primarily due to increased sales of duv photolithography laser systems 
a total of laser systems were sold in compared to laser systems in funded development revenues remained constant at million for and  primarily due to the laser research project sponsored by sematech 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales rose from million in to million in due to the increase in sales volume 
the gross margin on these sales decreased from in to in primarily due to the increase in additional specific warranty reserves of million  an increase in field support overhead costs as cymer continued to build its worldwide field support infrastructure in order to provide fast and responsive service to the semiconductor manufacturers  and one time charges associated with bringing cymer s new manufacturing facility more fully on line 
warranty reserve expenses are included in cost of product sales as the related sales are reported 
for  an additional specific warranty reserve was expensed to certain lasers previously shipped 
this additional warranty expense was to incorporate changes in these lasers to ensure that they meet the current product configuration and specifications 
cymer took a proactive approach to make the necessary hardware and software changes to the laser systems as a preventative maintenance measure to meet performance levels warranted by cymer 
these scheduled changes were completed in early the gross margin on product sales prior to this specific reserve was for the period ended december  cymer recognized net gains on foreign currency exchange contracts of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased product support efforts associated with the release of cymer s series lasers  the hiring of additional technical personnel and the continued development of new laser products 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses declined from to in the respective periods due to the growth in cymer s revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  due primarily to increased product management and sales support efforts and marketing activities as more lasers were placed in the field over the period 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expense declined from to in the respective periods due to the growth in cymer s revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  due to an increase in general and administrative support as cymer s sales volume  manufacturing capacity  employee recruiting requirements and overall level of business activity increased 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses decreased from to in the respective periods 
other income expense net 
net other income expense increased from  of net other expense for to  of net other income for  primarily due to the increase in interest income associated with the investment of excess cash  offset by interest expense associated with the convertible subordinated notes issued in and a foreign currency exchange loss for foreign currency exchange gains totaled  interest income totaled  and interest expense totaled  for  compared to a foreign exchange loss of  interest income of million and interest expense of million for provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision in was primarily attributable to the growth in cymer s pre tax income offset by net operating loss carryforwards from prior years 
the tax provision of million in was primarily attributable to the substantial growth in cymer s pretax income partially offset by the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance carried over from liquidity and capital resources since inception  cymer has funded its operations primarily through the private sale of equity securities totaling approximately million  borrowings from certain of its investors for bridge financing  bank borrowings  its september  initial public offering  which resulted in net proceeds to cymer of approximately million  the public offering on december   which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  and raising a net million in a convertible subordinated note offering on august  as of december   cymer had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments  million in working capital and million in bank debt 
net cash used for operating activities was approximately million  and million for and  respectively  whereas net cash was provided by operating activities of million for the increases in cash used in operations for the periods ended december  and were primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable and inventory as the working capital requirements of cymer continued to increase due to the expansion of the business during these periods 
the net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to increases in depreciation associated with the prior year expansion efforts  offset by decreases in accounts receivable 
net cash used for investing activities was approximately million  million and million in  and the increase in cash used for investing activities during the periods ended december   and primarily reflects the investment activity of funds received through cymer s public offerings in  and through the convertible subordinated notes offering in as well as the purchase of computer equipment  test equipment  research and development tools  manufacturing process machinery and tenant improvements to the field support organizations and manufacturing facility in order to accommodate business expansion throughout the periods 
cymer s financing activities provided net cash of approximately million  and million for and  respectively 
in  cymer received net proceeds of approximately million from its two public offerings  received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and decreased bank borrowings by million 
during the same period  cymer reduced discounting of commercial drafts in japan by approximately million 
in  cymer issued million in convertible subordinated notes with net costs of million and  in addition  received million in net proceeds for the issuance of common stock and reduced bank debt by million 
in  cymer s financing activities used net cash of approximately million primarily due to the million repurchase of treasury stock offset by million in bank loans for the period 
cymer has available credit arrangements with a bank permitting borrowings of up to million 
these borrowings are unsecured and provide for a million optional currency revolving line of credit 
cymer has two foreign currency exchange facilities 
cymer had forward foreign exchange contracts at december  to buy million for billion yen 
the total unrecorded deferred loss and discount on these contracts as of december  was approximately  and  respectively 
on january   cymer announced a program to repurchase up to million of cymer s common stock 
as of december  cymer had purchased million shares at a total cost of million 
cymer requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
cymer s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of cymer s manufacturing expansion  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing and field service and support  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the market acceptance of cymer s products 
cymer believes that it has sufficient working capital and available bank credit to sustain operations and provide for the future expansion of its business during recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
the new standard will become effective for cymer for the year ending december  interim reporting for this standard will be required 
cymer has not yet assessed the effect of this standard on cymer s current reporting and disclosures 
impact of year issue the year issue yk is primarily the result of computer systems using a two digit format rather than four digits to indicate the year 
such computer systems will be unable to differentiate between the year and the year  causing errors and system failures which may disrupt the operations of such systems 
cymer has been addressing this issue and has been focusing its efforts through a five step approach identification of the systems which may be vulnerable to yk problems  assessment of the impact on the systems identified  remediation of non compliant systems and components and determination of solutions for non compliant suppliers  testing of systems and components following remediation  and documentation 
cymer is complete with the identification of systems which may be vulnerable to the yk issue  and is approximately complete with the assessment of the impact on these systems 
the assessment includes factory systems  desktop pc s  fax machines  printers  and common software packages in use at cymer 
in addition  all suppliers have been contacted for their yk plans and all new software licenses include yk statements 
remediation is complete 
the testing of systems and components is approximately complete and is expected to be complete by the end of march  cymer s ongoing plan is to continue the process of working with suppliers and customers to verify their yk readiness by june   as well as to obtain their then current yk related public statements on yk compliance 
cymer plans to evaluate any issues raised in this process in terms of any special actions cymer should consider taking to reduce related risks  including further follow up with suppliers and customers as the year approaches 
these and other issues will be included in cymer s yk ongoing action plan 
cymer s yk contingency plan consists of the following offsite backup of all critical data and software  multiple redundant suppliers for all critical data communication and telecommunications services  readiness planning for support personnel  outside consultants identified for rapid availability  and ongoing evaluation and planning for contingencies 
cymer s current laser systems are not yk compliant per sematech standards 
the laser systems currently require manual intervention to reset the internal clock to account for leap year in the year cymer s customers have been informed of the non compliance and have been provided with instructions for the manual correction of the date between january and february  not resetting the internal clock would have no material impact on the operation of the laser system 
cymer has demonstrated and tested the software fix to bring the lasers to full sematech yk compliance 
these tests have been completed  however  no date has been determined for full deployment of the software upgrade out to the field 
cymer currently has no reason to believe the software upgrade will not be implemented prior to the year based on the assessment efforts to date  cymer does not believe that the yk issue will have a material adverse effect on cymer s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the cost of the yk process is estimated at approximately  of which approximately  has been incurred 
however  cymer s beliefs and expectations are based on certain assumptions that ultimately may prove to be inaccurate 
aside from global infrastructure yk requirements  cymer s worst case scenario may include supplier and customer purchase  delivery and payment delays  server and desktop computer failures  one or more critical software systems failures  including embedded control systems  and failure of one or more internal and external communications systems such as telephones  networks  voice mail and paging systems 
additional potential sources of risk include a the inability of key suppliers and customers to be yk compliant  b the disruption of global transportation channels as a result of general system failures  and c an overall failure of necessary infrastructure such as electricity and telecommunications 
if any of these were to occur  there could be a material adverse effect on cymer s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors likely fluctuations in operating results certain factors causing fluctuations cymer s operating results have in the past fluctuated and are likely in the future to fluctuate significantly 
these fluctuations depend on a variety of factors which may include the demand for semiconductors in general and  in particular  for leading edge devices with smaller circuit geometries  the rate at which semiconductor manufacturers take delivery of photolithography tools from cymer s customers  cyclicality in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  the timing and size of orders from cymer s small base of customers  the ability of cymer to manufacture  test and deliver laser systems in a timely and cost effective manner  the mix of laser models  replacement parts and service revenues  the ability of cymer s competitors to obtain orders from cymer s customers  the entry of new competitors into the market for duv photolithography illumination sources  the ability of cymer to manage its costs as it supplies its products in higher volumes  and cymer s ability to effectively manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  principally with respect to the japanese yen in which sales by cymer s japanese subsidiary are denominated 
in addition  as customers become more efficient at integrating cymer s lasers into their photolithography tools  reductions in customer laser inventories may affect cymer s operating results 
timing of revenue recognition cymer has historically derived a substantial portion of its quarterly and annual revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
as a result  the precise timing of the recognition of revenue from an order for a small number of systems can have a significant impact on cymer s total revenues and operating results for a particular period 
if customers cancel or reschedule orders for a small number of systems or if cymer cannot fill orders in time to recognize revenue during a particular period  this could adversely affect cymer s operating results for that period 
for example  unanticipated manufacturing  testing  shipping or product acceptance delays could cause such cancellations  rescheduling or inability to fill orders promptly 
fixed expenses cymer s expense levels are based  in large part  on cymer s expectations as to future revenues 
therefore  cymer s expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
if revenue levels fall below expectations  this would disproportionately and adversely affect net income 
cymer cannot forecast the impact of these and other factors on its revenues and operating results in any future period with any degree of certainty 
semiconductor manufacturer demand cymer believes that semiconductor manufacturers are currently developing capability for production and pilot production of um  um and below devices 
cymer also believes that the efforts to develop such capability are driving present demand for its excimer lasers for duv photolithography tools 
once semiconductor manufacturers have acquired such capability  their demand for cymer s duv photolithography tools will depend on whether they want to expand their capacity to manufacture such devices 
this will in turn depend on whether their sales forecasts and manufacturing process yields justify such an investment 
cymer currently expects that demand for its duv excimer lasers will depend on such demand and process development constraints of the semiconductor manufacturers 
industry conditions recently  cymer has increased some aspects of its operations in response to anticipated improvement in industry conditions 
should these improvements not materialize  the planned increases in spending may delay the return to profitable operations 
due to the foregoing  as well as other unanticipated factors  cymer s operating results will likely fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters 
such failure to meet operating result expectations would materially adversely affect the price of cymer s common stock 
dependence on single product line cymer s only product line is excimer lasers 
the primary market for excimer lasers is for use in duv photolithography equipment for manufacturing deep submicron semiconductor devices 
demand for cymer s products will depend in part on the rate at which semiconductor manufacturers adopt excimer lasers as the illumination source for their photolithography tools 
impediments to such adoption include a shortage of engineers with experience implementing  utilizing and maintaining duv photolithography systems that incorporate excimer laser illumination sources  instability of photoresists used in advanced duv photolithography and potential shortages of specialized materials used in duv optics 
there can be no assurance that such impediments can or will be overcome 
in any event  such impediments may materially reduce the demand for cymer s products 
further  if cymer s customers experience reduced demand for duv photolithography tools  or if cymer s competitors are successful in obtaining significant orders from such customers  cymer s financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
dependence on semiconductor industry cymer derives substantially all of its revenues from photolithography tool manufacturers 
photolithography tool manufacturers depend in turn on the demand for their products from semiconductor manufacturers 
semiconductor manufacturers depend on the demand from manufacturers of end products or systems that use semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic and significant downturns 
these downturns have often had a severe effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  including photolithography tools 
cymer believes that downturns in the semiconductor manufacturing industry will periodically occur  resulting in periodic decreases in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
in addition  cymer believes that in a future downturn cymer s need to continue investment in research and development  and to maintain extensive ongoing customer service and support capability will constrain its ability to reduce expenses 
accordingly  downturns in the semiconductor industry could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on small number of customers a small number of manufacturers of duv photolithography tools constitute cymer s primary customer base 
four large firms  asm lithography  canon  nikon and svg lithography a subsidiary of silicon valley group  inc  dominate the photolithography tool business 
collectively  they accounted for approximately   and of the cymer s total revenues in   and  respectively 
individually  sales to asm lithography  canon  nikon and svg lithography accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of total revenues for  and   and  respectively  of total revenues in cymer expects that sales of its systems to these customers will continue to account for substantially all of its revenues in the foreseeable future 
none of cymer s customers are obligated to purchase a minimum number of cymer s products 
the loss of any significant business from any one of these customers or a significant reduction in orders from any one of these customers  would have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reductions caused by changes in a customer s competitive position  a decision to purchase illumination sources from other suppliers  or economic conditions in the semiconductor and photolithography tool industries  could all cause such a loss of business or reduction in orders 
need to manage a changing business cymer has recently dramatically expanded and contracted the scope of its operations and the number of employees in most of its functional areas 
for example  cymer increased the number of its employees from at december  to at december  to at december  and then decreased that number to at december  cymer installed new management information systems and has also substantially expanded its facilities and manufacturing capacity 
for example  since december  cymer has occupied three additional buildings covering approximately  square feet 
in a cyclical environment of dramatic growth or contraction  cymer will need to continue close management of these areas  and to improve its management  operational and financial systems  including accounting and other internal management systems  quality control  delivery and field service and customer support capabilities 
cymer must also effectively manage its inventory levels  including assessing and managing excess and obsolete inventories associated with the changing environment and new product introductions 
cymer will need to attract  train  retain and manage key technical personnel in order to support cymer s growth and or contraction 
cymer will also need to manage effectively its international operations  including the operations of its subsidiaries in japan  korea  taiwan  singapore and the netherlands  its field service and support presence in asia and europe and its relationship with seiko as a manufacturer of its photolithography lasers 
cymer must also effect timely deliveries of its products and maintain the product quality and reliability required by its customers 
any failure to effectively manage cymer s growth or contraction would materially adversely affect cymer s financial condition and results of operations 
competition lambda physik  komatsu and ushio cymer currently has three significant competitors in the market for excimer laser systems for photolithography applications lambda physik  komatsu  ltd 
komatsu and ushio 
all of these companies are larger than cymer  have access to greater financial  technical and other resources than does cymer  and are located in closer proximity to cymer s customers than is cymer 
cymer believes that lambda physik and komatsu are aggressively seeking to gain larger positions in this market 
cymer believes that its customers have each purchased one or more products offered by these competitors and that its customers will continue to actively qualify these competitors lasers in their search for a second source 
cymer believes that komatsu in particular has been qualified for production use by chipmakers in japan 
cymer could lose market share and its growth could slow or even decline as competitors gain market acceptances 
other technologies in the future  cymer will likely experience competition from other technologies  such as euv and scalpel processes 
to remain competitive  cymer believes that it will need to manufacture and deliver products to customers on a timely basis and without significant defects  and maintain a high level of investment in research and development and in sales and marketing 
cymer might not have sufficient resources to continue to make the investments necessary to maintain its competitive position 
small and immature market for excimer lasers in addition  the market for excimer lasers is still small and immature 
larger competitors with substantially greater financial resources  including other manufacturers of industrial lasers  might attempt to enter the market 
cymer might not remain competitive 
a failure to remain competitive would have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of excessive inventory buildups by photolithography tool manufacturers pholithography tool manufacturers constitute substantially all of cymer s customers 
photolithography tool manufacturers sell their systems in turn to semiconductor manufacturers 
current market conditions in the industry could cause cymer s customers to reduce their orders for new laser systems as they try to manage their inventories to appropriate levels which better reflect their expected sales forecasts 
cymer is working with its customers to better understand end user demand for duv photolithography tools 
however  there can be no assurance that cymer will be successful in this regard  or that its customers will not build excessive laser inventories 
excessive customer laser inventories could result in a material decline in cymer s revenues and operating results in future periods as such inventories are brought into balance 
dependence on key suppliers cymer obtains certain of the components and subassemblies included in its products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
in particular  there are no alternative sources for certain of such components and subassemblies  including certain optical components used in cymer s lasers 
in addition  cymer is increasingly outsourcing the manufacture of various subassemblies 
to date cymer has been able to obtain adequate supplies of the components and subassemblies in a timely manner from existing sources 
however  due to the nature of cymer s product development requirements  key suppliers often need to rapidly advance their own technologies in order to support cymer s new product introduction schedule 
these suppliers may or may not be able to satisfy cymer s schedule requirements in providing new modules and subassemblies to cymer 
if cymer cannot obtain sufficient quantities of such materials  components or subassemblies  or if such items do not meet cymer s quality standards  delays or reductions in product shipments could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
limited production use of excimer lasers the semiconductor industry is at the early stages of adopting the excimer laser technology into photolithography applications 
cymer s products might not meet production specifications or cost of operation requirements over time when subjected to prolonged and intense use in volume production in semiconductor manufacturing processes 
if any semiconductor manufacturer cannot successfully achieve or sustain volume production using cymer s lasers  cymer s reputation with semiconductor manufacturers or the limited number of photolithography tool manufacturers could be damaged 
this would have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
need to expand field service and support organization cymer believes that the need to provide fast and responsive service to the semiconductor manufacturers using its lasers is critical 
cymer cannot depend solely on its direct customers to provide this specialized service 
therefore  cymer believes it is essential to establish  through trained third party sources or through its own personnel  a rapid response capability to service its lasers throughout the world 
accordingly  cymer is currently expanding its direct support infrastructure in the united states  japan  europe  korea  singapore  taiwan and southeast asia 
this expansion entails recruiting and training qualified field service personnel and building effective and highly trained organizations that can provide service to customers in various countries in their assigned regions 
cymer has historically experienced difficulties in effectively training field service personnel 
cymer might not be able to attract and train qualified personnel to establish these operations successfully 
further  the costs of such operations might be excessive 
a failure to implement this plan effectively could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
rapid technological change  new product introductions semiconductor manufacturing equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change 
cymer believes that its future success will depend in part upon its ability to continue to enhance its excimer laser products and their process capabilities  and develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities 
in order to enhance and improve its products and develop new products  among other things  cymer must work closely with its customers  particularly in the product development stage  to integrate its lasers with its customers photolithography tools 
future technologies  such as euv and scalpel processes  might render cymer s excimer laser products obsolete 
further  cymer might not be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to its existing products and processes in a timely manner that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
the failure to do so could materially adversely affect cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel cymer is highly dependent on the services of a number of key employees in various areas  including engineering  research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing 
in particular  there are a limited number of experts in excimer laser technology 
there is intense competition for such personnel  as well as for the highly skilled hardware and software engineers cymer requires 
cymer has in the past experienced  and continues to experience  difficulty in hiring personnel  including experts in excimer laser technology 
cymer believes that  to a large extent  its future success will depend upon the continued services of its engineering  research and development  sales and marketing and manufacturing and service personnel  and its ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled personnel in each of these areas 
cymer does not have employment agreements with most of its employees  and cymer might not be able to retain its key employees 
the failure of cymer to hire  train and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary technology cymer patents cymer believes that the success of its business depends more on such factors as the technical expertise of its employees  as well as their innovative skills and marketing and customer relations ability  than on patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  the success of cymer may depend in part on patents 
as of december   cymer owned united states patents covering certain aspects of technology associated with excimer lasers 
such patents will expire at various times during the period from january to december as of december   cymer had also applied for additional patents in the united states  of which have been allowed 
as of december   cymer owned foreign patents and had filed patent applications in various foreign countries 
cymer s pending patent applications and any future applications might not be approved 
cymer s patents might not provide cymer with competitive advantages 
third parties might challenge cymer s patents 
and third parties patents might have an adverse effect on cymer s ability to do business 
in this regard  due to cost constraints  cymer did not begin filing for patents in japan or other countries with respect to inventions covered by its united states patents and patent applications until therefore  cymer has lost the right to seek patent protection in those countries for certain of its inventions 
additionally  because foreign patents may afford less protection under foreign law than is available under united states patent law  any such patents issued to cymer might not adequately protect cymer s proprietary information 
furthermore  third parties might independently develop similar products  duplicate cymer s products or  if patents are issued to cymer  design around the patents issued to cymer 
competitive patents others may have filed and in the future may file patent applications that are similar or identical to those of cymer 
to determine the priority of inventions  cymer may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office 
such interference proceedings could result in substantial cost to cymer 
such third party patent applications might have priority over patent applications filed by cymer 
other forms of protection cymer also relies upon trade secret protection  employee nondisclosure agreements  third party nondisclosure agreements  and other intellectual property protection methods to protect its confidential and proprietary information 
despite these efforts  third parties might independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  otherwise gain access to cymer s trade secrets  or disclose such technology 
cymer might not be able to meaningfully protect its trade secrets 
possible claims to ownership of cymer s intellectual property cymer has in the past funded a significant portion of its research and development expenses from outside research and development revenues 
cymer has received such revenues from photolithography tool manufacturers and from sematech  a semiconductor industry consortium  in connection with the design and development of specific products 
cymer currently funds a small portion of its development expenses through sematech 
although cymer s arrangements with photolithography tool manufacturers and sematech seek to clarify the ownership of the intellectual property arising from research and development services performed by cymer  disputes over the ownership or rights to use or market such intellectual property might arise between cymer and such parties 
any such dispute could result in restrictions on cymer s ability to market its products and could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
patent infringement third parties have in the past notified  and may in the future notify  cymer that it may be infringing their intellectual property rights 
komatsu  one of cymer s competitors  has notified cymer s japanese manufacturing partner  seiko instruments  inc seiko  that certain aspects of cymer s lasers might infringe three patents that have been issued to komatsu in japan 
komatsu has notified seiko that komatsu intends to enforce its rights under the komatsu patents against seiko if seiko engages in manufacturing activities for cymer 
in connection with its manufacturing agreement with seiko  cymer has agreed to indemnify seiko against such claims under certain circumstances 
attorneys representing komatsu are currently challenging one of cymer s us patents in the us patent office 
in addition  cymer has engaged in discussions with komatsu with respect to the komatsu patents  in the course of which komatsu has also identified to cymer a number of pending applications and additional patents 
cymer  in consultation with japanese patent counsel  has initiated oppositions to the komatsu patents and the applications in the japanese patent office 
however  litigation might ensue with respect to these claims 
cymer and seiko might not ultimately prevail in any such litigation 
komatsu might assert infringement claims under additional patents 
any patent litigation would at a minimum be costly 
litigation could also divert the efforts and attention of cymer s management and technical personnel 
both could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  in the future third parties might assert other infringement claims  and customers and end users of cymer s products might assert other claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims 
such assertions  if proven to be true  might materially adversely affect cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any such claims are asserted against cymer  cymer may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
however  such a license might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
cymer could decide  in the alternative  to resort to litigation to challenge such claims or to design around the patented technology 
such actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of cymer s management and technical personnel  which would materially adversely affect cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
trademark cymer has registered the trademark cymer in the united states and certain other countries and is seeking additional registrations in certain countries 
in japan  cymer s application for registration was rejected on the grounds that it is similar to a trademark previously registered by a japanese company for a broad range of products 
cymer is seeking a partial nullification of that registration with respect to laser devices and related components and does not believe that the holder of that trademark is engaged in any business similar to that of cymer 
for this reason  cymer is continuing to use the trademark cymer in japan  believes that it will ultimately be permitted to register such mark for use with its products  and believes it is not infringing that company s trademark 
cymer might not ultimately succeed in its efforts to register its trademark in japan 
cymer might be subjected to an action for trademark infringement  which could be costly to defend 
if successful  such an action would require cymer to cease use of the mark and  potentially  to pay damages 
risks associated with manufacturing in japan cymer has qualified seiko of japan as a contract manufacturer of its photolithography lasers 
komatsu  a competitor of cymer  has advised seiko that certain aspects of cymer s lasers might infringe certain patents that have been issued to komatsu in japan 
komatsu has advised seiko it intends to enforce its rights under such patents against seiko if seiko engages in manufacturing activities for cymer 
in the event that  notwithstanding its manufacturing agreement with cymer  seiko should determine not to continue manufacturing cymer s products until resolution of the matter with komatsu  cymer s ability to meet any heavy demand for its products could be materially adversely affected 
see uncertainty regarding patents and protection of proprietary technology 
risks of international sales and operations significant international trade cymer derived approximately  and of its revenues in  and  respectively  from customers located outside the united states 
because a significant majority of cymer s principal customers are located in other countries  particularly asia  cymer anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues 
in order to support its overseas customers  cymer maintains subsidiaries in japan  korea  taiwan  singapore and the netherlands  is expanding its field service and support operations worldwide  and will continue to work with seiko as a manufacturer of its products in japan 
cymer might not be able to manage these operations effectively 
cymer s investment in these activities might not enable it to compete successfully in international markets or to meet the service and support needs of its customers 
additionally  a significant portion of cymer s sales and operations could be subject to certain risks  including tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations  currency exchange risks and exchange controls  potentially adverse tax consequences  and the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable collection 
because many of cymer s principal customers  as well as many of the end users of cymer s laser systems  are located in asia  the recent economic problems and currency fluctuations affecting that region could intensify cymer s international risk 
further  while cymer has experienced no difficulty to date in complying with united states export controls  these rules could change in the future and make it more difficult or impossible for cymer to export its products to various countries 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
currency fluctuations sales by cymer to its japanese subsidiary are denominated in dollars  while sales by the subsidiary to customers in japan are denominated in yen 
this means that cymer s results of operations show some fluctuation based on the value of the japanese yen against the us dollar 
cymer s japanese subsidiary manages its exposure to such fluctuations by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its purchase commitments 
management will continue to monitor cymer s exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  use financial hedging techniques to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations might have a material adverse effect on cymer s results of operations or financial condition 
in the future  cymer might need to sell its products in other currencies  which would make the management of currency fluctuations more difficult and expose cymer to greater risks in this regard 
foreign regulations numerous foreign government standards and regulations apply to cymer s products 
these standards and regulations are continually being amended 
although cymer endeavors to meet foreign technical and regulatory standards  cymer s products might not continue to comply with foreign government standards and regulations  or changes thereto 
it might not be cost effective for cymer to redesign its products to comply with such standards and regulations 
the inability of cymer to design or redesign products to comply with foreign standards could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental and other government regulations federal  state and local regulations impose various controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of substances used in cymer s manufacturing process and on the facility leased by cymer 
cymer believes that its activities conform to present governmental regulations applicable to its operations and its current facilities 
these regulations include those related to environmental  land use  public utility utilization and fire code matters 
such governmental regulations might in the future impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon cymer 
they might also restrict cymer s ability to expand its operations 
the adoption of such measures  or failure by cymer to comply with applicable environmental and land use regulations or to restrict the discharge of hazardous substances  could subject cymer to future liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be curtailed or suspended 
risks of product liability claims cymer faces a significant risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products results in personal injury or death 
cymer might experience material product liability losses in the future 
cymer maintains insurance against product liability claims 
however  such coverage might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to cymer 
such coverage also might not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred 
further  in the event that any of cymer s products prove to be defective  cymer may need to recall or redesign such products 
a successful claim brought against cymer in excess of available insurance coverage  or any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity against cymer  could have a material adverse effect on cymer s business  financial condition and results of operations 
possible price volatility of common stock the following factors may significantly affect the market price of cymer s common stock actual or anticipated fluctuations in cymer s operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new contracts by cymer or its competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  conditions and trends in the laser device and other technology industries  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general market conditions  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
the market price of cymer s common stock has fluctuated substantially in recent periods  rising from at cymer s initial public offering on september   to on august   and then declining to on october   these prices reflect cymer s for stock split effective as of august  
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
such litigation can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
legal matters cymer has been named as a defendant in several putative shareholder class action lawsuits which were filed in september and october  in the us district court for the southern district of california 
certain executive officers and directors of cymer are also named as defendants 
the plaintiffs purport to represent a class of all persons who purchased cymer s common stock between april  and september  the class period 
the complaints allege claims under the federal securities laws 
the plaintiffs allege that cymer and the other defendants made various material misrepresentations and omissions during the class period 
the complaints do not specify the amount of damages sought 
the complaints have been consolidated into a single action 
no lead plaintiff has yet been appointed and a consolidated amended complaint has not yet been filed 
discovery has not yet commenced 
cymer believes that it has good defenses to the claims alleged in the lawsuits and will defend itself vigorously against these actions 
the defense of these actions may cause some disruption in cymer s operations and may from time to time distract management from day to day operations 
the ultimate outcome of these actions cannot be presently determined 
accordingly  no provision for any liability or loss that may result from adjudication or settlement thereof has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
anti takeover effect of nevada law and charter and bylaw provisions  availability of preferred stock for issuance nevada law and cymer s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage a proxy contest or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of cymer s common stock 
in addition  the board of directors is authorized to issue  without shareholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock 
such shares of preferred stock may have voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that may be superior to those of the common stock and that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
the board of directors could use the issuance of preferred stock or of rights to purchase preferred stock to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk cymer conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations 
due to the large volume of business cymer manages in japan  the japanese operation poses the greatest foreign currency risk 
cymer uses financial instruments  principally forward exchange contracts  in japan to manage its foreign currency exposures 
cymer does not enter into forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
cymer enters into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations related to purchases of cymer s inventories by cymer japan for resale under firm third party sales commitments 
net gains or losses are recorded on the date the inventories are received by cymer japan the transaction date and are included in cost of product sales in the consolidated statements of income as the related sale is consummated 
amounts due from to the bank on contracts not settled as of the transaction date are recorded as foreign exchange contracts receivable payable in the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   cymer had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to buy us million for billion yen under foreign currency exchange facilities with contract rates ranging from yen to yen per us and various expiration dates through september  see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the total unrecorded deferred loss and discount on these contracts at december  was us  and  respectively 
investment and debt risk cymer maintains an investment portfolio consisting primarily of government and corporate fixed income securities  certificates of deposit and commercial paper see note to consolidated financial statements 
while it is cymer s general intent to hold such securities until maturity  management will occasionally sell particular securities for cash flow purposes 
therefore  cymer s investments are classified as available for sale and are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
due to the conservative nature of the investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
in august  cymer issued million aggregate principal amount of step up convertible subordinated notes due august  with interest payable semi annually february and august  commencing february  interest on the notes is stated at per annum from august  through august  and at per annum from august  to maturity or earlier redemption  representing a yield to maturity accrued at approximately 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of common stock of cymer at any time on or after november  and prior to redemption or maturity  at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
cymer cannot redeem the notes prior to august  thereafter  cymer can redeem the notes from time to time  in whole or in part  at specified redemption prices 
the notes are unsecured and subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness of cymer 
the indenture governing the notes does not restrict the incurrence of senior indebtedness or other indebtedness by cymer 
these notes are recorded at face value on the balance sheets 
the fair value of such debt  based on quoted market prices at december  was million 
as of december  and  million in convertible subordinated notes was outstanding
