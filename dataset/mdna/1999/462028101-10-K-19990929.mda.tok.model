item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results of operations could differ significantly from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors discussed under item business and elsewhere in this report 
overview the company develops  manufactures and commercializes controllable drug delivery systems using iontophoretic technology 
the majority of the company s revenues have been generated through the sale of its phoresor system and related iontophoretic drug delivery products in the physical therapy market for use in the delivery of dexamethasone and contract research revenues from the company s collaboration with novartis 
the company recently introduced its local dermal anesthesia products into the market place and  to date  has not realized significant revenue from the sales of such products 
since its inception  the company has generally incurred operating losses and it expects to incur additional operating losses over the next several years as a result of anticipated costs associated with a significant increase in internally funded research  development and clinical trial activities relating to new applications for its iontophoretic drug delivery technologies  and the consolidation and equipping of its facilities 
as of june   the company s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
the company s ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend on its ability to achieve market acceptance and successfully expand sales of its existing products  successfully complete the development of  receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully manufacture and market its products under development  as well as successfully negotiate and enter into agreements with collaborative partners  licensors  licensees and other parties for the development  clinical testing  manufacture  marketing or commercialization of certain of its products or products in development  as to which there can be no assurance 
fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase can be attributed primarily to higher sales of the company s iontophoretic drug delivery products for the treatment of local inflammation resulting from continued overall growth in this market 
contract research revenues  royalties and license fees were  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this is attributable to a decrease in research revenues pursuant to the company s collaborative development agreement with novartis  which ended in december accordingly  this decrease in research revenue is expected to continue while the company seeks new collaborative development partnerships 
the effect of the loss of contract research revenue on the company s future operating results may be offset  in part  by a reduction in research and development expenditures incurred in connection with the collaboration 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting increased material and labor costs associated with higher unit sales volumes and certain non recurring engineering and tooling costs 
costs of products sold decreased as a percentage of product sales primarily as a result of lower fixed manufacturing services costs spread over a larger sales volume offset  in part  by an increase in labor and material costs 
research and development expense 
research and development expenditures were approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal a reduction in research and development expenditures on novartis related activities during the current period was offset by increased discretionary spending on internally funded research projects  including the phase iii clinical trials for iontodex for the treatment of acute local inflammatory conditions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and expenses in fiscal included increased legal  professional and related costs incurred in connection with investor relations and sec compliance  increased patent prosecution and maintenance costs  and executive recruiting costs associated with the company s efforts to fill positions in its executive management staff 
in addition  the company incurred one time costs associated with the restructuring of the company s field sales force and an increase in certain marketing and promotional expenses 
expenses in fiscal included recruiting  personnel and other sales and marketing costs associated with the company s ongoing investment in the market introduction of numby stuff 
in addition  the company realized increased costs associated with the maintenance and prosecution of the patent portfolio acquired from elan 
although the response to the company s numby stuff product line by medical professionals and medical organizations has been positive  the process by which such products obtain administrative review and final approval for use in the hospital environment is extremely complex and time consuming 
among other things  such new products are subject to extensive evaluations within each hospital and often each department  require review and approval by hospital products and therapeutics committees  and must be accepted for inclusion on the hospital s formulary 
as a result  in august  the company restructured its sales and marketing organization to reduce overall costs and bring them in line with current product sales and the slower than anticipated rate of market penetration of numby stuff 
in addition  the company is seeking to expand its sales  marketing and distribution capabilities for all of its product lines through collaborative partnerships and by broadening its current dealer distribution network 
other costs and expenses 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease can be attributed to lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of the company s indebtedness to elan in transactions related to the initial public offering of its common shares in april in contrast  in fiscal  the company recognized non cash interest expense on the million in notes issued to elan in connection with the elan agreements 
interest income and other miscellaneous income was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  reflecting higher interest earnings on higher average invested cash balances  which included the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering in april income loss from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations of  in fiscal compares to a loss from continuing operations of million in fiscal the income in fiscal can be attributed to the interest earnings on invested cash balances  while the loss in fiscal can be attributed to the non cash interest charges on the elan indebtedness and the company s investment in the sales and marketing of numby stuff  which  to date  has not generated significant revenues 
fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
product sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase can be attributed to higher sales of the company s iontophoretic drug delivery products for the treatment of local inflammatory conditions resulting from overall market growth in this segment 
contract research revenues  royalties and license fees were million in both fiscal and contract revenues during fiscal  included the company s receipt of royalty revenues pursuant to the sale of its motion control division and during fiscal included a milestone payment from novartis 
contract research revenues received during fiscal and pursuant to the novartis agreement covered a substantial portion of the company s research and development expenses 
costs of products sold 
costs of products sold increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting increased material and labor costs associated with higher unit sales volumes 
costs of products sold increased as a percentage of product sales primarily as a result of higher royalty obligations and a less favorable product mix 
research and development expense 
research and development expenditures were approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal includes a higher proportion of expenditures on internally financed product development projects of the company 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase can be attributed primarily to recruiting  personnel and other sales and marketing costs associated with the company s continued investment in the market introduction of numby stuff 
in addition  the company realized increased costs associated with the maintenance and prosecution of the patent portfolio acquired from elan 
non recurring charges 
in fiscal  the company entered into the elan agreements pursuant to which the company acquired certain rights to elan s in process research and development relating to iontophoretic drug delivery  including issued and pending united states and foreign patents  know how and clinical data 
as a result of this transaction  the company recorded a non recurring charge of approximately million 
other costs and expenses 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase can be attributed to the recognition of interest expense on million in notes issued to elan in connection with the elan agreements 
interest income and other miscellaneous income was  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  reflecting higher interest earnings on higher average invested cash balances  which included the net proceeds from the company s initial public offering in april the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards 
income taxes in fiscal reflect the estimated alternative minimum tax liability  offset by the recognition of future tax benefits resulting from the allocation of income tax expense  at statutory rates  to the pre tax income of the company s discontinued operations 
income loss from continuing operations 
a loss from continuing operations of million in fiscal compares to a loss from continuing operations of million in fiscal the loss in fiscal can be attributed to the non cash interest charges on the elan indebtedness and the company s investment in the sales and marketing of numby stuff  which  to date  has not generated significant revenues 
the loss in fiscal can be attributed to the non recurring charge resulting from the write off of in process research and development acquired from elan 
liquidity and capital resources prior to fiscal  the company funded its operating losses primarily through private equity financing  convertible debt arrangements  capital lease financing  and collateralized bank loans 
beginning in fiscal  the company s operating and research activities have been internally funded  primarily as a result of the research and development revenues and license fees the company received from novartis 
novartis elected not to renew its collaborative research and development agreement with the company  which expired on december  accordingly  the company s contract research revenues declined during fiscal and may continue to decline in future years 
the effect of the loss of contract research revenue on the company s future operating results and cash flow may be offset  in part  by a reduction in research and development expenditures incurred in connection with the collaboration 
in addition  the company may earn additional contract research revenues  if successful in its efforts to enter into new collaborative research and development arrangements 
in april  the company consummated an initial registered public offering pursuant to which the company issued  common shares and raised approximately  net of underwriters discounts and estimated expenses 
as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in a manner which is intended to maximize liquidity and return while minimizing investment risk  and  whenever possible  the company seeks to minimize the potential effects of concentration of credit risk 
the company generated  in cash from operating activities during fiscal compared to a use of  in fiscal increased cash from operating activities in fiscal can be attributed to higher net income with a higher depreciation component as well as a decrease in the company s net investment in working capital during the current period 
the company consumed  in cash for operating activities during fiscal compared to providing million in cash during fiscal this increased cash consumption can be attributed to the higher cash loss in fiscal in combination with the company s continued net investment in working capital used to finance its sales growth and expanded product offerings 
historically  the company s operations have not been capital intensive and  therefore  its investment in property  plant and equipment during the periods presented has not been significant 
the company anticipates however  that its investment in facilities and equipment will increase in the future  due to the company s desire to consolidate its manufacturing  administrative and research and development facilities and the need to increase the automation of its electrode manufacturing processes to meet higher expected sales volumes 
the company s expenditures for equipment and furniture were   and  in each of the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
other sources and uses of cash during the periods included the following 
during fiscal  the company used  for payments on long term capital lease obligations 
during fiscal  the company purchased a license to certain iontophoretic drug delivery technology at a cost of  including transaction expenses  received proceeds of  under a long term capital lease  and paid  for the mandatory redemption of a portion of its series c preferred shares 
during fiscal  the company generated  in cash from the private placement of its common shares  paid  to complete the mandatory redemption of its series b preferred shares  and used  for payments on long term obligations in other non cash transactions related to the initial public offering  i the company granted warrants to purchase  common shares to the underwriters  exercisable after april   at an initial exercise price of per share  ii elan converted the amounts outstanding under the elan notes  including accrued interest thereon  into  common shares and  shares of newly created series d preferred shares  at the initial public offering price of per share  iii the  series c preferred shares of the company which were outstanding immediately prior to the offering were automatically converted  on a share for share basis  into common shares  and iv the company issued an additional  common shares to laboratoires fournier  pursuant to the anti dilution provisions of a prior stock purchase agreement between the companies 
also during fiscal  novartis converted their minority interest in dermion  inc into common shares of the company 
the company expects to continue to incur substantial costs associated with the expansion of its research and development activities  including clinical trials  continued investment in sales and marketing of new product lines  additional investment in working capital  and the cost of consolidating and equipping its facilities 
the company anticipates that the net proceeds of the company s initial public offering  together with existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the operations of the company at least through fiscal however  the company may be required or elect to raise additional capital before that time 
the company s actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  some of which are outside the company s control 
discontinued operations prior to january  the company provided state of the art prosthetics products to amputees throughout the united states  canada and western europe through its motion control division 
motion control s principal products were the utah artificial arm and the procontrol ii  advanced myoelectric prostheses for above and below the elbow amputees 
in december  the company sold the assets of the motion control division for million and granted the purchaser an exclusive  worldwide license and sublicense to the patents  trademarks  know how and other intellectual property of the company relating to the motion control products 
under the terms of that sublicense agreement  the company will receive license fees and royalties on future sales of the motion control products 
there was no significant gain or loss recognized on the sale 
the results of operations of the motion control division  exclusive of any corporate allocations  are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impact of the year many computer systems experience problems handling dates beyond the year the company has completed its evaluation of its primary operating systems including its financial systems  material requirements planning  and production lot tracking systems and believes  based upon its evaluation as well as representations from its software suppliers  that its operating systems are substantially year compliant 
to the extent that any software applications are not fully year compliant  the company expects that software upgrades made in the normal course of business will either minimize  isolate or possibly eliminate any substantive risks associated with software or system failure 
to date  the company has not incurred any significant costs associated with the evaluation or modification of its systems relating to year compliance and does not anticipate the need to incur any costs outside the normal course of business 
in the event that any of the company s systems should fail due to a failure to identify and address a year exposure  the company believes that the size and scope of its operations would allow the company to revert to manual operating systems on a timely basis 
the custom circuitry and software utilized in the company s iontophoretic dose controllers do not include any date driven functions and therefore will not exhibit any change in performance due to the arrival of the year the company has initiated procedures designed to evaluate the year exposure of its significant suppliers and other vendors whose systems may impact the company s operations 
to date  the company has not identified any compliance deficiencies that might have a significant impact on the company if not rectified by such supplier or vendor on a timely basis 
there can be no assurance that such a deficiency will not be discovered or arise in the future or that the company would be able to identify and validate an alternative source for any service or material which may be affected by such deficiency 
additional risk factors future results could differ materially from those currently anticipated by the company due to a number of factors  including those identified in this section and elsewhere in this form k  any of which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
continuing operating losses  uncertainty of future profitability 
since  the company has sustained losses in each fiscal year  except fiscal years and the company had an accumulated deficit of million as of june  the company intends to expand its product lines  research and development  business development and marketing efforts in the near future and  therefore  does not anticipate being profitable in the near term 
the company s ability to achieve and sustain profitability will depend on its ability to achieve market acceptance  and successfully expand sales of its existing products  as well as successfully complete the development of  receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully manufacture and market  its products under development  as to which there can be no assurance 
uncertainty of market acceptance and limited market penetration 
the company has generated only limited revenues  primarily from sales to physical therapists of its drug delivery system for delivery of dexamethasone for the treatment of acute local inflammation 
the company began marketing a local dermal anesthetic product that uses iontocaine  in january  and has generated only limited revenues from that product to date 
for the company to be successful  its products will need to achieve broad market acceptance by the medical profession 
the company s products use a method of active transdermal drug delivery which  to date  has not gained significant market penetration  and no assurance can be given that the company s current or future products will ever achieve broad market acceptance 
uncertainties related to product development 
two of the primary components of the company s business strategy are to develop and commercialize iontophoretic drug delivery systems for new and existing drugs and to develop additional applications for its existing products 
the company will be required to undertake time consuming and costly development activities and seek regulatory approval for these new products and applications 
product revenues may not be realized from the sale of any such products for several years  if at all 
the company can give no assurance that its product development efforts  either alone or in collaboration with other parties  will ever be successfully completed  that it can obtain required regulatory approvals of its products  that products under development can be manufactured at acceptable cost or with appropriate quality  or that its products can meet market needs or achieve market acceptance 
reliance on collaborative partners 
the company s strategy is to enter into arrangements with corporate partners  licensors  licensees and other parties for the development  clinical testing  manufacture  marketing or commercialization of certain of its products or products in development 
since  novartis has funded a substantial portion of the total research and development costs of the company pursuant to the r d agreements 
although the company met all of the essential development objectives under the r d agreements  in july  novartis advised the company that it would not renew the r d agreements beyond the scheduled december   expiration date 
since december   and until the company enters into additional collaborative agreements  the company will be required to internally fund all of its research and development expenditures 
the failure to enter into such arrangements on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company s product development efforts  business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company anticipates it will enter into additional collaborative arrangements with other parties in the future  there can be no assurance the company will be able to negotiate any such additional collaborative arrangements on terms which are acceptable to the company  if at all 
to the extent the company chooses not  or is not able  to establish such collaborations  it could experience significantly increased business risk and capital requirements in the development  clinical testing  manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of its products 
the company could also encounter significant delays in introducing products into markets or find that the development  manufacture or sale of proposed products in such markets is adversely affected by the absence of those collaborative arrangements 
intense competition and rapid technological change 
the drug delivery  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive and rapidly evolving  with significant developments expected to continue at a rapid pace 
the company s success will depend on its ability to maintain a competitive position and develop new products and technologies for efficient and cost effective drug delivery 
the company s products will compete with other formulations of drugs and with other drug delivery systems  including other iontophoretic delivery systems 
there can be no assurance any of the company s products will have advantages that will be significant enough to cause medical professionals to prefer or even use them 
new drugs or further development of alternative drug delivery methods may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific drug or indication  or may offer comparable performance at lower cost  than that offered by the company s iontophoretic drug delivery systems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many competitors  including public and private corporations  academic institutions  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations  are involved in the development of drug delivery systems  including competing electrotransport related drug delivery technologies 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources  are more experienced  and are larger  more established organizations than the company 
there can be no assurance the company s competitors will not succeed in more rapidly developing or marketing products that are more effective or commercially attractive than the company s current or future products  or that would render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive 
there can also be no assurance the company will have the financial resources  technical or management expertise  or manufacturing or support capability to compete in the future 
the company has licensed certain rights to its iontophoretic drug delivery technologies to other parties  including alza  laboratoires fournier and novartis  that are or may become direct competitors of the company 
these companies could compete with the company for contracts with the company s collaborative partners and could also develop iontophoretic drug delivery systems that will compete directly with many of those currently marketed or being developed by the company 
reliance on third party distribution 
the company presently markets its drug delivery systems for the treatment of acute local inflammation primarily to physical therapists through a nationwide network of distributors and independent sales representatives 
the company is currently marketing its local dermal anesthesia products in the united states hospital market through a limited number of sales personnel who work directly for the company and independent manufacturers representatives 
in order to achieve broad distribution and market penetration of its current and future products  the company intends to enter into arrangements with collaborative marketing partners or distributors that have national or market specific marketing capabilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing  or establish new  marketing arrangements on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
dependence on patents and proprietary technology 
the company s ability to commercialize many of the products it has under development will depend  in part  on its or its licensors ability  both in the united states and in other countries  to obtain patents  enforce those patents  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
the patent positions of drug delivery  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
there can be no assurance the patents currently owned and licensed by the company  or any future patents  will prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products  or that other companies will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of company products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties by the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance any of the company s products or methods will be patentable  will not infringe upon the patents of third parties  or that the company s patents or future patents will give the company an exclusive position in the subject matter claimed by those patents 
the company may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain licenses  defend infringement actions or challenge the validity of those patents in court 
there can be no assurance a license will be available to the company  if at all  on terms and conditions acceptable to the company  or that the company will prevail in any patent litigation 
there can be no assurance the company s pending patent applications will result in issued patents  patent protection will be secured for any particular technology  any patents that have been or may be issued to the company or its licensors will be valid or enforceable or that the company s patents will provide meaningful protection to the company 
the company also relies on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information in its product development activities 
to the extent the company relies on confidential information to maintain its competitive position  there can be no assurance other parties may not independently develop the same or similar information 
in august  the united states patent and trademark office pto issued a patent to alza covering the iontophoretic delivery of fentanyl 
a similar patent application in europe has thus far been rejected  although the company believes alza has appealed that rejection 
the united states patent was the subject of a reexamination by the pto and all of the substantive claims within the patent were also rejected  however alza has successfully appealed that rejection to the united states board of patent appeals and interferences 
there can be no assurance alza will not be successful in an appeal in europe 
therefore  if the company develops a drug delivery system for fentanyl  the company would be required to obtain a license from alza to market any iontophoretic drug delivery system it develops for fentanyl in the united states and possibly europe 
there can be no assurance such a license would be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
presently  the company has discontinued any product development programs using fentanyl 
need to manage expanding operations 
if the company is successful in achieving market acceptance of its products  it will be required to expand its operations  particularly in the areas of research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing 
as the company expands its operations in these areas  those expansions will likely result in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and place significant strain on the company s management  operating and financial systems and other resources 
to accommodate any such growth and compete effectively  the company will be required to implement improved information systems  procedures and controls  and to expand  train  motivate and manage its work force 
the company s future success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of its current and future management personnel to operate effectively both independently and as a group 
there can be no assurance the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support the company s future operations 
future capital needs  uncertainty of additional funding 
the further development and commercialization of the company s products and technology will require a commitment of substantial funds to conduct research and development activities  including preclinical and clinical studies  to expand distribution and hire additional sales and marketing personnel and to expand and develop manufacturing capabilities 
the company believes that existing cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the operations of the company for at least the next months  however  the company s actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  and the company may be required or elect to raise additional capital before that time 
to satisfy its capital requirements  the company may seek to raise funds through public or private financings  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to shareholders and debt financing may involve significant restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements to raise additional funds may require the company to relinquish its rights to certain of its technologies  products or marketing territories 
there can be no assurance that any such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company  if at all 
uncertainty of government regulation 
the research  development  manufacture and marketing of the company s products are extensively regulated by the fda  which requires its approval of drugs and medical devices before they can be marketed in the united states 
similar approvals are also required from other regulatory bodies in foreign countries 
the regulatory processes established by these government agencies are lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
in addition  once approval is obtained  that approval may be withdrawn 
the company has received approval from the fda on its nda for iontocaine  and the fda has allowed the company to market its iontophoretic dose controllers and electrode products for use with ions of soluble salts or other drugs under the fda s k regulations governing medical devices 
however  in  the fda publicly stated that it intends to require manufacturers of iontophoretic devices to obtain pmas for marketed devices currently used with drugs not specifically labeled for iontophoretic delivery  which would include the company s dose controller for use with ions of soluble salts or other drugs  such as dexamethasone 
the agency to date has not published such a regulation 
if the fda calls for pmas for preamendment class iii iontophoretic devices  the company would be required to have a pma accepted for filing by the fda within days after the date of the final regulation calling for pmas 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to complete and file a pma within the prescribed time period  or that the fda would approve it 
the company s failure to submit a pma within the required timeframe could result in the company being required to cease commercial distribution of the phoresor for use with any drug other than iontocaine 
any interference with the company s ability to distribute its phoresor system for use with dexamethasone would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
even if the company obtains regulatory approval  a marketed product  its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities and pertinent operations are subject to extensive regulation and periodic inspections 
discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility could result in fda sanctions  restrictions on a product or manufacturer  or an order to withdraw and or recall a specific product from the market 
there can also be no assurance that changes in the legal or regulatory framework or other subsequent developments will not result in the limitation  suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals granted to the company 
such events  were they to occur  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company and certain of its suppliers are also required to comply with us and foreign regulations governing manufacturing practices  which mandate procedures for extensive control and documentation of product design  control and validation of the manufacturing process and overall product quality 
if the company or its suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations regarding these manufacturing practices  the company could be subject to sanctions 
under the fda s regulations  when a manufacturer changes or modifies a device for which it has received a k clearance  it is required to obtain an additional k clearance for the modified device if the modification significantly affects the safety or efficacy of the device  or if the modification results in a major change in intended use 
in such cases  the manufacturer is expected to make the initial determination as to whether the modification is of a kind that would require a new k clearance 
the fda s regulations provide only limited guidance in making this determination 
the fda has cleared the company s iontophoretic dose controller and electrode kits for marketing under a k clearance 
since obtaining its k clearances  the company has made modifications to its products 
based on the checklist developed by the fda to assist manufacturers in determining whether they are required to obtain a k clearance for a modified device  the company has determined that a new k submission was not required in connection with the commercial introduction of such products 
however  there can be no assurance that the fda will not require the company to obtain additional k clearances with respect to those products 
if the fda requires the company to submit a new k notice for any device modification  the company may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until the k notice is cleared by the fda 
dependence on single sources of supply 
a key material used in many of the company s current electrode products is available only from a single supplier 
in addition  the company obtains iontocaine from abbott laboratories under a contract which may be terminated with six months notice 
the company also has the right to obtain dexamethasone from luitpold pharmaceuticals  inc american regent laboratories  inc 
under a contract expiring in january the company believes that  if necessary  alternative sources can be developed or alternate materials can be substituted for each of these single sourced materials 
although the company has not experienced difficulty acquiring these materials on commercially reasonable terms and in sufficient quantities to maintain required production levels  no assurance can be given that price increases or interruptions in the supply of these materials will not occur in the future or that the company will not have to seek alternate suppliers or obtain substitute materials  which may require additional product validations and regulatory submissions 
any significant price increase  interruption of supply  inability to secure an alternate source or qualify a substitute material could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to manufacture its products or to obtain or maintain regulatory approval of its products 
the company s current dose controllers are manufactured under a contract with a third party electronics manufacturer 
there can be no assurance that its present supplier can manufacture sufficient quantities of dose controllers that meet quality and performance standards on a timely basis 
if the supplier cannot meet the company s requirements  or in the event of an interruption of its supply  the company would be required to identify  qualify and validate an alternate source of supply within a reasonable period of time 
limited manufacturing experience 
the company manufactures its iontophoretic drug delivery electrodes in quantities sufficient to satisfy its current level of product sales 
to meet anticipated increases in sales  the company may need to increase its production significantly beyond its present manufacturing capacity 
accordingly  the company may be required to increase its manufacturing capacities or to contract with another party to manufacture its products 
there can be no assurance the company can successfully increase its capacity on a profitable basis  or contract with another party on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
significant increases in production volume will likely require changes in the company s product and manufacturing process in order to facilitate increased automation of the company s production 
there can be no assurance such changes in products or processes or efforts to automate the company s manufacturing process will be successful 
the company believes its facilities operate in accordance with the quality system regulations currently prescribed by the fda and in substantial compliance with iso and ce mark standards 
the company has gmp audits conducted by a qualified  independent organization on a regular basis and is iso and ce mark certified 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to maintain such compliance  particularly if the scale of the company s manufacturing operations increases 
uncertainty of health care reimbursement 
the company s ability to commercialize its products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of those products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations in the united states and in foreign markets where the company s products will be sold and used 
third party payors can affect the pricing or relative attractiveness of the company s products by regulating the reimbursement they provide on the company s or competing products or therapies 
there can be no assurance such reimbursement will continue at present levels  if at all 
some insurance carriers do not reimburse health care providers for use of the company s products in certain applications 
furthermore  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of new health care products 
effective october   the health care financing administration adopted new regulations providing for the treatment of capital related costs for medical products 
the company is unable to predict what adverse impact on the company  if any  these or any additional government regulations  legislation or initiatives or changes by other payors affecting reimbursement or other matters that may influence decisions to obtain medical devices may have 
retention and attraction of key employees 
the company is highly dependent on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific  managerial  manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the company s area of activity  and there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the company does not carry key man insurance with respect to any of its executives or employees 
risk of product liability  product recalls and warranty claims  availability of insurance 
the testing  marketing and sale of drug delivery and related pharmaceutical products for use in humans involves unavoidable risks 
the use of the company s products in clinical trials and the sale of its products upon approval may expose the company to potential product liability resulting from the use of such products 
in addition  the existence of a product liability claim  a product recall or excessive warranty claims in any such case  whether arising from defects in design or manufacture or otherwise could have an adverse effect on the company s sales of that product or require a change in the indications for which it may be used 
product liability insurance in the company s industry is expensive and difficult to obtain 
although the company currently has product liability insurance  there can be no assurance the existing coverage is adequate 
the company will seek to maintain and appropriately increase its insurance coverage as its product sales increase and the clinical development of its new product applications progress 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to maintain its current levels of insurance on acceptable terms  will be able to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of its products proceeds or that any particular level of insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
anti takeover provisions of certain of the company s agreements
