although matrix believes these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  it cannot give any assurance that it will reach every objective 
matrix is making these forward looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of as required by the act  matrix identifies the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results projected  forecasted  estimated  or budgeted 
changes in general economic conditions in the united states 

changes in laws and regulations to which matrix is subject  including tax  environmental  and employment laws and regulations 

the cost and effects of legal and administrative claims and proceedings against matrix or its subsidiaries 

conditions of the capital markets matrix utilizes to access capital to finance operations 

the ability to raise capital in a cost effective way 

year readiness of matrix  its customers  and its vendors

the ability to control costs 

changes in foreign economies  currencies  laws  and regulations  especially in canada and venezuela where matrix has made direct investments 

political developments in foreign countries  especially in canada and venezuela where matrix has made direct investments 

the ability of matrix to develop expanded markets and product or service offerings as well as its ability to maintain existing markets 

technological developments  high levels of competition  lack of customer diversification  and general uncertainties of governmental regulation in the energy industry 

the ability to recruit  train  and retain project supervisors with substantial experience 

a downturn in the petroleum storage operations or hydrocarbon processing operations of the petroleum and refining industries 

changes in the labor market conditions that could restrict the availability of workers or increase the cost of such labor 

the negative effects of a strike or work stoppage 

the timing and planning of maintenance projects at customer facilities in the refinery industry which could cause adjustments for seasonal shifts in product demands 

exposure to construction hazards related to the use of heavy equipment with attendant significant risks of liability for personal injury and property damage 

the use of significant production estimates for determining percent complete on construction contracts could produce different results upon final determination of project scope 

the inherent inaccuracy of estimates used to project the timing and cost of exiting operations of non core businesses

exited operations fiscal year on march   matrix entered into a letter of intent with caldwell tanks  inc for the sale of brown  a subsidiary acquired in in april  the board of directors approved the transaction and a stock purchase agreement was executed on june  based upon certain environmental concerns see item business environmental  the structure of this transaction is being renegotiated as an asset sale with matrix retaining temporary ownership of the land and buildings until environmental remediation is completed 
also  in may senior management approved and committed matrix to an exit plan related to the slt operations which were acquired in the exit plan specifically identified all significant actions to be taken to complete the exit plan  listed the activities that would not be continued  and outlined the methods to be employed for the disposition  with an expected completion date of march management obtained board approval and immediately began development of a communication plan to the impacted employees under workers adjustment and retraining notification act warn act 
in june of  notices were given as required under the warn act and matrix announced that it would also pursue potential opportunities to sell slt 
as a result of these restructuring  impairment and abandonment operations  matrix recorded a charge of million see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year during the third quarter of fiscal year  the board of directors approved a plan whereby matrix would exit the operations of midwest and discontinue to operate in the markets that midwest has historically participated 
matrix completed all open contracts and disposed of all assets of midwest 
during each of the fiscal years ended and  midwest had operating losses of million and million respectively 
also during the third quarter of fiscal  matrix adopted a board of directors approved plan to restructure operations to reduce costs  eliminate duplication of facilities and improve efficiencies 
the plan included closing fabrication shops in newark  delaware and rancocas  new jersey and moving these operations to a more efficient and geographically centered facility in bristol  pennsylvania 
additionally  the company closed a fabrication shop at elkston  maryland 
the production from the maryland facility  which was principally elevated water tanks  will be provided by the company s newnan  georgia plant 
the facilities located in delaware  new jersey  pennsylvania and maryland were all leased facilities 
matrix sold real estate that was not being utilized in mississauga  canada  and terminated the business of certain product lines that were no longer profitable 
as part of the restructuring plan matrix separately reviewed the operations of slt for impairment indicators as actual operating and cash flow results were less than projections for fiscal  the principals in management  from whom the original business was purchased  left the employment of the company in early fiscal  slt reputation in the industry had deteriorated and the business name was dissolved into matrix 
the operating income and cash flows from this business unit were not historically negative  however  there were significant concerns that future operations may not be positive 
based on these potential impairment indicators  an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows of the slt operations was made 
this estimate indicated impairment and  as a result  the entire amount of the goodwill related to slt was written off 
additionally  in evaluating matrix s mayflower vapor seal operations  the operating income and cash flows from this business unit indicated that positive amounts were not attainable 
therefore  the businesses was completely abandoned  the goodwill written off  and impaired assets abandoned or sold at their net realizable value 
the operating results of mayflower were not significant to matrix s operations 
employee termination costs associated with the reorganization and termination of all employees of midwest and mayflower were recognized and paid during fiscal other reorganization costs include the cost of travel related expenses for reorganization teams which proposed  planned and carried out the company s restructuring plans  cost of a failed merger with iteq and equipment moving 
as a result of these restructuring and closing operations  matrix recorded a charge of million see footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
municipal water services vs 
revenues for municipal water services in were million  a slight decrease of million  or as compared to due principally to weak market demand in the flat bottom water tank sector 
gross margin for of was significantly worse than the produced in as a result of major weakness in the markets  intensified competition  poor execution of job plans and the inefficiency experienced during the selling and shutdown process 
included in margins was the impact of losses accrued on jobs yet to be completed of million 
these margin declines along with the slightly decreased sales volumes resulted in gross profit for of million  a million decrease from operating losses for of million were significantly worse than the operating losses of million  in as a result primarily of lower gross profits discussed above and restructuring impairment and abandonment costs of million relating to the decision to exit the business versus a restructuring  impairment and abandonment charge of million in relating to the impairment of goodwill at slt 
municipal water services vs 
revenues for municipal water services in were million  a decrease of million or from  primarily as a result of a softening in the new construction market

selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of revenues was relatively flat at in vs 
in operating losses for of million were significantly worse than the operating income of million produced in as a direct result of gross profit shortfalls discussed above and a million charge for restructuring  impairment and abandonment costs in relating to the impairment of goodwill at slt 
fccu services vs 
midwest was exited in the third quarter of and there was no significant fccu activity in fccu services vs 
after an extensive analysis of the market and an evaluation of midwest s ability to compete in that market  management made the decision to terminate the operations of midwest effective february  additionally  the decision was made to exit the market for structural work on fccu s and refractory linings for hydrocarbon processing vessels  which is substantially the revenue base for midwest 
revenue for midwest was million in fiscal as compared with million for the full year ending may  or a decrease of million or 
the decline was primarily the result of weak market conditions and the decision to exit the business in the third quarter of fiscal gross margin for midwest in fiscal of was significantly worse than the produced in as a direct result of poor execution of job plans and the inefficiencies associated with the close down of the business 
these margin shortfalls along with decreased sales volumes resulted in gross profit for declining from levels by million 
financial condition liquidity matrix s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million at may  and million at may  matrix has financed its operations recently with cash generated by operations and advances under a credit agreement 
matrix has a credit agreement with a commercial bank under which a total of million may be borrowed 
matrix may borrow up to million on a revolving basis based on the level of the company s eligible receivables 
revolving loans bear interest at a prime rate or a libor based option  and mature on october  at may   there were no outstanding advances under the revolver 
the credit agreement also provides for a term loan up to million 
on march   a term loan of million was made to matrix 
the term loan is due on february  and is to be repaid in equal payments beginning in march at an interest rate based upon the prime rate or a libor option 
at may  the balance outstanding on the term loan was million 
in conjunction with the term loan effective march   matrix entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a commercial bank  effectively providing a fixed interest rate of for the five year period of the term loan 
operations of the company provided million of cash for the year ended may  as compared with providing million of cash for the year ended may   representing a increase of approximately million 
the increase was due primarily to changes in net working capital for the year 
capital expenditures during the year ended may  totaled approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million was used to purchase transportation equipment for field operations  and approximately million was used to purchase welding  construction  and fabrication equipment 
matrix has invested approximately million in office equipment furniture and fixtures during the year  which includes approximately million invested for a new enterprise wide management information system 
matrix has budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures for fiscal of this amount  approximately million would be used to purchase transportation equipment for field operations  and approximately million would be used to purchase welding  construction  and fabrication equipment 
a  square foot expansion is planned for the port of catoosa fabrication facility at a cost of approximately million and an additional million is anticipated to be spent on the enterprise wide management information system 
matrix expects to be able to finance these expenditures with operating cash flow and borrowings under the credit agreement 
matrix believes that its existing funds  amounts available from borrowings under its existing credit agreement  and cash generated by operations and through the sale of brown will be sufficient to meet the working capital needs through fiscal and thereafter unless significant expansions of operations not now planned are undertaken  in which case matrix would need to arrange additional financing as a part of any such expansion 
the preceding discussion contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements relating to matrix s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions  and adequate resources  that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements contained in the financial conditions and liquidity section are based on certain assumptions which may vary from actual results 
specifically  the dates on which matrix believes the sale of brown will be consummated and the capital expenditure projections are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the successful remediation of environmental issues to complete the closing of the brown sale and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the successful closing of the brown sale 
qualitative quantitative disclosures year compliance matrix initiated an enterprise wide project on to address the year compliance issue for both traditional and non traditional technology areas 
the project focuses on all technology hardware  software  external interfaces with customers and suppliers  and facility items 
the phases of the project are awareness  assessment  remediation  and implementation 
matrix has completed its inventory and assessment efforts 
during the assessment phase  all systems were inventoried and classified into five categories business applications  end user applications  development tools  hardware and system software and non it systems 
each system also was assigned one of three priorities critical  necessary  or low 
based on assessment results  matrix determined that it would be required to modify  upgrade or replace only a limited number of its systems so that its business areas would function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
as of may   all critical and necessary systems have been remediated and implemented in the production environment 
remediation of the low priority systems is substantially complete 
these systems represent a minor portion of the inventory and have been considered to have no material impact on the operations of the business 
matrix has minimal external interface systems  however  communications have been initiated with significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which these companies are addressing year compliance 
in connection with this activity  matrix has processed approximately letters and questionnaires with external parties 
as of may   approximately percent of the companies contacted have responded and all of these have indicated that they are already compliant or will be compliant on a timely basis 
the anticipated cost of the year effort has been estimated at  and is being funded through operating cash flows 
of the total project cost  is attributable to the purchase of new systems  which will be capitalized 
the remaining will be expensed as incurred  is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations 
as of may   expended project costs were approximately  matrix estimates any future costs will not exceed despite the best planning and execution efforts  matrix is working from the premise that some issues will not be uncovered  and that some issues that are uncovered will not be successfully resolved 
in an effort to manage and mitigate this risk exposure  matrix has developed a risk management and contingency plan for its critical operations 
in addition to matrix s remediation strategy  a new enterprise wide management information system has been purchased as a replacement for the core financial and operational systems 
the project began in january and has an estimated duration of nine months 
the scope of this project has been maintained separately and independent of matrix s year efforts 
if the existing remediation strategy fails  this project could be escalated to mitigate any material business disruptions 
all critical systems over which matrix has control are planned to be compliant and tested before year however  matrix has identified the possibility of service disruptions due to non compliance by third parties as the area equating to the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
for example  power failures and telecommunication outages would cause service interruptions 
it is not possible to quantify the possible financial impact if this most reasonably likely worst case scenario were to come to fruition 
the preceding discussion contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements relating to matrix s plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions  and adequate resources  that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements contained in the year update are based on certain assumptions which may vary from actual results 
specifically  the dates on which matrix believes the year project will be completed and computer systems will be implemented are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved  or that there will not be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of the year project 
other specific factors that might cause differences between the estimates and actual results include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in these areas  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer code  timely responses to and corrections by third parties and suppliers  the ability to implement interfaces between the new systems and the systems not being replaced  and similar uncertainties 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the year problem  resulting in large part from the uncertainty of the year readiness of third parties  matrix cannot ensure its ability to timely and cost effectively resolve problems associated with the year issue that may affect its operations and business  or expose it to third party liability

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures interest rate risk matrix s interest rate risk exposure primarily results from its debt portfolio which is influenced by short term rates  primarily prime rate and libor based borrowings under its credit agreement 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  matrix utilizes interest rate swaps to change the ratio of its fixed and variable rate debt portfolio based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and matrix s ability to access the capital markets as necessary 
the following table provides information about matrix s long term debt and interest rate swap that is subject to interest rate risk 
for long term debt  the table presents principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for the interest rate swap  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the interest rate swap 
fair value fair value may may  may  interest rate swap pay fixed receive      variable pay rate receive rate day libor london interbank offer rate plus basis points foreign currency risk matrix has subsidiary companies whose operations are located in canada and venezuela 
matrix s financial results could be affected if these companies incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions in these foreign countries 
matrix attempts to mitigate these risks by investing in different countries and business segments 
venezuela s currency has recently suffered significant devaluation and volatility 
the ultimate severity of the conditions in venezuela remain uncertain  as does the long term impact on matrix s investment  however  the total investment in venezuela is not material to the financial position of matrix taken as a whole
