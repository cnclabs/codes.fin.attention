year issue state of readiness in mid  the company initiated a project to address any potential business disruptions related to data processing problems as a result of the year issue 
initially  the project focused primarily on the company s information technology it systems 
however  the project was subsequently expanded to include non it systems including transportation and warehouse refrigeration systems  telecommunications  utilities  etc 
the project consists of a number of phases awareness  assessment  programming testing and implementation 
with respect to it systems  the company has completed the first three phases and is approximately complete with the implementation phase 
the company expects to complete the implementation phase for it systems during the third quarter of with respect to non it systems  the company is in the assessment phase to identify all critical systems requiring remediation and is developing a timetable for remediation based upon that assessment 
as part of the year project  the company has initiated communications with its significant merchandise suppliers and major customers to assess their state of readiness for the year a significant percentage of suppliers and customers have provided the company with written responses regarding their state of year readiness 
the company is continuing to evaluate key business processes to identify any additional non it systems requiring remediation and to work with key suppliers and customers in preparing for the year despite this continuing effort  the company can provide no assurance that the it and non it systems of third party business partners with whom the company relies upon will be year compliant 
costs in addition to the year project  the company has underway a project to standardize the computer systems at nine of its broadline distribution subsidiaries  which operate in a distributed computing environment 
the decision to standardize the computer system used in these subsidiaries was based on the company s continued growth and need to capture information to improve operating efficiencies and capitalize on the company s combined purchasing power 
the plan to standardize these systems was not accelerated by the year issue 
additionally  one of the company s distribution subsidiaries  which operates four distribution facilities  processes information in a centralized computing environment 
therefore  the company s year remediation efforts have been minimized by focusing its year programming on two primary operating systems 
the company anticipates incurring approximately  related to remediating its it systems for year compliance  of which the company has incurred approximately  to date 
the company has not completed quantifying the remediation costs regarding non it systems 
year remediation costs are being expensed as incurred over the life of the project and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
risks and contingency plans the company is currently assessing the consequences of its it and non it remediation efforts not being completed timely or its efforts not being successful 
as part of this assessment process  the company is developing contingency plans including plans to address interruption of merchandise and services supplied to customers and supplied by third party business partners 
the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario related to the readiness of it systems is that the implementation of the year compliant system in all nine subsidiaries may not be completed timely 
the company s contingency plans in this case include backup plans to process transactions for non compliant subsidiaries through one of the company s year compliant systems 
the company is still formulating these contingency plans 
with respect to risks associated with third party merchandise suppliers  the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that some of the company s merchandise suppliers may have difficulty filling orders and shipping products 
the company believes the risk associated with merchandise suppliers year readiness is mitigated by the significant number of company relationships with alternative suppliers within various product categories  which could be substituted in the event of non compliance 
the company also believes the number of non compliant merchandise suppliers will be minimized through its program of communicating with key suppliers and assessing their state of year readiness 
the company has not yet completed its identification and assessment of all non it systems requiring remediation  including various service providers 
as the company s year project continues  the company will continue to develop contingency plans and identify alternative business processes and sources of supply for goods and services 
the company s project and related assessment of costs and risks are based on current estimates and assumptions  including the outcome of future events regarding the continued availability of certain resources  the timing and effectiveness of third party remediation efforts and other factors 
there can be no assurance that the company s contingency plans or its efforts with respect to third party business partners will be successful  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
