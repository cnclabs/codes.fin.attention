overview we are a leading developer and publisher of branded interactive entertainment software 
our software products operate on several multimedia platforms including personal computers  the sony playstation and nintendo n video game consoles  and the internet 
we are also developing software for the nintendo game boy color and are planning to develop software for next generation video game consoles 
we plan to continue to extend our popular brands across multiple categories  or genres  and platforms 
these brands include army men  battletanx  family game pack  heroes of might and magic  high heat baseball  and might and magic  many of which have won industry awards 
our software products cover a variety of genres  including action  strategy  adventure role playing  sports and family entertainment 
we develop our software internally in our company owned studios and have created an extensive portfolio of versatile technologies that allow us to develop new software titles more quickly and cost effectively 
we were incorporated in california in september and commenced operations in october in april  we reorganized as a delaware holding company and acquired an entity that had developed our hardware technology 
we acquired cyclone studios in november  archetype interactive corporation in may and certain assets of new world computing  inc in june we currently have an active subsidiary in the united kingdom  do europe  ltd 
we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission on june  in connection with a proposed public offering of up to million of our common stock software publishing revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of software titles published and distributed by us and license fees for software developed by us and manufactured  marketed and distributed by third party licensees in europe  latin america  asia and australia 
software publishing revenues are net of allowances for returns  price protection and discounts 
software publishing revenues are recognized at the time of shipment  provided that we have no related outstanding obligations 
software licensing revenues are typically recognized when we fulfill our obligations  such as delivery of the product master under a distribution agreement 
per copy royalties that exceed guaranteed minimum royalty levels are recognized as earned 
we recognize revenue from our meridian online service monthly upon customers usage 
cost of software publishing revenues consists primarily of direct costs associated with software titles  including manufacturing costs and royalties payable to platform developers such as sony and nintendo and  to a lesser extent  royalties payable to third party developers 
cost of revenues for interactive entertainment software varies significantly by platform 
cost of revenues for video game console titles is typically higher than cost of revenues for personal computer titles due to relatively higher manufacturing and royalty costs associated with these products 
cost of revenues for personal computer titles primarily consists of the cost of the cd rom and packaging 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and support costs 
internal development costs of software titles are expensed as incurred and included in research and development expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and retail marketing support  sales commissions  sales and marketing personnel costs and other costs 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenditures to develop our business in the future 
we expect that our operating results will fluctuate as a result of a wide variety of factors  including the factors described in risk factors 
as of march   we had cumulative federal net operating loss carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes  which if not offset against future taxable income  will expire in fiscal through as of march   we had cumulative california net operating loss carryforwards of million  which if not offset against future taxable income  will expire in fiscal through exit from hardware systems operations our initial business model was to license our technology to hardware manufacturers and software developers to enable the establishment of a bit  cd rom based  interactive video entertainment platform  the do interactive multiplayer system 
the do multiplayer was launched in october  but failed to achieve significant market acceptance 
all of our hardware licensees have ceased manufacturing and distributing the do multiplayer and all third party software development for the platform has also ceased 
in december  we licensed our bit next generation m technology to matsushita electric industrial co  ltd 
for an upfront license fee of million plus royalties 
revenue from this transaction was recognized using the percentage of completion method 
in april  we agreed to modify the m system design in exchange for approximately million paid in installments in fiscal and in july  we relinquished our rights to develop and distribute software and peripherals compatible with hardware products developed by matsushita or its sublicensees that incorporate the m technology  develop and distribute m compatible authoring systems  and receive royalties with respect to matsushita s potential use of the m technology 
in exchange  matsushita returned to us approximately million shares of our common stock 
we recognized million of non cash revenues in connection with this transaction in fiscal in february  we agreed to modify the three dimensional graphics portion of our m technology related to semiconductors and licensed it to cirrus logic  inc we received million that we recognized as revenue under the percentage of completion method 
in october  in settlement of litigation  cirrus paid us to satisfy its past and future license fees  and advance royalty and engineering service payment obligations 
we recognized this payment as revenue in fiscal in june  we sold or licensed most of the assets of our former hardware systems group to samsung electronics co 
ltd 
for million 
we recognized a gain of million associated with the sale of these assets 
we then focused our operations on developing and publishing branded interactive entertainment software 
results of software publishing operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data related to our software publishing operations for fiscal  and expressed as a percentage of revenues 
we have not included similar information for our hardware systems operations because we believe that such information is not helpful in understanding our current operations 
year ended march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative in process research and development total operating expenses operating loss net interest and other income loss before taxes fiscal compared to fiscal software publishing revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of new titles released to new titles in fiscal from three new titles in fiscal revenues in fiscal consisted primarily of sales of interactive entertainment software for the personal computer  and to a lesser extent  the sony playstation and the nintendo n revenues in fiscal consisted primarily of sales of personal computer software 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increased number of software titles published in fiscal compared with fiscal gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the release of titles in fiscal which had higher per unit wholesale prices and lower allowances for returns and price protection 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher on going development expenses as we continued to expand our product development efforts and began to develop products for video game console systems in addition to the personal computer 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal as revenues grew at a faster rate than research and development expenses due in part to cost savings from the use of our proprietary tools and technology in developing new products 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to marketing expenses related to the release of ten personal computer titles  three sony playstation titles and one nintendo n title in fiscal  compared to the release of three new personal computer titles in fiscal we also incurred substantial marketing expenses for our television ad campaigns for battletanx for the n and army men d for the playstation in fiscal sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal as revenues grew at a faster rate than sales and marketing expenses due in part to sales of new products in brands for which we were able to take advantage of brand name recognition generated by our previous advertising campaigns 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in the future as additional software titles are released 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in administrative and overhead expenses as we continued to build the infrastructure to support the release of new titles for the personal computer  sony playstation and nintendo n platforms 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future 
net interest and other income 
software publishing has incurred negative cash flows during fiscal and  and we primarily have relied upon cash generated from the sale or license of hardware systems technology to fund software publishing operations 
see notes g and h of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for presentation purposes all net interest and other income expense has been allocated to software publishing 
net interest and other income decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in net interest and other income is primarily due to the decrease in cash and short term investment balances 
hardware systems in fiscal  we licensed and sold substantially all of the assets of our former hardware systems group 
fiscal compared to fiscal software publishing revenues 
revenues were relatively consistent at million in fiscal and million in fiscal we released three new products in fiscal compared with four new products in fiscal cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this absolute dollar decrease and gross margin increase were primarily due to higher royalty expense incurred in fiscal because most of the titles released in fiscal required royalty payments to third party developers  compared to only two of the four titles released in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in headcount in december sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses remained relatively constant from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to relatively constant software publishing revenues and number of new products released 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in headcount in december in process research and development 
in june  we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of new world computing  inc  a personal computer platform game developer in exchange for one million shares of our common stock and million in cash 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
a one time charge of million was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  representing the amount of the purchase price assigned to in process research and development because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no other future alternative uses 
at the time of the acquisition  a total of products were in development 
we estimated that the average aggregate percentage of completion for those products was approximately at the time of the acquisition 
of the products in development  four were subsequently cancelled and four were completed and released  but generated minimal revenues 
the remaining four products were completed and released with modest market success 
however  the average percentage of completion for those products was only approximately at the time of the acquisition 
we used an income approach in valuing the acquired in process research and development 
the income approach reflects the present value of the operating cash flows generated by the in process research and development after taking into account the cost to complete the projects  the relative risk of the projects and an appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value of investment capital 
also included as part of the purchase price were intangibles valued at million  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of approximately five years 
net interest and other income 
net interest and other income decreased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease in net interest and other income is primarily due to a decrease in cash and short term investment balances as a result of cash being used in our operations 
hardware systems royalties and license fees 
royalties and license fee revenues decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues recognized in connection with the m agreement with matsushita were million in fiscal and million in fiscal royalty and license fee revenues also included million related to our agreement with cirrus logic in fiscal and million in fiscal development systems and other 
development systems and other revenues decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the sale of our hardware systems group to samsung in june cost of revenues 
cost of royalties and license fees revenues was million in fiscal we did not record cost of royalties and license fees revenues in fiscal due to the sale of our hardware systems group in fiscal gain on sale of hardware systems assets 
in fiscal  we sold or licensed most of the assets of our former hardware systems group  including certain technologies and related intellectual property rights and approximately million in equipment to samsung for million  realizing a gain of million 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investment balances  which were million at march  and million at march  this decrease was primarily due to net cash used in operations of million and capital expenditures of million in fiscal in july  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan which authorized us to purchase up to million of our stock on the open market or in block trades  from time to time as management deems appropriate  if the market price of our stock remains below certain levels 
as of march   we had reacquired over one million shares 
the repurchase plan will remain in effect until rescinded by our board of directors 
in fiscal  we entered into two line of credit agreements 
our agreement with coast business credit allows us to borrow up to million or of qualified accounts receivable 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at a rate of prime plus as of march  
this line of credit expires in march our agreement with coast business credit contains financial covenants 
see note p of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of march   no borrowings were outstanding under this facility 
our agreement with merrill lynch co 
allows us to borrow up to million or of the cash balance in the pledged collateral account 
borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at a rate of the day commercial paper rate plus as of march  
this line of credit expires in november as of march   the outstanding loan balance was approximately million 
on april   we repaid the outstanding borrowings to merrill lynch and borrowed million from coast business credit 
we expect to continue to incur negative cash flows in fiscal  primarily due to our continued investment in the internal development of entertainment software titles that are scheduled to be released in the next fiscal year and beyond  which include additional capital expenditures primarily for computer equipment 
in addition  we anticipate that a substantial portion of our operating expenses in fiscal will be related to marketing and advertising  as we continue to raise the brand awareness of our products 
we anticipate that the net proceeds of the offering of up to million of our common stock  cash from operations  and available borrowings under our credit facilities should be sufficient to fund our activities for at least the next months 
we cannot be certain that additional capital will not be required in fiscal because cash flows will be affected by the rate at which we release products and the resulting sale of these products  the market acceptance of such products and the levels of advertising and promotions required to promote market acceptance of our products 
the level of financing required beyond fiscal will depend on these and other factors 
if we need to raise additional funds through public or private financing  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
additional financing may result in substantial and immediate dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short or long term capital requirements  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly or to seek funds through arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require us to relinquish material rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets 
year compliance many existing computer systems and related software applications  and other control devices  use only two digits to identify a year in the date field  without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
such systems  applications  and or devices could fail or create erroneous results unless corrected to properly recognize and process data related to the year we rely on such computer systems  applications and devices in operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business  including  but not limited to  our financial systems such as general ledger  billing  accounts payable and payroll modules  customer service  internal networks and telecommunications equipment  and end products 
we also rely  directly and indirectly  on the external systems of various independent business enterprises  such as our customers  licensors  contract manufacturers  suppliers  creditors  and financial organizations  and of governments  both domestically and internationally  for the accurate exchange of data and related information 
we have formed a year working group to organize  manage  and report on our year remediation efforts 
the year working group consists of approximately individuals from all levels of management and covering all areas of our operations 
we have retained an experienced year project manager to lead this working group 
the year working group has identified a four phase approach to determining  addressing  and reporting on year readiness 
this approach is expected to identify areas of operations that could reasonably be expected to have adverse effects on us should they fail to adequately address their own year issues 
phase inventory involves a comprehensive inventory of systems  software  and business relationships 
we have substantially completed inventorying and analyzing our remaining centralized computer and embedded systems to identify any potential year issues and will take corrective action based on the results of analysis 
we have inventoried a representative sample of our desktop hardware and software and consider this phase essentially complete 
an automated final sweep of all desktop hardware and software is scheduled during july this final sweep is a new portion of this phase  added to ensure completeness 
phase risk assessment requires detailed analysis of each item or relationship identified in phase phase remediation planning creates project plans to correct or address individual system  software  or business partner issues identified in the first two phases 
we are replacing or upgrading hardware and software that are known to be year non compliant 
phase remediation implements those plans  correcting or replacing systems  software  or business partners as required 
we have upgraded our financial and accounting systems to the most recent version 
we believe our database and financial applications are year compliant 
these systems are used to automate order entry  accounts receivable  accounts payable  purchasing  fixed asset and general ledger functions 
we have upgraded our electronic data interchange edi systems to be year compliant and have participated in national retail federation nrf testing 
the successful completion of the nrf testing is reflected on the nrf web site 
as of march   our overall progress by phase was as follows percentage expected completed as of completion phase march  date phase inventory july phase risk assessment august phase remediation planning august phase remediation october we are surveying our critical suppliers  licensees  contract manufacturers  distributors  and other vendors to determine if their operations and the products and services that they provide to us are year compliant 
we intend to mitigate our risks with respect to the failure of third parties to be year ready  including developing contingency plans  where practical 
however  such failures remain a possibility and could harm our business 
to date  we have received responses from more than half of our critical suppliers  manufacturers  distributors and other vendors 
these responses have been analyzed as they arrive 
we are in the process of contacting significant parties who have not responded 
in several cases  our business with our customers and suppliers is conducted through the use of edi systems 
in each case where edi is used  we are in the process of conducting electronic testing with these businesses 
we expect that this electronic testing will be completed by august due to the nature of our products  many of them contain no date related processing 
therefore  many of them should not be affected by the year date change 
however  our year working group is in the process of developing tests for all of our significant products to determine the effects of the year change 
we have developed tests for these products and expect to complete testing of all of our current products by july while we expect to find few date related issues with our products  we have not fully identified such impact and may or may not incur expenses related to the remediation of year problems in our existing products 
cost we expect to incur costs during the next three quarters related to the planning and remediation described above 
our current estimate including the year issues identified to date is that the costs associated with the year issue should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in any quarter 
however  we are not certain that we have fully identified such impact or whether we can resolve it without disruption of our business or incurring significant expense 
we have incurred approximately million in expenditures to date related to the year issue 
risks and uncertainties if we fail to find and correct a significant year issue  our normal business operations could be interrupted 
we currently expect to substantially complete remediation and validation of our internal systems  as well as to develop contingency plans for certain internal systems  by the end of the first quarter of fiscal however  if implementation of replacement upgraded systems or software is delayed  if significant new non compliance issues are identified  or if contingency plans fail  our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
our risks include the following software development schedules 
our software development teams rely on a variety of systems and software tools to develop products 
if these systems and tools are not functioning properly  product release schedules  which span the year rollover  could be adversely affected 
we rely on external contractors to develop components of some of our products 
if a contractor with a significant contribution to a project should fail to adequately address the year issue  this could have adverse effects on the development schedule for one or more of our products 
facilities operations 
we rely on systems and software to run our security and telecommunications systems 
although both of these components at all of our locations have been included in the year plan  a failure of either of these systems could prevent normal work at one or more of our locations 
financial and accounting software 
we have upgraded our financial and accounting systems to the most recent available version 
we believe our database and financial applications are year compliant 
although all of these business applications have been and will continue to be thoroughly evaluated for year compliance  a failure in one or more of these software packages could delay our ability to process customer orders  billing  payroll  accounts payable and financial statements 
consequently  we may not be able to file our financial reports with the securities and exchange commission on a timely basis  which could negatively affect our stock price 
production and fulfillment facility 
we use a third party fulfillment center to assemble and distribute our products 
even though our third party fulfillment center is in the process of updating its computer systems to be year compliant  we cannot be certain that its computer systems will be operating properly 
in an event that its computer systems are not functioning properly due to year non compliance and the third party cannot ship products to our customers  our financial position and earnings will be severely impacted 
contingency plans we expect to develop contingency plans for key internal systems and critical business partners by the end of the first quarter of fiscal this contingency planning includes identifying additional vendors who could provide similar goods and services on short notice 
we expect these plans to reduce the risk of interruption  delay or failure of key processes required for business operations 
however  failure of such plans remains a possibility and could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the statements regarding year issues above and in risk factors the year risk may adversely affect us are year readiness disclosures within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the protection of this act does not apply to federal securities fraud actions 
impact of european monetary conversion we are aware of the issues associated with the changes in europe resulting from the formation of a european economic and monetary union emu 
one change resulting from this union required emu member states to irrevocably fix their respective currencies to a new currency  the euro  as of january   at which date the euro became a functional legal currency of these countries 
during the next three years  business in the emu member states will be conducted in both the existing national currency  such as the french franc or the deutsche mark  and the euro 
as a result  companies operating or conducting business in emu member states will need to ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling these currencies  including the euro 
we are still assessing the impact that the conversion to the euro will have on our internal systems  the sale of our products  and the european and global economies 
to date  we have conducted limited sales activities in the european economies 
however  we are planning to significantly expand our operations in europe in fiscal we will take appropriate corrective actions based on the results of such assessment 
we have not yet determined the cost related to addressing this issue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instrments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include fixed rate us government securities  municipal bonds  time deposits and certificates of deposit 
we classify our cash equivalents and short term investments as variable rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term 
these variable rate investments primarily include money market accounts held at various securities brokers and banks 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our investment portfolio at march  average short term investments interest rate cost fair value fixed rate   variable rate see definition in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate fair value of our investment in short term investments as of march   by contractual maturity date  consisted of the following aggregate fair value in thousands due in one year or less  due in one to three years
