impact of inflation and changing prices the company does not believe inflation has had a significant impact on operations  because most of its customer contracts included a cost of living price adjustment provision  or whose costs were primarily fixed at the date of commencement 
the company believes these factors will be sufficient to offset the impact of any future inflation on the company s costs of operation
