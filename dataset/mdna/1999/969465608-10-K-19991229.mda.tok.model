at september   the company s working capital decreased to  compared to  at september   and the current ratio was at september  compared to at september  the decrease in working capital is attributable primarily to the writedown of asset values related to an increase in the estimated loss on disposal for the agriculture equipment segment  the  short term bridge loan for the acquisition of proactive  and increased accounts payable at september   partly due to significant capital expenditures made during the fourth quarter 
cash increased  at september  compared to september  as a result of a large payment from a customer received on september net deferred income tax assets increased  from  at september  to  at september   primarily due to an increase in the estimated loss on disposal of the agricultural equipment segment and the loss from impairment of assets of the automotive accessories segment

the company had available under its revolving credit facility with a bank at september  at september   the bank waived compliance with all financial covenants as the company was out of compliance at september  with its covenants under its borrowing arrangement 
the waivers were obtained in a manner that allows the company s debt to be classified as current and long term based on the payment terms of the loans at september  market risk the company has not entered into derivative financial instruments 
the company may be exposed to future interest rate changes on its debt 
the company does not believe that a hypothetical percent change in end of period interest rates would have a material effect on the company s cash flow 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is an amendment to sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for all derivative instruments 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not have any derivative instruments and accordingly  the adoption of sfas will have no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
year conversion the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by year software failures 
software failures due to processing errors potentially arising from calculations using the year date are a known risk 
the company has addressed the risk to the availability and integrity of financial systems and the reliability of the operational systems 
the company has established processes for evaluating and managing the risks and costs associated with this problem  including communicating with suppliers  dealers and others with which it does business to coordinate year conversion 
during  the company began implementing the installation of new financial software that is year compliant for the purpose of improving operations and service to its existing and prospective truck and automotive customers 
this task has been completed in the decision to upgrade the company s software was made irrespective of year compliance issues 
since january   the company has been engaged in achieving year compliance 
the company s year project is divided into several phases and corrective actions for major systems are complete 
all hardware  software  services and business relationships with trading partners that could be affected by year issues were tested for year compliance 
the company relies on computer systems and software to operate its business  including applications used in sales  purchasing  inventory management  finance and various administrative functions 
the company had determined that certain of its software applications would be unable to interpret appropriately the calendar year and subsequent years 
as of december   of the company s mission critical systems that may have a material year liability are year compliant 
the company s amended budget for its year project is  all of which had been spent through december the company acquires a majority of its inventory from approximately of its vendors 
if these vendors have unresolved year issues that affect their ability to supply merchandise  the company could be adversely affected 
the company conducted an assessment of vendors whose potential year liability could materially affect operations 
based on this assessment the company believes that it is not materially at risk from a year liability posed by its vendors 
in the event a vendor s ability to supply the company is adversely affected by year issues  the company believes that it will be able to find alternative suppliers 
should there be a mission critical system  not previously identified as such  that becomes a year liability or should a vendor unexpectedly experience year issues which adversely affect its ability to supply merchandise  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
however  the company believes that the financial impact would not be material since all systems believed by the company to be critical are year compliant and the company believes it is not materially at risk from a negative impact as a result of a year liability caused by a vendor 
risks despite the company s efforts to identify all internal systems with year issues  it is likely that unexpected problems will arise 
as with most businesses  the company will also be at risk from external infrastructure failures that could arise from year failures 
it is possible  for example  that electrical power  telephone and financial networks across the nation will experience breakdowns in the days and weeks following january  there is also a real possibility of failures of key components in the national transportation infrastructure or delays in rail  over the road and air shipments due to failures in transportation control systems due to the year problem 
investigation and assessment of risks associated with such ubiquitous and interconnected utility systems and transportation systems are beyond the resources of the company 
the failure by the company or third parties to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain of the company s normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition
