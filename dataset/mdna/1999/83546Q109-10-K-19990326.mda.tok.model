item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
when used in this discussion  the words expects  anticipates  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements  which include statements concerning the timing of availability and functionality of products under development  product mix  trends in average selling prices  trends in the pc market  the percentage of export sales and sales to strategic customers and the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below under factors that may affect our results  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin loss operating expenses research and development selling  marketing and administrative other operating expense total operating expenses income loss from operations gain on sale of joint venture other income expense income loss before income taxes and equity in income of manufacturing joint venture provision benefit for income taxes income loss before equity in income of manufacturing joint venture equity in income from manufacturing joint venture net income loss net sales the company s net sales to date have been generated from the sale of its graphics and multimedia accelerators 
the company s products are used in  and its business is dependent on  the personal computer industry with sales primarily in the us  asia and europe 
net sales were million in  a decrease of from million in net sales for consisted primarily of the company s d and d products 
sales decreased from to because of declining unit average selling prices due to aggressive pricing from certain of the company s competitors  the sale of older generation products at lower prices  a significant decrease in unit volumes and the lack of products available at the high end of the market 
the company expects that the percentage of its net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period as new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 
due to competitive price pressures  the company s products experience declining unit average selling prices over time  which at times can be substantial 
the company s savage family of products is expected to address the mainstream graphics market 
net sales were million in  a decrease from million in net sales for consisted primarily of the company s virge and trio families of integrated accelerators 
the decrease in sales from to was a result of declining unit average selling prices due to aggressive pricing from certain of the company s competitors as well as the sale of older generation products  offset by an increase in unit shipments 
the company s virge family of d d and trio d accelerators continue to experience decreases in average selling prices 
as a result of the entry of competitors into the d acceleration market  the company has experienced and anticipates that it may continue to experience increased pricing pressures on average selling prices for the virge family of d d and trio d accelerators 
if the company is unable to introduce and successfully market higher performance products  if the company s products do not achieve market acceptance or if the pricing pressures increase above normal anticipated levels  the company s operating results could be adversely affected 
export sales accounted for  and of net sales in  and respectively 
approximately of export sales in were to affiliates of united states customers 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurance that export sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current levels 
all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
three customers accounted for  and of net sales in three customers accounted for  and of net sales in two customers accounted for and of net sales in the company expects a significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company s largest customer in was the company s largest asian distributor  and more than of the company s net sales were made through distributors 
gross margin the company had a negative gross margin percentage of in and gross margin percentages of and in and  respectively 
the negative gross margin in was impacted by decreases in overall average selling prices of the virge and trio family of accelerators 
also impacting the negative gross margin were charges for excess and obsolete inventory  lower of cost or market reserves established for the company s d and d products  a million charge for underutilized prepaid production capacity and yield losses 
the gross margin in was impacted by decreases in overall average selling prices of the bit trio family and virge family of accelerators  which resulted in part from the increased proportion of the company s export sales to asian customers and the substantial price competition experienced in the asian market 
in addition  the company did not offer products addressing the high performance d acceleration market  which adversely affected the company s gross margin 
these factors were offset in part by the decrease in unit average costs resulting from the company s foundries conversion to inch wafer utilizing 
micron technology 
in the future  the company s gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decreases in the unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  changes in the mix of products sold  the extent to which the company forfeits or utilizes its production capacity rights with tsmc  the extent to which the company will incur additional licensing fees and shifts in sales mix between add in card and motherboard manufacturers and systems oems 
the company expects gross margin to increase in as the result of new product introductions 
research and development expenses the company has made and intends to continue to make significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in research and development expenses for reflect approximately million in charges for the company s discontinued audio and communications product lines and the write offs of idle  excess and obsolete capital equipment associated with research and development projects terminated during the year 
excluding these charges  research and development expenses decreased from to as a result of reductions in engineering staff due to discontinuing certain product lines during the year 
the increase in research and development expenses from to reflect additions to the company s engineering staff and initial product verification and nonrecurring engineering expenses related to the introduction of new products  including product development for the desktop  mobile and home pc markets 
the company expects research and development expenses in absolute dollars to decrease in selling  marketing and administrative expenses selling  marketing and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in selling  marketing and administrative headcount decreased by and commission expense decreased by approximately million from to from to selling  marketing and administrative headcount increased by and marketing spending increased million which included costs associated with the introduction of new products 
other operating expense other operating expense in includes a write off of acquired technologies of million  a charge for impairment of long lived assets of million and a restructuring charge of million 
in january  the company entered into a million technology exchange with cirrus logic  inc to obtain graphic functionality technologies 
as a result of the exchange  the company acquired the technology covered by graphic patents and graphic patent applications  as well as cross licensed cirrus logic s remaining patents 
under the terms of the cross licensing provisions  the company and cirrus logic have a perpetual license to each other s graphic patents and additional licenses with respect to the other party s patents for agreed upon periods of time 
the company wrote off million of the value of the acquired technologies that were not realizable based on estimated cash flows from the sale of products currently sold by the company 
the remaining million intangible asset was being amortized to cost of sales based on the estimated lives of the currently utilized core technologies  which was generally five years until the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  management reevaluated the carrying value of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the technology exchange with cirrus logic  inc  and related to the patents obtained from brooktree  as well as other long lived assets  including property and equipment 
this revaluation was necessitated by management s determination based on recent results of operations and that the future expected sales and cash flows for the company s operations would be substantially lower than had been previously expected by management 
expected undiscounted future cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
accordingly  an impairment loss of million  representing the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the assets  was recognized for write downs of a substantial portion of the intangible assets 
the estimated fair value of the intangible assets was based on management s best estimate of the patent portfolio based on a comparison to other graphics technology portfolios in the marketplace 
the company determined that no write down of property and equipment was necessary at december  based on its estimate of the fair value of such assets 
due to technological changes in the graphics marketplace  the company concluded it should accelerate its amortization of its remaining patent portfolio  of approximately million  over the current estimated life of the currently utilized core technologies  which is two years 
in july  the company implemented a restructuring plan in order to align resources with a new business model and to lower the company s overall cost structure 
in connection with the restructuring  the company reduced its headcount and consolidated facilities 
severance and related benefits represented the reduction of approximately employees  of which have been paid and separated from the company as of december  all severance packages will be paid by the end of the second quarter of the number of temporary employees and contractors used by the company was also reduced 
the restructuring expense included the write off and write down in carrying value of equipment  which consists primarily of workstations  personal computers and furniture  that will no longer be utilized in the company s operations 
these assets were written down to their estimated fair value less cost to sell 
facility closure expenses were incurred as a result of the company s plan to vacate one of two leased buildings at the company s headquarters facility and include leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and network costs 
the company plans to complete its move by the end of the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company wrote off approximately million of intangible assets including certain licenses  patents and other technology  as a result of management s decision to focus attention on the core graphics business 
as a result of this decision  no future cash flows were expected related to these assets 
gain on sale of manufacturing joint venture on december   the company entered into an agreement with umc to sell to umc million shares of stock of usc for a purchase price of billion new taiwan dollars 
the company received the purchase price approximately million in cash in january upon closing 
the gain on the sale of stock in usc was million 
other income expense  net other expense  net  increased in to million from million in the increase was primarily the result of write offs of certain equity investments in technology companies 
other expense  net  decreased in to million of expense from million of income in the decrease is attributable to the interest expense incurred on million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which were issued by the company in september  as well as lower average cash and short term investments balances  which resulted in a decrease in interest income 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate for was a benefit of  compared to the and effective tax rates for and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for reflects the expected benefits of current year loss carrybacks net of the establishment of a valuation allowance in against the beginning of the year balance of net deferred tax assets 
the tax rate reflects the full benefit of operating losses at statutory rates plus the benefit of tax credits generated 
liquidity and capital resources cash and equivalents and short term investments increased in by million to million from million at the end of the company used million for operating activities and used million for investing activities in in addition  the company used million of cash for financing activities 
cash used for operating activities was million in  as compared to million in the company s operating loss of million was offset by non cash charges including deferred income taxes  depreciation  amortization  loss on the disposal of equipment  write off of prepaid production capacity  the utilization of production capacity rights  write off of impaired assets and the write off of acquired technologies 
the company sold a portion of its interest in usc during and recognized a gain of million 
in addition the company recognized million in income from their equity investment in usc 
the non cash charges were offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable decreased as a result of lower net sales by the company while inventories decreased as the result of lower production volumes and charges taken during for excess and obsolete inventory  lower of cost or market reserves and yield losses 
accounts payable decreased as a direct result of lower inventory purchases 
cash used for operating activities was million in  as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in the decrease in was due to lower net income  an increase in inventories  prepaid expenses and other and a decrease in accounts payable  partially offset by a write off of impaired assets and a decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in inventories was due to the company s effort to reduce the amount of inventory in the channel  which resulted in increased inventories on hand at december  the decrease in accounts receivable was a result of lower sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of investing activities for the years ended december   and used million  million and million  respectively 
the primary investing activities in included million used in a patent purchase and cross licensing agreement with cirrus logic  inc  million of property and equipment purchases  million of short term investment purchases  offset by million of maturities of short term investments and million from the sale of a portion of the company s joint venture in usc 
the company s primary investing activities in included million of property and equipment purchases  million of short term investment purchases  offset by million of maturities of short term investments 
the primary investing activities in included million of property and equipment purchases  million of short term investment purchases and a million investment in the usc joint venture offset by million of maturities of short term investments 
the company expects capital requirements for to be consistent with those for financing activities used cash of million in and provided cash of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily the result of the million repayment of notes payable 
financing activities in included the sales of common stock pursuant to employee stock option and stock purchase plans as well as million in borrowings on notes payable 
this million source of funds in was repaid in the increase in primarily reflects the offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes completed in september net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately million 
in  the company entered into two long term manufacturing capacity arrangements 
the company entered into an agreement with umc and alliance semiconductor corporation to form usc  a separate taiwanese company  for the purpose of building and managing a semiconductor manufacturing facility in the science based industrial park in hsin chu city  taiwan  republic of china 
the company invested million in and million in for its equity interest 
on december   the company entered into an agreement with umc to sell to umc million shares of stock of usc for a purchase price of billion new taiwan dollars 
the company received the purchase price approximately million in cash in january upon closing 
as a result of the january sale to umc  s s percentage ownership in usc decreased to 
under the terms of the agreement  if at any time a liquidity event occurs  s will be entitled to receive  in addition to the initial payment of billion new taiwan dollars  a contingent payment of up to new taiwan dollars per share  or up to an additional billion new taiwan dollars approximately us million at exchange rates prevailing on december  
a liquidity event is defined as any event by which umc  or its successor  will have the opportunity to receive value from transfer of its ownership of shares of stock in usc in an arms length transaction other than by way of transfer to employees for incentives  whether or not umc or its successor  in fact  participates in such opportunity 
a liquidity event will include  for example  completion of a public offering of usc securities on a recognized securities exchange  a sale of usc stock owned by umc or by a umc successor in an arms length transaction  or a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of usc 
the facility commenced production utilizing advanced submicron semiconductor manufacturing processes in late the company has the right to purchase up to of the output from the foundry 
in addition  the company expanded and formalized its relationship with tsmc to provide additional capacity over the to timeframe 
the agreement with tsmc requires the company to make certain annual advance payments to be applied against the following year s capacity 
the company has signed promissory notes to secure these payments  which total million as of december   over the term of the agreement 
the company made no payments in  and paid million in and million in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
working capital at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
at december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
at december   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and equivalents of million and million in short term investments 
additionally  the company had a million unsecured revolving line of credit at december  the line of credit was cancelled during in addition  the company had available two separate secured equipment lines of credit totaling million 
the company terminated these lines during the company had million outstanding under these secured equipment lines of credit at december  the company was required to maintain certain financial covenants in connection with these lines of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its available funds will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months  other than expenditures for future potential manufacturing agreements 
in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  the company has entered into and will continue to consider various possible transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts that commit the company to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods  equity investments in  advances or issuances of equity securities to wafer manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct wafer fabrication facilities 
manufacturing arrangements such as these may require substantial capital investments  which may require the company to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on satisfactory terms 
in addition  the company may  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  invest in or acquire businesses  technology or products that complement the business of the company 
the company is currently a party to certain legal proceedings 
litigation could result in substantial expense to the company 
see item legal proceedings 
year compliance as a result of computer programs being written using two digits  rather than four  to represent year dates  the performance of the company s computer systems and those of its suppliers and customers in the year is uncertain 
any computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in other normal business activities 
the company s plans to address the year issue involve the following phases i inventory risk assessment  ii remediation  iii testing and iv full compliance and or the creation of contingency plans 
the company has completed an inventory and assessment of its systems for year readiness 
the assessment indicated that most of the company s significant information technology systems could be affected  particularly the general ledger  billing and inventory systems 
that assessment also indicated that software and hardware embedded chips used in development  production and manufacturing systems also are at risk 
based on a review of its product line  the company believes that its products do not require remediation to be year compliant 
accordingly  the company believes that the company s products will not expose the company to material year related liabilities 
the company has also queried its significant supplier and subcontractors that do not share information systems with the company external agents 
although the company is not aware of any external agent with a year issue that would materially affect the company s results of operations or financial condition  the failure of an external agent to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company intends to periodically review its external agents to monitor their progress toward completion of their year compliance 
the company has completed the remediation phase for its information technology systems and expects to complete software reprogramming and replacement in the first half of once software is reprogram med or replaced for a system  the company begins testing and implementation 
these phases run concurrently for different systems 
to date  the company has completed approximately of its testing 
completion of the testing phase for all remediated systems is expected to occur by the first half of  with all remediated systems fully tested and implemented by the second quarter of the company s order entry system interfaces directly with significant third party vendors 
the company is in the process of working with third party vendors to ensure that the company s systems that interface directly with third parties are year compliant by the third quarter of the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  test and implement its software and operating equipment for year modifications 
the company believes that costs for remediation  testing and implementation are not significant 
the company currently has no contingency plans in place in the event it does not complete all phases of the year program 
the company plans to evaluate the status of completion by the first half of and determine whether such a plan is necessary 
the failure of either the company s critical systems or those of its material third parties to be year complaint would result in the interruption of its business  which could have material adverse affect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
factors that may affect our results our operating results may fluctuate our operating results have in the past varied significantly and are expected to vary significantly in the future due to several factors  some of which are beyond our control 
those factors include changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors or suppliers  competitive pressures on average selling prices  the availability and cost of products from our suppliers  changes in the mix of products sold by us or in the mix of distribution channels through which those products are sold  the timing of new product introductions by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  disruptions in our production or shipping processes  the gain or loss of significant customers  seasonal customer demand  the operating results of usc  our manufacturing joint venture  and general economic conditions  including economic conditions in asia in particular  that could affect the timing of customer orders and capital spending and result in order cancellations or rescheduling 
some or all of those factors could adversely affect demand for our products and  therefore  our operating results  in the future 
in addition  we generally ship more products in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  with levels of shipment in the third month higher towards the end of the month 
this pattern  which is common in the semiconductor industry  is likely to continue and makes future quarterly operating results less predictable 
we may not return to profitability we had a net loss of million in our net sales decreased from to and we experienced a negative gross margin in these results occurred primarily because we did not offer competitive products in the high end of the graphics and multimedia accelerator market 
as a result  our sales consisted of sales of primarily older generation and lower price products that were sold into markets that had significant price competition 
we took a charge for excess and obsolete inventory 
our manufacturing yields were lower than expected which required us to take a charge for yield losses 
we also took a million charge for underutilized prepaid production capacity 
we may not be able to return to profitability 
our products are subject to significant pricing pressures prices for graphics accelerators tend to decline over time  and prices for newly introduced products are under significant pricing pressures due in part to aggressive pricing from some of our competitors 
we have experienced and anticipate that we will continue to experience increased pricing pressures on average selling prices for our virge  trio and savage families of accelerators 
we have only recently started to offer a product that spans all volumes of the commercial and consumer pc market the graphics accelerator market is transitioning from d acceleration to d acceleration and products that compete in the high performance segment of that market have higher gross margins than products in the mainstream pc or in the sub  or segment zero  pc market 
we commenced shipment of our savaged product during the third quarter of this product was intended to address the high performance d acceleration market 
however  the savaged failed to achieve significant market acceptance 
we have recently introduced our savage  which is designed to compete in multiple performance segments of the commercial and consumer pc markets of the d acceleration market 
we do not know whether savage will be able to compete successfully in that segment 
if we are not able to introduce and successfully market higher performance products  our gross margin and profitability could be negatively affected 
we may not adequately forecast demand for our products because we are fabless and must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  and because the markets for the our products are volatile and subject to rapid technological and price changes  we might forecast product demand incorrectly and produce excessive or insufficient inventories of particular products 
in addition  our customers may change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty 
if we produce excessive or insufficient inventories of particular products  our operating results could be negatively affected  as they were in we face substantial competition the market for our products is extremely competitive and is characterized by declining selling prices over the life of a particular product and rapid technological changes 
our principal competitors for graphics accelerators include dfx interactive  inc  ati technologies  inc  intel corporation  matrox graphics inc  nvidia corporation  and trident microsystems  inc 
our principal competitors in the multimedia market include the companies just named as well as a number of smaller companies that may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs 
potential competitors in these markets include both large and emerging domestic and foreign semiconductor companies 
in particular  there are a significant number of established and emerging companies that have developed  are developing or have announced plans to develop d graphics chips 
our product offerings may not address the demand for the next generation of accelerators or be competitive 
if we expand our product line to add products with additional functionality  we will encounter substantial competition from established semiconductor companies and may experience competition from companies designing chips based on different technologies 
furthermore  the need of pc manufacturers to rapidly introduce a variety of products aimed at different segments of the pc market may lead to the shift by system oems to the purchase of graphics and multimedia add in cards provided by others 
some of our competitors supply both add in cards and accelerator chips  which may provide those competitors with an advantage over suppliers that offer only accelerator chips 
in addition  some of our potential competitors  such as intel  that supply add in cards and or motherboards may seek to use their card board business to leverage their graphics accelerator business 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater technical  manufacturing  financial and marketing resources than we do 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend upon a number of factors both within and outside of our control  including product performance and quality  product features  product availability  the prices that we charge  the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  the emergence of new graphics and pc standards  the level of customer support we offer  and industry and general economic trends 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully 
our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and keep pace with rapid technological change the pc industry in general  and the market for our products in particular  is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
products in our market typically have a life cycle of to months  with regular reductions of unit average selling prices over the life of a specific product 
the successful development and commercialization of new products required to replace or supplement existing products involve many risks  including the identification of new product opportunities  the successful and timely completion of the development process and the selection of our products by leading systems suppliers and add in card and motherboard manufacturers for design into their products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring to market new products in a timely manner 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies noncompetitive  or that our products will be selected for design into its customers products 
our products are designed to improve the graphics and multimedia performance of pentium based pcs and microsoft windows  windows nt and ibm os operating systems 
we expect that additional specialized graphics processing and general purpose computing capabilities will be integrated into future versions of intel and other pentium based microprocessors and that standard multimedia accelerators in the future will likely integrate memory  system logic  audio  communications or other additional functions 
in particular  intel has announced plans to develop chips that integrate graphics and processor functions to serve the lower cost pc market 
a substantial portion of our sales were derived from products addressing the lower cost pc market  and we anticipate that a substantial portion of our sales will also be derived from products addressing that market 
we have not previously offered either single function or integrated accelerator products that provide these functions  which have traditionally been provided by separate single function chips or chipsets 
we have and will continue to expand the scope of our research and development efforts to provide these functions  which will require the hiring of engineers skilled in the respective areas and additional management and coordination among our design and engineering groups 
alternatively  we may find it necessary or desirable to license or acquire technology to enable us to provide these functions  and there can be no assurance that any such technology will be available for license or purchase on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  there is a limited amount of space on pc motherboards  and companies that offer solutions that provide the greatest amount of functionality within this limited space may have a competitive advantage 
while our strategy is to develop new and enhanced graphics and multimedia accelerator products that will be complementary to present and future versions of intel and other pentium based microprocessors and integrate additional functionality  there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop such new or enhanced products in a timely manner or correctly anticipate the additional functionality that will be needed to compete effectively in this market 
our initial product containing a number of additional functions  plato px  has been discontinued 
there can be no assurance that  if developed  our new or enhanced products that incorporate additional functions will achieve market acceptance 
we are continually developing new products  such as savage  to address changing market needs 
if new products are not brought to market in a timely manner or do not address market needs or achieve market acceptance  then our operating results could be negatively affected 
market acceptance of our products depends upon a number of factors  some of which are significantly beyond our control  such as the acceptance of other components  such as memory  that our products are designed to work with 
we must keep pace with evolving industry standards our products are designed to improve the graphics and multimedia performance of pentium based pcs and microsoft windows  windows nt and ibm os operating systems  the predominant standards in today s pc market 
any shift away from such standards would require us to develop new products 
we cannot be certain that new technological developments or changes in standards will not result in decreased demand for graphics and multimedia accelerators or for our products that are not compatible with such changed standards 
in  for example  there was an absence of an industry standard d graphics api 
as a result  we developed and promoted our proprietary api 
microsoft has since introduced its directd api and silicon graphics has introduced opengl  which have emerged as the standard apis for d acceleration 
while our d accelerators currently support our proprietary api  direct d api and opengl  it is possible that another api will emerge as an industry standard and that our accelerators will not support such a new standard  which would have a materially negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  due to the widespread industry acceptance of intel s microprocessor architecture and interface architecture  including its agp bus  intel exercises significant influence over the pc industry generally 
from time to time  intel significantly modifies its existing technology  architecture and standards 
if we fail to develop products that are compatible with such modifications  that failure would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
likewise  any delay in the public release of information relating to any such modifications could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are a fabless semiconductor company and depend on independent foundries for the manufacture of our products we currently rely on two independent foundries to manufacture all of our products either in finished form or wafer form 
we have a take or pay contract with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and a joint venture foundry  united semiconductor corporation usc 
in  we expanded and formalized our relationship with tsmc to provide additional capacity over the to time frame 
the foundry agreement with tsmc requires us to make certain annual advance payments to purchase certain committed capacity amounts to be applied against the following year s capacity or forfeit advance payments against such amounts 
in the fourth quarter  we wrote off approximately million of the prepaid production capacity because we did not fully utilize the capacity related to the advance payment 
our current note payable to tsmc is million 
during  we commenced negotiations with tsmc to modify and amend the foundry agreement 
although the terms have not been finalized  we are requesting tsmc to reduce its option capacity and extend the term of the agreement 
if we purchase excess inventories of particular products or choose to forfeit advance payments  our operating results could be negatively affected 
we conduct business with one of our current foundries by delivering written purchase orders specifying the particular product ordered  quantity  price  delivery date and shipping terms 
this foundry is therefore not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
to the extent a foundry terminates its relationship with us or our supply from a foundry is interrupted or terminated for any other reason  such as a natural disaster or an injunction arising from alleged violations of third party intellectual property rights  we may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain sufficient advanced process technology foundry capacity to meet customer demand in the future 
from time to time we may evaluate potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries has in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated  and there can be no assurance that such sources will be able or willing to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or per unit prices 
tsmc and usc are both located in the science based industrial park in hsin chu city  taiwan 
we currently expect these foundries to supply the substantial portion of our products in disruption of operations at these foundries for any reason  including work stoppages  fire  earthquakes or other natural disasters  would cause delays in shipments of our products  and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  as a result of the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry based in the science based industrial park  severe constraints have been placed on the water and electricity supply in that region 
any shortages of water or electricity could adversely affect our foundries ability to supply our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we are subject to the risk of operating losses from our joint venture we currently own of usc and maintain the right to purchase up to of usc s output 
if usc experiences operating losses  we will recognize our proportionate share of those losses and may be required to contribute additional capital 
we believe that a number of manufacturers are expanding or planning to expand their fabrication capacity over the next several years  which could lead to over capacity in the market and resulting decreases in costs of finished wafers 
if the wafers produced by usc cannot be produced at competitive prices  usc could sustain operating losses 
there can be no assurance that these operating losses will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we rely on third parties to assemble and test our products our products are assembled and tested by a variety of independent subcontractors 
our reliance on independent assembly and testing houses to provide these services involves a number of risks  including the absence of adequate availability of certain packaging technologies  the absence of guaranteed capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
commitments we have made to obtain manufacturing capacity could expose us to significant financial risks and give rise to future capital needs in order to obtain an adequate supply of wafers  especially wafers manufactured using advanced process technologies  we have entered into and may consider in the future various transactions  including the use of take or pay contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods  equity investments in or advances or issuances of equity securities to wafer manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct foundries or to develop certain products 
any such transactions would involve financial risk to us and could require us to commit substantial capital or provide technology licenses in return for guaranteed production capacity 
in particular  we have entered into a take or pay contract with tsmc and have entered into the usc joint venture 
the need to commit substantial capital may require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
although we currently believe that the need for such additional capital will be minimal for the next two years  if such capital is needed  the sale or issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing  if required  will be available when needed or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and business manufacturing and design methodology 
our sales are concentrated within a limited number of customers we expect a significant portion of our future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
this concentration is reflected in our accounts receivable where greater than of the balance is represented by three customers at december  three customers  synnex technology  inc synnex  ibm corporation and promate electronic co 
promate  accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales in three customers  synnex  cnw international limited cnw  and compaq computer corporation  accounted for  and  respectively  of net sales in two customers  diamond multimedia systems  inc and synnex  accounted for and  respectively  of net sales in synnex  promate and cnw are distributors 
we expect a significant portion of our future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our strategic customers or that these customers will not otherwise cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event of canceled orders  that such orders will be replaced by other sales 
our sales may be hurt by shortages of components and product defects pc graphics and multimedia subsystems include  in addition to our products  a number of other components that are supplied by third party manufacturers 
any shortage of such components in the future could negatively impact our business and operating results 
furthermore  it is possible that our products may be found to be defective after we have already shipped significant volumes 
if that were to occur  there can be no assurance that we would be able to correct such defects successfully or that such corrections would be acceptable to our customers 
the occurrence of such an event could have a materially negative effect on our business and operating results 
we depend on sales through distributors a substantial percentage of our products are distributed in the distribution channel through add in card manufacturers that in turn sell to value added resellers vars  system integrators si  original equipment manufacturers oem and distributors 
accordingly  we are dependent upon these add in card manufacturers to assist in promoting market acceptance of our products 
the board manufacturers that purchase our products are generally not committed to make future purchases of our products and therefore could discontinue incorporating our products into their graphics boards in favor of a competitor s product  or for any other reason 
in addition  our distributors are given limited rights to return to us the products purchased by them  and we provide our distributors with price protection in the event that we reduce the price of our products 
nearly all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders nearly all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
as a result  we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers 
any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
in addition  cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in us holding excess inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information our ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information 
we have filed several united states and foreign patent applications and to date have a number of issued united states patents 
we rely primarily on our trade secrets and technological know how in the conduct of our business 
the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property might not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
also  our competitors might independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the semiconductor and software industries are characterized by frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we are party to various claims of this nature 
although the ultimate outcome of these matters is not presently determinable  our management presently believes that the resolution of all such pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert additional claims or initiate litigation against us  our foundries or our customers with respect to existing or future products 
in addition  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of others 
litigation by or against us has in the past resulted in  and could in the future result in  substantial expense to us and diversion of the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not litigation is determined in favor of us 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use  sale  offer for sale and importation of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop or obtain non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the technology which is the subject of the litigation 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that any such licenses  if available  would be available on commercially reasonable terms  and any such development or acquisition could require expenditures by us of substantial time and other resources 
any such litigation or unfavorable outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
for example  in october  brooktree alleged that certain of our products infringed a brooktree patent 
the resulting lawsuit resulted in substantial expense to us to defend the action and diverted the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in a settlement of that suit  we agreed to pay to brooktree a license fee and royalties relating to certain product revenues over a five year period 
we must attract  integrate  train and retain key personnel knowledgeable about our business our future success depends in part on the continued service of certain key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software developers  and our ability to identify and hire additional personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the technology sectors and in the regions where our facilities are located 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain existing personnel or attract  hire or retain additional qualified personnel 
the loss of services of any of our senior management team or other key employees or our failure to attract  integrate  train and retain additional key employees could harm our business 
we have recently undergone a management transition in november  we appointed kenneth f 
potashner as president and chief executive officer 
our board of directors also increased the size of the board by one  elected mr 
potashner to fill the newly created vacancy and elected mr 
potashner chairman of the board 
terry n 
holdt  who returned from his retirement in january to assume the role of interim president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  remains as vice chairman of our board of directors 
there can be no assurance as to the effects of this management transition on our business and operating results 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we do not maintain key man insurance on any of our employees 
we have significant exposure to international markets export sales accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively  and we expect that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurance that export sales  as a percentage of net sales  will remain at current levels 
in addition  a substantial proportion of our products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
as a result  we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuations in the us dollar  which could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets or increase the cost of wafers purchased by us  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  potentially longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse tax treatment  and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws 
we have experienced an adverse impact associated with the economic downturn in asia which contributed to our decrease in net sales in in addition  our international operations are subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
our foundries  tsmc and usc  are located in taiwan 
the people s republic of china and taiwan at times experienced strained relations in and  and a worsening of relations or the development of hostilities between the two parties could have a material adverse effect on us 
finally  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we have a significant level of debt as a result of the sale by us of  aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in september  our ratio of long term debt to total capitalization increased from approximately at june  to approximately at december  at december   this ratio increased to 
the increase in this ratio is the result of the decrease in the company s total capitalization as the result of its net loss for the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
our increased leverage could also adversely affect our liquidity  as a substantial portion of available cash from operations may have to be applied to meet debt service requirements 
in the event of a cash shortfall  we could be forced to reduce other expenditures to be able to meet such debt service requirements

our stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock  like that of the common stock of many other semiconductor companies  has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
this volatility may result from general market conditions and market conditions affecting technology and semiconductor stocks generally  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of design wins  technological innovations  acquisitions  investments or business alliances  and the commencement of  developments in or outcome of litigation 
the market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors  especially if our operating results do not meet those expectations 
reports and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views 
the fact that we have in the past met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations does not necessarily mean that we will do so in the future 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
such litigation was brought against the company in and the company is currently involved in another such proceeding 
see item legal proceedings 
we are party to legal proceedings alleging securities violations that could have a negative financial impact on us since november  a number of complaints have been filed in federal and state courts seeking an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of an alleged class of persons who purchased shares of our common stock at various times between april  and november  the complaints name us as defendants as well as certain of our officers and former officers and certain of our directors  asserting that we and they violated federal and state securities laws by misrepresenting and failing to disclose certain information about our business 
in addition  certain shareholders have filed derivative actions in the state courts of california and delaware seeking recovery on our behalf  alleging  among other things  breach of fiduciary duties by such individual defendants 
discovery is currently proceeding 
while our management intends to defend the actions against us vigorously  there can be no assurance that an adverse result or settlement with regards to these lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have also received from the united states securities and exchange commission sec a request for information relating to our financial restatement announcement in november we have responded and intend to continue to respond to the sec requests

impact of foreign currency rate changes the company invoices its customers in us dollars for all products 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
the foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounts in the local currency of the foreign location in order to centralize the foreign exchange risk with the parent company 
to date this risk has not been material 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company s financial statements for the years ended december  and was not material 
since foreign currency exposure increases as intercompany receivables grow  the company is using foreign exchange forward contracts as a means for hedging these balances 
in general  these foreign exchange forward contracts mature in three months 
as of december   the company held the following forward exchange contracts which mature within three months notional fair value in thousands foreign currency forward exchange contracts  singapore dollars
