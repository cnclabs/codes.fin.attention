item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements  including the related notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
capitalized terms used in the following discussion without separate definitions have the respective meanings given to them in note of the notes to the company s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the annual report 
except where specifically noted  the discussion of financial condition and results of operations that appears below covers only the company s continuing operations 
for additional information about the results of discontinued operations  see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
introduction operating organization during fiscal  the company was organized into three operating divisions the north american office products group  which included office supplies  office furniture  and breakroom products and services office coffee  beverage  and vending services naopg  mail boxes etc 
mbe  and the company s international operations in new zealand and australia owned principally through blue star group limited blue star 
the company also holds a equity interest in dudley stationery limited dudley  a uk contract stationer 
the naopg operates primarily in the united states  it also includes two coffee and beverage businesses located in canada 
at the start of fiscal  the company made changes to its organizational structure 
these changes are described in business company overview 
operating revenues and expenses the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of a wide variety of office supplies and other office products  office furniture  office coffee service and related products  and vending products and services to corporate customers 
mbe derives revenues primarily from royalties and marketing fees  franchise fees and the sale of supplies and equipment to mbe locations 
cost of revenues represents the purchase price for a wide variety of office supplies and other office products  office furniture  office coffee services and related products  and vending products and services and includes occupancy  delivery and certain depreciation costs 
rebates and discounts on inventory reduce these costs when such inventory is sold 
mbe s cost of revenues represents primarily franchise operation expenses and the cost of supplies and equipment sold to mbe locations 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent product marketing and selling costs  customer service and product design costs  warehouse costs  and other administrative expenses 
factors affecting comparability the company s financial condition and results of operations have changed dramatically in fiscal as compared to fiscal and earlier years 
the results of operations in fiscal were affected by the company s strategic restructuring plan and financing transactions  which were completed in june  the company s shift away from acquisitions  operating restructuring costs and accelerated change activities 
results in fiscal were affected by acquisition activity during and before that year 
results were affected in both years by fluctuating exchange rates 
strategic restructuring plan and financing transactions in june  the company completed the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions 
the strategic restructuring plan and financing transactions included the spin off to the company s stockholders of four of the company s divisions  the repurchase in a self tender of approximately million of the company s common stock including shares underlying stock options  borrowings under a new bank debt facility and the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes  which increased debt to a total of approximately billion  and an equity investment by a fund managed by clayton  dubilier rice  inc cd r of approximately million 
for a complete description of the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions  see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
as a result of the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions  the company s reported results reflect substantially higher interest expense and substantially different effective income tax rates than in prior periods 
consistent with the company s announced expectations at the time it adopted the strategic restructuring plan  the increased interest expense significantly reduced the company s reported earnings in fiscal  as compared to prior periods 
see consolidated results of operations 
rather than net income and net income per share  management believes that a more meaningful indication of the company s performance is cash flows from operations and earnings from continuing operations before interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense  strategic restructuring plan costs  operating restructuring costs  impaired asset write offs  non recurring acquisition costs  loss on sale and closure of businesses  other income expense and extraordinary items ebitda 
for information regarding ebitda  see selected financial data 
acquisitions from its inception in through the end of the calendar year  the company grew primarily through acquisitions 
the company completed business combinations related to continuing operations and related to discontinued operations from its inception through the end of fiscal the company accounted for of these acquisitions under the pooling of interests method related to continuing operations and related to discontinued operations 
the company accounted for all business combinations completed during fiscal under the purchase method 
the company completed business combinations during fiscal  all of which were accounted for under the purchase method 
consistent with the company s announced expectations  acquisitions have involved smaller businesses and have accounted for a much smaller percentage of the company s revenue growth than in the past 
in november  the company indicated that it intended to reduce future acquisitions even further than originally expected  in order to devote substantially all of its management attention and capital resources to the operation of its existing businesses 
the company did not complete any acquisitions after november the company s consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method during fiscal they also include the results of companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method from their respective acquisition dates 
as previously announced  the company s strategy is to focus on operational improvements and significantly reduce its acquisition activity 
the company expects that the impact of acquisitions on its future results will decrease because the number and size of companies that it acquires are likely to be much smaller  and the company s existing operations are much larger  than in prior years 
effects of fluctuating exchange rates the company derives approximately one third of its revenues from operations in new zealand and australia 
consequently  the company s results of operations  cash flows  and financial position will continue to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the exchange rates for the new zealand and australian dollars  as compared to the us dollar  have declined significantly since the beginning of fiscal see liquidity and capital resources and factors affecting the company s business declines in foreign currencies 
as a result  the us dollar value of revenues from operations in new zealand and australia have declined 
operating restructuring charges consistent with the objectives of the strategic restructuring plan and as part of the company s increased focus on operational matters  the company instituted cost reduction measures following completion of the strategic restructuring plan 
these measures included reductions in headcount  the elimination of duplicative facilities  the consolidation of certain operating functions  and the elimination of multiple information systems to move the company to common information systems 
in implementing these cost reduction measures  the company has incurred  and in the future expects to incur  certain operating restructuring costs 
the company recorded operating restructuring charges of million in fiscal  reflecting the costs of these measures actually being implemented 
approximately million of these charges reflected non cash items 
a majority of these charges reflected severance costs relating to employees who were notified that their positions were being eliminated 
the remainder of the charges reflected costs associated with facility consolidations and asset write downs including elimination of certain information systems 
accelerated change activities during the second half of fiscal  the company organized a series of accelerated change teams acts to realize many of its cost reduction and revenue enhancement strategies on an accelerated basis 
acts are teams of employees in some cases assisted by outside consultants dedicated to driving fundamental business process changes throughout the company s business units 
the acts are organized functional experts focused by initiative  enabling the business unit managers to focus on sales  customer service  and overall productivity issues 
core act initiatives focus on the company s supply chain  including the consolidation of facilities and support functions and the implementation of enhanced pricing strategies and inventory management tools 
the company also formed an act focused solely on reducing working capital to improve overall asset utilization 
the acts began to implement many of their programs toward the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  and they expect to make substantial progress during fiscal the company expects to begin to see the benefits of these initiatives during the second half of fiscal  although there can be no assurance that these strategies will be successful or will have a positive effect within the anticipated timeframe 
see factors affecting the company s business uncertainty of new business strategy 
as previously highlighted in the disclosures made at the end of the third fiscal quarter  the expenses associated with the company s accelerated change programs had a significant negative effect on its results in the fourth quarter of fiscal these expenses consisted primarily of additional sg a expense related to outside resources to refine the company s financial and operating change management strategies  inventory and receivable related charges including those discussed below  and impaired asset write offs related to under performing businesses in north america and australia  as discussed in note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management expects expenses to remain elevated during the first half of fiscal as it continues to implement accelerated change programs 
see results of operations 
the company s operational changes have included consolidation of warehouse and distribution facilities  and the company plans to complete significant additional consolidations in the near future 
in a number of consolidations that the company completed later in fiscal  it found that inventory losses realized in the consolidation process were greater than reserves previously established to cover slow moving and obsolete inventory 
as a result of this experience  and in connection with the company s accelerated change initiatives  the company developed new methodologies to calculate the estimated reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory in naopg  which resulted in the recognition of additional inventory reserves of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the company s operational changes and accelerated change initiatives  the company also determined that uniform accounts receivable reserve guidelines were appropriate for its operating units 
implementation of the new guidelines resulted in the recording of an additional allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
the company is in the early stages of developing these initiatives  and there is no assurance that they will be successful 
in addition  the company expects that over the near term these initiatives will continue to produce short term costs that will offset  all or a part of  expected reductions in overall expense levels 
accelerated implementation of the changes may also result in additional charges including severance costs  facility closure costs  and write downs or write offs of goodwill and other assets 
see liquidity and capital resources and factors affecting the company s business 
because the company is seeking to effect change at an accelerated pace  it may recognize certain non recurring charges more rapidly than would be likely in the absence of the accelerated change initiatives 
for example  because of the rapid changes the company is seeking to effect  it may write down or write off assets that it previously had expected to use in continuing operations 
in some cases  charges may relate to businesses that the company had expected to continue to operate or to operate on a temporary basis  pending disposition  but decides instead to close 
the company also expects to make investments that are expected to drive change on an accelerated basis  and this is likely to cause expenses to increase in the near term

revenues for fiscal include revenues from companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method after the beginning of fiscal the purchased companies 
revenues from such companies were included in revenues for a portion of fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decline in international revenues as a result of the devaluation of the new zealand and australian dollars against the us dollar the usd 
because revenues generated in new zealand and australia contributed approximately one third of the company s consolidated revenues during this period  management estimates that currency devaluation had the effect of reducing the company s increase in reported consolidated revenues in us dollar terms by approximately 
on a pro forma basis  giving effect to the strategic restructuring plan  and the purchase acquisitions and business closures and divestitures completed after the beginning of fiscal  as if such transactions were completed as of the beginning of fiscal  and assuming that the average exchange rates for the new zealand and australian dollars in fiscal were equal to the average exchange rates in fiscal  revenues increased 
naopg revenues naopg revenues increased from billion or of consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended april   to billion or of consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended april  this increase was primarily due to the completion of acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal on a pro forma basis  assuming all acquisitions were completed at the beginning of fiscal  naopg revenues in fiscal increased only 
this slight increase was primarily due to the impact of losing a number of larger local and regional accounts to competitors  often when the headquarters office of a customer s business consolidated its office supply purchasing activities and awarded a contract to a single supplier other than the company 
in addition  the company had weak sales volume in a number of underperforming local business units particularly within the contract furniture operations 
these businesses are now being managed aggressively through the company s fix  sell or close strategy 
see business business strategies 
although the company has been successful in adding a substantial number of mid sized and smaller accounts  the loss of larger customer business more than offset the increase in business from such mid sized and smaller accounts 
to address the loss of larger customers  the company has instituted a national accounts system that allows it to handle such customers order  pricing  billing and delivery requirements 
the company has also created a national sales team to help support sales initiatives intended to gain large account business 
blue star revenues blue star revenues decreased  from million  or of consolidated revenues  for the fiscal year ended april   to million  or of consolidated revenues  for the fiscal year ended april  this decrease is due primarily to the devaluation of the new zealand and australian dollars against the usd since the beginning of fiscal the following table details the declines in the average exchange rates of the new zealand and australian dollars versus the usd for the fiscal year ended april  and april  average exchange rates for the fiscal year ended april  april  decline new zealand dollar 


australian dollar 


on a pro forma basis  assuming that the average exchange rates for the new zealand and australian dollars in fiscal were equal to the average exchange rates in fiscal  blue star revenues in new zealand and australia  calculated in local currencies  increased for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to the fiscal year ended april  this increase was primarily the result of continuing revenue improvements in the print and retail groups  and moderate revenue growth in the new zealand portion of the business supplies group 
mail boxes etc 
revenues mbe revenues increased  from million  or of consolidated revenues  for the fiscal year ended april   to million  or of consolidated revenues  for the fiscal year ended april  this increase was primarily the result of mbe only being consolidated for five months in fiscal since mbe was acquired in november on a pro forma basis  mbe revenues increased primarily due to the fact that same store sales increased over the last year  offset partially by reduced franchise fees because fewer domestic area franchises were sold 
gross profit consolidated gross profit increased  from million for the fiscal year ended april   to million for the fiscal year ended april  the increase in gross profit is in part related to the increase in revenues 
however  as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased from for the fiscal year ended april   to for the fiscal year ended april  the company believes that the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues reflects disappointing margins at certain under performing units at naopg and blue star 
in addition  as part of the company s working capital initiatives commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as a detailed analysis of all businesses  the company determined it appropriate to record additional provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory in naopg and blue star 
the resulting charges also reduced gross profit 
a number of the company s act initiatives discussed above in introduction are designed to address factors that management believes are adversely affecting gross margins  but there can be no assurances of the timing or magnitude of such improvements  or whether they will be realized at all 
other factors also may affect gross margins 
see factors affecting the company s business 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million for the fiscal year ended april   to million for the fiscal year ended april   due to the increase in revenues and a higher level of corporate costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from for the fiscal year ended april   to for the fiscal year ended april  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was the net result of a number of factors  including i the disposal or closure of several under performing technology businesses in new zealand and australia which operated with low overhead structures  and ii increased corporate expenses  including approximately million of consulting fees in connection with the company s act initiatives 
in addition  the million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts in fiscal discussed above in introduction  increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company has historically utilized grants of employee stock options as a method of incentivizing employees by increasing their ownership interest in the company  which the company believes has the effect of more closely aligning their interests with the interests of stockholders of the company 
for discussion of these stock options  see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
amortization expense amortization expense increased  from million for the fiscal year ended january   to million for the fiscal year ended april  this increase was due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of the purchased companies 
strategic restructuring costs in conjunction with the completion of the strategic restructuring plan  the company incurred non recurring costs from continuing operations of million  million of which were non cash 
an additional million of such costs were incurred by the spin off companies and were included in results of discontinued operations 
the strategic restructuring plan costs related to continuing operations consisted of i compensation expense of million million of which was non cash related to the difference between the exercise prices of employee stock options underlying shares that were accepted in the equity tender and the per share per share prior to the reverse stock split purchase price in the equity tender  ii professional fees including accounting  legal  investment banking  and printing fees of million  and iii a non cash expense of million resulting from the issuance of  incremental shares of common stock with a market value of per share on the date of issuance related to the temporary  effective reduction in the conversion price of the notes from to per share and per share prior to the reverse stock split on million  principal amount  of the notes  which the company made as part of the exchange offer for the notes 
for a description of the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions  see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
operating restructuring costs the company recorded operating restructuring costs of approximately million during the fiscal year ended april  see introduction for a discussion of operating restructuring costs 
impaired asset write offs during the company s evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill  certain operating companies were identified as having future undiscounted cash flow projections less than the carrying value of the unamortized goodwill related to such companies  thus indicating impairment 
as a result  in fiscal an impairment loss of million was recorded as a reduction to goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the future discounted cash flows of the entities 
see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  increased  from million for the fiscal year ended april   to million for the fiscal year ended april  this increase was due primarily to the completion of the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions in june  which resulted in a significant increase in both the amount of debt outstanding and the average interest rate related to such debt 
interest expense in fiscal is expected to be higher than fiscal because both the increased amount of debt outstanding and related higher average interest rate will be in place for the entire fiscal year  versus approximately ten and one half months in fiscal loss on sale and closure of business the company recorded a million pre tax loss on the sale and closure of businesses during the fiscal year ended april  the loss was primarily the result of the sale and closure of under performing technology businesses in new zealand and australia 
other income other income decreased by million from million of income for the fiscal year ended april   to an expense of million for the fiscal year ended april  other expenses include the company s share of the net income or loss of dudley  in which the company has a equity investment  and miscellaneous other income and expense items 
the decrease was due primarily to two factors 
first  dudley reported a net loss in fiscal  of which the company s share was million  compared to net income in fiscal  of which the company s share amounted to million 
the loss reported by dudley in fiscal was primarily due to the impact of a new national distribution facility  which increased operating costs and affected customer service levels in the start up period 
second  in fiscal other income included a marketing fee of million earned in conjunction with providing a license to use a list of the company s customers in the united states 
the company did not earn similar fees in fiscal income taxes the benefit from income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended april   represents an effective income tax benefit rate of 
the effective income tax benefit rate reflects the recording of an income tax benefit at the federal statutory rate of  plus appropriate state  local and foreign taxes 
the effective income tax benefit rate was reduced to reflect non deductible goodwill amortization expense 
the benefit from income taxes gives effect to the net impact of i an income tax benefit of on the results from continuing operations  excluding the strategic restructuring plan costs  operating restructuring costs  impaired asset write offs and loss on sale and closure of businesses  ii an income tax benefit on the operating restructuring costs million  a portion of the strategic restructuring plan costs million and the loss on the sale and closure of businesses million  that are deductible for income tax purposes  and iii the non deductible nature of million of impaired asset write offs and million of strategic restructuring plan costs 
provision for income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended april  represents an effective income tax rate of 
the provision for income taxes reflects the recording of an income tax provision at the federal statutory rate of  plus appropriate state  local and foreign taxes 
the effective tax rate was increased to reflect non deductible goodwill amortization expense 
the effective tax benefit rate in fiscal is not comparable to the effective tax rate in fiscal due to the combined effect of i the pre tax losses in fiscal  ii the increase in non deductible goodwill amortization expense and the incurrence of significant impaired asset write offs in fiscal and iii the incurrence of significant non deductible strategic restructuring plan costs in fiscal discontinued operations discontinued operations contributed million of income for the fiscal year ended april  and a loss of million for the fiscal year ended april  there was no income from discontinued operations included in the company s consolidated financial statements subsequent to the distribution  which was completed on june  see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  consolidated revenues consolidated revenues increased  from billion in fiscal  to billion in fiscal this increase was primarily due to acquisitions 
revenues for fiscal include revenues from companies acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method after the beginning of fiscal the fiscal and purchased companies 
revenues for fiscal include revenues from of the fiscal and purchased companies for a portion of such period 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by the effect on international revenues of the devaluation of the new zealand and australian dollars versus the usd 
because revenues generated in new zealand and australia contributed approximately one third of the company s consolidated revenues in fiscal  management estimates that the currency devaluation had the effect of reducing the company s increase in reported consolidated revenues in usd terms by approximately 
international revenues international revenues increased  from million  or of consolidated revenues in fiscal  to million  or of consolidated revenues in fiscal international revenues consisted primarily of revenues from new zealand and australia  with the balance from canada 
the increase in international revenues was primarily due to the inclusion  in the revenues for fiscal  of revenues from companies that were acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method after the beginning of fiscal  the most significant of which was whitcoulls group limited  which the company s wholly owned subsidiary blue star group limited acquired in july revenues from of such companies were included in international revenues for a portion of fiscal the growth in international revenues was partially reduced by a decline in the exchange rates of the new zealand and australian dollars against the usd 
international revenues in new zealand and australia  calculated in their local currencies  increased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal see liquidity and capital resources and factors affecting the company s business operations outside of the united states 
the following table illustrates the declines in the average exchange rates of the new zealand and australian dollars versus the usd in fiscal and average exchange rates for the fiscal year ended april  april  decline new zealand dollar 


australian dollar 


gross profit gross profit increased  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a shift in revenue mix  primarily as a result of acquisitions  to revenues from traditionally lower margin products and services 
in addition  the company experienced a slight decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal this decrease was partially offset by improved purchasing and rebate programs negotiated with vendors 
the company expects to continue to negotiate favorable purchasing and rebate programs with vendors 
however  the company does not believe that it will be able to continue to improve these programs at the same rates as in the past  as significant progress has already been made with vendors 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  primarily due to the inclusion of the results of the fiscal and purchased companies 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to several factors  including i a shift in revenue mix  primarily as a result of acquisitions  to revenues from products and services traditionally having lower selling  general and administrative expenses  ii reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses by the company through the consolidation of certain redundant facilities and job functions  and iii reductions in the level of many general and administrative expenses incurred by the company through the negotiation of national or other large scale contracts with the providers of certain services affecting these general and administrative expenses 
amortization expense amortization expense increased  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal this increase is due exclusively to the increase in the number of purchase acquisitions  including acquisitions related to continuing operations included in the results for fiscal versus fiscal see factors affecting the company s business intangible assets 
non recurring acquisition costs the company incurred non recurring acquisition costs of approximately million during fiscal  in conjunction with business combinations that were accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
the company did not incur any non recurring acquisition costs in fiscal because all of the company s acquisitions in fiscal were accounted for under the purchase method 
these non recurring acquisition costs included accounting  legal and investment banking fees  real estate and environmental assessments and appraisals  various regulatory fees and recognition of transaction related obligations 
generally accepted accounting principles require the company to expense all acquisition costs both those paid by the company and those paid by the sellers of the acquired companies related to business combinations accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
operating restructuring costs the company incurred restructuring costs of approximately million during fiscal and million during fiscal these costs represent the external costs and liabilities to close redundant company facilities  severance costs related to the company s employees and other costs associated with the company s restructuring plans 
interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  increased from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal this was due primarily to a reduction in interest income during fiscal the company earned interest income on the proceeds from the issuance of an aggregate of million of the notes in may and june of the first quarter of fiscal 
these proceeds were subsequently used to fund a portion of the cash consideration used in business combinations 
interest expense remained relatively consistent  as steadily increasing borrowings and a declining cash position were offset by the repayment of debt from the proceeds of a stock offering in january and declining interest rates 
as a result of the completion of the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions  the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates related to such debt increased significantly  as compared to april  see liquidity and capital resources and factors affecting the company s business high level of debt 
other income other income increased  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal other income for fiscal of million consisted primarily of a million marketing fee  a gain on the sale of an investment and the company s share of the net income from dudley 
the company acquired its interest in dudley in november other income for fiscal of million consisted primarily of a foreign currency gain of million 
income taxes provision for income taxes increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
during both fiscal years  the effective income tax rates reflect the recording of income tax provisions at the federal statutory rate of  plus applicable state and local taxes 
in addition  the effective income tax rates were increased in both periods to reflect the incurrence of non deductible goodwill amortization expense 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal also reflects the incurrence of non deductible  non recurring acquisition costs offset by the effect of several business combinations in such period accounted for under the pooling of interests method  where the acquired companies were not subject to federal income taxes on a corporate level as they had elected to be treated as subchapter s corporations prior to being acquired by the company 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash and working capital at april   the company had cash of million and working capital of million 
the company believes working capital initiatives implemented during the fourth quarter contributed approximately million to the company s improved cash position by reducing accounts receivable and managing inventory levels  offset by an increased level of vendor payments 
the additional investment of million in april by cd r also contributed to the company s improved cash position 
the company s capitalization  defined as the sum of long term debt and stockholders equity  at april   was approximately billion 
long term debt in june  the company completed the strategic restructuring plan 
see note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the company financed the aggregate cost of purchasing shares in the equity tender  repurchasing million of the notes  and repaying its former credit facility with the proceeds of the equity investment  with the net proceeds from the sale and issuance of the notes and borrowings under the new credit facility 
the company also incurred significant transaction including financing costs and expenses 
see consolidated results of operations 
in connection with the completion of the strategic restructuring plan  the company incurred approximately million of additional indebtedness  and the weighted average annual interest rate  including the amortization of debt issue costs  on all outstanding indebtedness increased from approximately prior to completion of the strategic restructuring plan to approximately after completion of the strategic restructuring plan 
upon completion of the strategic restructuring plan  the company terminated and repaid the balance outstanding under its former million credit facility and entered into the new credit facility 
the new credit facility was revised in april the new credit facility  after being revised  provides for an aggregate principal amount of  million  consisting of i a seven year multi draw term loan facility totaling million  ii a seven year revolving credit facility totaling million  iii a seven year term loan facility totaling million  and iv an eight year term loan facility totaling million 
in connection with the completion of the strategic restructuring plan and the financing transactions  the company borrowed the full amount of the two single draw term loan facilities 
interest rates on borrowings bear interest  at the company s option  at the lending bank s base rate plus an applicable margin of up to  or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin of up to 
the company s obligations under the new credit facility are guaranteed by its present domestic subsidiaries  future material domestic subsidiaries will also be required to guarantee these obligations 
the new credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries  future material domestic subsidiaries also will be required to pledge their assets as collateral 
the company was required to enter into arrangements to ensure that the effective interest rate paid by the company on at least of the aggregate amount outstanding under the new credit facility and the notes was at a fixed rate of interest 
as a result  the company has entered into interest rate swap arrangements to limit the libor based interest rate exposure on million of the outstanding balance under the new credit facility to rates ranging from to 
the interest rate swap agreements expire over a period ranging from to as a result of these swap agreements and including the fixed rate notes  the company has fixed the interest rates on million of the total debt outstanding at april  at april   the company had total debt outstanding of approximately  million at a weighted average interest rate  excluding amortization of debt issue costs  of approximately 
in april  the company reached an agreement with its bank lenders to revise the financial covenants and other key terms of its bank credit facility 
in addition to revising the financial covenants  the modifications included a reduction in the amount of the multi draw term loan facility from million to million none of which is currently outstanding 
the revolving credit facility previously had been reduced from million to million 
the company paid amendment fees of million in connection with the modifications to the new credit facility 
there was no change to the interest rate the company pays on borrowings under the bank credit facility 
at april   the company had million outstanding under the new credit facility and had additional borrowing availability of million under the revolving credit facility and of million under the multi term term loan facility 
the new credit facility includes  among others  restrictions on the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  pay dividends  or engage in certain other transactions  and requirements that the company maintain certain financial ratios  and other provisions customary for loans to highly leveraged companies  including representations by the company  conditions to funding  cost and yield protections  restricted payment provisions  amendment provisions and indemnification provisions 
the new credit facility is subject to mandatory prepayment in a variety of circumstances  including upon certain asset sales and financing transactions  and also from excess cash flow as defined in the new credit facility 
the notes are unsecured but are guaranteed by the company s present domestic subsidiaries  future material domestic subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the notes 
the indenture governing the notes places restrictions on the company s ability to incur indebtedness  to make certain payments  investments  loans and guarantees and to sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of its assets to  or merge or consolidate with  another entity 
the eight year term loan facility contains negative covenants and default provisions substantially similar to those contained in the indenture governing the notes 
stockholders equity in april  a fund managed by cd r  the company s largest shareholder  made an investment of an additional million  net of fees of million 
in exchange for the equity contribution  the cd r led fund received a new class of non voting preferred stock that is convertible into million shares of the company s common stock 
the preferred stock converts into common stock upon transfer to anyone other than cd r or its affiliates 
the preferred stock carries no voting rights  but where stockholder approval is required for a merger  consolidation  or sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets  the preferred stock will vote together with the common stock 
the preferred stock carries no dividend right other than the right to receive the same level of dividends as the common stock  and it has a nominal liquidation preference 
as part of the new investment  the company amended warrants that the cd r led fund acquired as a part of its original investment in the company in june to reduce the exercise price to per share 
the warrants cover approximately million shares of common stock of the company and are exerciseable at any time after june  until june  the company intends to use the proceeds for debt repayment  funding future growth initiatives and general corporate purposes  including accelerated change initiatives to achieve rapid improvements in key operating areas 
foreign currency during fiscal  there was a net reduction in stockholders equity  through a cumulative translation adjustment of approximately million  reflecting primarily the impact of the declining exchange rate on the company s investments in its new zealand subsidiaries 
in addition  the devaluation throughout the year has adversely affected the return on the company s investment in its new zealand and australian operations 
the company cannot predict whether exchange rates will increase or decline in the future 
if the exchange rates were to decline further  the company s return on assets and equity from its new zealand and australian operations would be further depressed 
during fiscal  the company considered its intercompany loans to blue star to be a long term investment 
as a result of the strategic review of operations conducted during the fourth quarter of the fiscal  the company changed its perspective on blue star operations and no longer considers the intercompany loans to be long term in nature 
accordingly  effective april   the company will record the currency transaction gain loss related to its intercompany loans with blue star as a component of income from continuing operations

year compliance the company is carrying out a process to assess year compliance of its systems and the systems of major vendors and third party service providers  and to remediate any non compliance of its systems 
prior to the year readiness project  the company initiated a common system project for hardware and software systems 
as a result of this project  the company has replaced several systems 
the company has not materially accelerated the replacement of hardware or software systems as a result of year performance and or compliance issues 
as described below  each usop group naopg  mbe  blue star group and dudley is performing its own year readiness review 
naopg naopg s year compliance process involves three phases  as described below 
phase one inventory and planning the company completed this phase in may in this phase  the company inventoried all hardware and software that potentially is susceptible to year problems  prepared plans for assessing compliance and for completing remediation  and prepared vendor and supplier compliance surveys 
phase two assessment in this phase  the company assessed which of its systems are year compliant  obtained compliance statements from hardware and software vendors  supply manufacturers and service trading partners  and planned for remediation of non compliant systems 
the company completed this phase in december the company s assessment plan included assessment of year compliance of non information technology non it components  including the company s bindery machinery  coffee roasting facilities  office furniture manufacturing facilities  security systems  credit card processing devices and freight elevators 
the company believes there are no significant uses of micro processing oriented equipment within its manufacturing systems and completed assessment of these systems in december phase three remediation and testing in this phase  the company is deploying plans for elimination  upgrade  replacement or modification of non compliant systems  and testing compliance 
the company originally scheduled completion of this phase for the summer of and has extended the completion date to october verification and testing will continue through december the company s trinity system  which is the core information management and processing system for its north american office supplies operations  is year compliant 
the company is installing this system throughout its office supplies operations  and it expects to complete its trinity installation plans for office supplies businesses by the end of some naopg locations including those in the furniture  vending  and office coffee businesses will continue to use operating systems other than trinity after the end of therefore  the company is assessing the compliance of other systems used by its naopg operating subsidiaries 
the company has determined that some of the systems used by its naopg subsidiaries are not currently year compliant  but the company believes that it is highly likely that these systems will be made compliant without material expense by the fall of the company has received compliance statements from approximately of its primary supply vendors 
based on these statements  the company believes that most supply vendors who have responded will be year compliant by the end of september the company has identified some vendors as fitting a concerned profile due to late compliance dates or because responses indicate some possibility of poor planning 
the company is communicating with each of these vendors to remediate these concerns 
failure of these vendors to reach year compliance or remediate prior to the century change is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s performance 
with regard to products  the company cannot warrant year compliance for products sold and distributed by the company and its subsidiaries 
product is procured from vendors and manufacturers for sale and distribution to our customers 
the company does not believe it would face material liability from non compliance with respect to these products 
if the company fails to achieve year compliance in all its systems  the company could lose the ability to process certain of its customer s orders until compliance is achieved or a means to work around the failure is implemented 
the company s systems are not now uniform across all operations and the company does not expect uniformity by the end of therefore  any failure would not be system wide 
the company believes that in a worst case scenario  at most of its orders would be affected 
a failure to fill orders would not however  necessarily result in a complete loss of the order 
an order could be filled through alternative methods within a relatively short period 
nevertheless  any disruption in order fulfillment could result in some loss of revenue 
if this disruption is the result of noncompliance that is greater than anticipated  the loss of revenue could be material 
the company is in the process of establishing contingency plans and anticipates completion by october with respect to naopg  the company s assessment and remediation of year compliance issues has a budget of less than million  and expenses have been less than expected 
the company does not currently expect that future expenses for assessment or remediation will be material 
mbe  blue star group and dudley the company has received reports from mbe that address the year readiness of software and hardware provided by mbe and used by mbe franchisees  as well as that used by mbe s corporate operations 
mbe is in the process of assessing and testing mission critical systems  and performing additional activities as summarized below 
these efforts fall within three categories 
first  mbe continues to review year compliance as it relates to the software that mbe writes and provides to its franchisees 
second  mbe continues to review year compliance as it relates to its internal hardware and software that it uses for the daily operations of its corporate business 
third  mbe continues to review year compliance statements of major vendors of mbe and its franchisees  including statements of vendors that supply hardware to mbe that mbe re sells to its franchisees 
mbe creates proprietary software mbe software for its franchisees that are used for a variety of functions to operate an mbe center 
based on mbe s testing  the majority of this software is currently year compliant 
for the remaining mbe software  mbe plans either i to reprogram or otherwise upgrade such software  or ii to no longer support  and no longer require franchisees to purchase and use  such software 
mbe expects any reprogramming to be completed by september mbe does not believe that a failure to complete these upgrades would have a material adverse effect on its franchisees or mbe s results of operations 
mbe s franchisees may also use other software  not provided or recommended by mbe  and this software and or its combinations with mbe software may not be year compliant 
the franchisees are responsible for ensuring that software not provided by mbe is year compliant both standing alone and in combination with mbe software 
mbe does not believe that the failure of franchisees to obtain year compliance would have a material adverse effect on mbe because franchisees have manual alternatives available 
mbe s franchisees purchase or lease some hardware from mbe  which is provided to mbe by various manufacturers 
mbe has reviewed statements from the vendors of hardware currently being sold or leased to franchisees by mbe  and such statements indicate that such hardware is year compliant 
with respect to software and hardware used by mbe s corporate operations  mbe has reported to the company that some software products used by mbe for certain accounting and database functions  as well as some desktop computers  are not currently year compliant 
mbe and the providers of this software and hardware are in the process of reprogramming such software and upgrading such hardware and expect to complete this process by september mbe expects to be able to bring its software and hardware that are not currently year compliant into compliance within budgeted limits and without material expense 
mbe does not believe any failure to reprogram or upgrade the software and hardware used by mbe in its corporate operations would have a material adverse effect on mbe 
much of mbe s hardware and software depends upon the proper interaction of various hardware  software and services furnished by third parties 
while mbe is performing year readiness tests on its systems and attempting to obtain statements from its primary vendors  the vast array of combinations of mbe and third party components including those provided by franchisees  functions and entry and exit points make it impractical to test every aspect of the systems 
mbe is currently evaluating statements from its mission critical vendors to develop contingency plans in the event one or more of such vendors experiences a failure due to year non readiness 
mbe currently expects to complete such contingency plans by september however  any such contingency plans to be developed by mbe will be limited by the fact that there are only a small number of vendors providing shipping and delivery services on a national and worldwide scale  accordingly  alternative means of delivery will be limited in the event one or more of mbe s major vendors experiences a failure due to year non compliance 
blue star s review of compliance is ongoing 
based on reports received to date by the company from blue star  the majority of systems used in new zealand and australia are currently year compliant  and the company expects that the majority of non compliant systems will be year compliant by september  blue star is continuing to survey its major vendors to determine such vendor s year readiness 
some vendors have failed to reply  but key vendors have been identified and blue star has obtained assurances  which it believes are reliable  from these vendors where potential exposure was deemed critical 
based on reports received to date by the company from dudley  an initial assessment of the systems indicates that there are no significant year issues 
the company s review of year compliance issues at mbe  blue star and dudley to date has been based on reports received from those operations  and no on site review or testing has been conducted to date by company personnel 
these operations also have not segregated their expenses for year compliance from other information technology costs  but the company does not expect these expenses to exceed million 
the company s level of assurance regarding the compliance of systems of mbe  blue star and dudley is lower than if it had conducted on site testing 
the company plans to schedule an on site review of blue star by company personnel in the second quarter of fiscal august october  to improve its level of assurance regarding these systems 
mbe  blue star and the company s interest in dudley represent approximately one third of the company s consolidated revenues 
if the operations of any of these groups is not materially compliant within a safe time frame  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the company s business is subject to seasonal influences 
the company s historical revenues and profitability in its core office products business have typically been lower in the first two quarters of its fiscal year  primarily due to the lower level of business activity in north america during the summer months 
the revenues and profitability of the company s operations in new zealand and australia and at mbe have generally been higher in the company s third quarter 
quarterly results also may be affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions and dispositions  the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions and dispositions  variations in the prices paid by the company for the products it sells  the mix of products sold  and general economic conditions 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that the company may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial data for the fiscal years ended april  and april  in thousands  except per share amounts 
the information has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that in the opinion of management reflect all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  necessary for a fair presentation of such quarterly information 
fiscal quarters first second third fourth total revenues      gross profit      operating income loss      loss from continuing operations before extraordinary items      loss from discontinued operations   extraordinary items net loss      per share amounts basic and diluted loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations extraordinary items net loss fiscal quarters first second third fourth total revenues      gross profit      operating income      income from continuing operations      income loss from discontinued operations      net income      per share amounts basic income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income diluted income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations during fiscal  or new accounting pronouncements in fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income loss and its components 
comprehensive income loss consists of net income loss and foreign currency translation adjustments as presented in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on total stockholders equity or net income loss 
in fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  which supersedes sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the company to report segment information based on the management  or operating segment  approach rather than the industry segment approach required under sfas no 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosures about the company s products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company  but did affect the disclosure of segment information 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  fiscal for the company 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
management of the company anticipates that  due to its limited use of derivative instruments  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  fiscal for the company 
sop provides guidance for accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
management of the company anticipates that the adoption of sop will not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
factors affecting the company s business a number of factors  including those discussed below  may affect the company s future operating results 
uncertainty of new business strategy implementation of our new strategy may disrupt our operations and may fail to increase earnings 
we are currently implementing a new business strategy that will require us to incur significant costs in the short term 
we cannot be sure that this new strategy will be successful 
from our inception in through the end of  we grew primarily through acquisitions 
our new strategy  which we describe in greater detail in business business strategies  involves integrating the operations we have acquired  reducing costs and increasing sales 
the short term costs of implementing this strategy include costs for outside consultants to help us implement the strategy more quickly  costs of fixing  selling or closing ineffective operations and costs of upgrading our technology and distribution systems 
we discuss these costs in greater detail in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction 
in addition  some of our management will sometimes be focused on implementing the new business strategy rather than normal day to day operations during the implementation of these changes  which could cause our business to suffer 
we expect that the increased costs discussed above will reduce our profitability at least through october if we are unable to implement our new strategy effectively  our business may suffer for a longer period of time 
high level of debt our high level of debt limits our ability to get additional debt financing and may restrict our operations in other ways 
we have a high level of debt compared to our stockholders equity and compared to some of our major competitors 
this high level of debt may restrict our business operations in the following ways lenders may not be willing to lend additional amounts to us for future working capital needs  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  or may only be willing to lend these amounts to us at relatively unfavorable terms 
we will have to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay interest expense on our debt rather than to fund our operations 
if our cash flow is lower than we expect  we may not have enough cash left after we pay interest costs to fully implement our new business strategy  or to implement it as quickly as we would like 
if our cash flow is insufficient to pay interest expense on our debt  we may be forced to refinance our debt  modify our operations or sell portions of our business to meet our debt obligations 
we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns than those of our competitors that have less debt  reducing our ability to compete effectively 
as of april   we are able to incur million in additional debt under our new credit facility 
if our operating results decline  however  this available amount may be reduced 
additional borrowings would increase the above risks 
interest rate increases increases in interest rates will increase the cost of paying interest on our debt 
of our debt  million or is subject to interest rates that vary based on changes in prevailing interest rates 
if interest rates rise  the cost of paying interest on this portion of our debt will increase 
increased interest rates on our debt may restrict our business operations further  in the ways described above 
challenges of combining acquired businesses we may fail to effectively combine operations of the businesses we have acquired 
we are continuing to integrate businesses we have acquired 
for this process to be successful  we need to effectively combine and manage the businesses we have acquired  including their employees  facilities and distribution systems  in such a way that we reduce costs and increase revenue 
in the short term  this process is expensive and complex  and involves significant risks  including the integration process may distract and overburden our management 
unanticipated liabilities or contingencies of acquired companies may arise and consume resources unexpectedly 
the combination of the acquired business financial  personnel  computer and other systems will be expensive and unpredictable  and costly complications may arise 
our controls and information systems may not be adequate to manage a fully integrated business 
we may lose employees who cannot adapt to the changes required by the integration process 
as a result of the above risks  our sales or customer service may suffer 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate these new businesses effectively or as quickly as we expect 
declines in foreign currencies declines in the value of new zealand and australian dollars would reduce our reported revenue and earnings 
we derive approximately one third of our revenues from our operations in new zealand and australia 
as a result  declines in the value of the currencies of these countries  relative to the value of the us dollar  would reduce our reported revenues 
during and  the value of these currencies declined substantially as compared to the us dollar 
due primarily to this devaluation  our reported revenues from new zealand and australia for fiscal year declined as compared to fiscal year by 
if these currencies continue to fall relative to the us dollar  our reported revenues from these operations would continue to fall and would fail to reflect our operational success 
we cannot be sure whether and to what extent these declines will continue 
also  we are obligated to repay substantially all of our indebtedness in us dollars 
as a result  declines in these currency exchange rates may make it more difficult for us to repay our debt 
beginning with fiscal year  we are revising the way we account for adjustments to our intercompany loans with blue star that arise from changes in the value of foreign currencies 
we describe this in detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
under our prior policy  adjustments were not reflected in earnings 
however  in the future  adjustments will be reflected in earnings in the fiscal quarter the currency value changes 
if currency exchange rates decline  this new policy will reduce our earnings 
ability to compete some of our national competitors have more resources than we have to capture market share 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and this competition has been increasing 
overall  we compete with a large number of smaller  independent companies  many of which are well established in their local markets 
in the united states  we also compete with five large  national office products companies who operate in many of our geographic and product markets 
some of these large  national companies also compete with us in new zealand and australia 
we are facing increasing competition from our national competitors 
some of our national competitors have more resources than we do to compete for customers 
some of these competitors have begun to compete more aggressively for businesses that have to employees 
our national competitors had not previously focused on that market  and we may lose customers in that market to national competitors 
we also face increasing competitive pressures from our customers  particularly those with larger accounts 
these customers are demanding more competitive bids 
some of our national competitors may be better able to respond to these more intense customer demands and we may lose or fail to attract large account customers due to these competitive pressures 
also  because it is becoming more common for larger companies to require their smaller offices to purchase supplies from a single supplier designated by their corporate headquarters  we may also lose customers that are smaller offices of large accounts we do not serve 
during the past year  we have lost customers in this way  and this may continue 
competition on the internet we may lose market share to competitors who sell products on the internet sooner or more effectively than we do 
the increasing use of the internet for commercial transactions may further increase and intensify the competition we face 
many of our competitors  particularly our large  national competitors  are pursuing new and alternative sales methods  such as direct mail and internet sales 
many of these efforts are specifically targeted at middle market businesses  which have been one of us office products primary market focuses 
competitors who sell products on the internet most effectively may gain a competitive advantage because they may provide added convenience to customers and may reduce their costs of doing business 
also  since the internet may require lower start up costs than traditional businesses  new competitors may more quickly and easily establish themselves 
we may not be able to fully implement our internet sales effort as effectively as our competitors 
our competitors may have more resources to devote to development of their internet business and may have a better ability to  among other things produce or buy advertising  maintain an effective web site  provide quality customer service and telephone support related to their internet sales  and hire effective technical staff 
our high level of debt and dedication of resources to our new business strategy may hinder our ability to devote additional resources to internet sales compared to our competitors  particularly in the short term 
ability to sell businesses we may not be able to get reasonable terms for businesses we want to sell 
as part of our new strategy  we have identified a number of operations that we want to sell 
our decisions to sell these operations involve risks  including the following we may not be able to sell these businesses as quickly as we would like 
we may not be able to find suitable purchasers for these businesses or get terms for the sales that are favorable to us 
as a result  we may incur losses as a result of these sales 
the performance of each business we wish to sell may suffer if the sale process disrupts the business  or if employees choose to leave when they hear of the potential sale of the operation 
sales at the businesses may decline if customers stop buying from us as a result of the potential sale of the business or a decline in performance 
influence of clayton  dubilier rice the group affiliated with clayton  dubilier rice that holds a large block of our stock has significant power to affect our management 
because clayton  dubilier rice s interests may not always be the same as those of our other security holders  this may lead to company decisions that are not satisfactory to these other security holders 
our major stockholder is an investment fund that is affiliated with clayton  dubilier rice 
as our major stockholder  this fund and clayton  dubilier rice have significant power to affect our business 
this may result in outcomes that are not satisfactory to our other security holders because the interests of clayton  dubilier rice may not always be the same as those other security holders 
clayton  dubilier rice has significant power to affect our stockholder votes 
pursuant to the strategic restructuring plan and a separate investment completed in april of this year  the investment fund owns of our outstanding common stock  owns preferred stock that has votes representing of all votes in circumstances we describe below  and owns rights to buy additional shares of our common stock that could increase its ownership to as high as of our stock in the future if the preferred stock is converted to common stock 
the preferred shares owned by the fund are generally non voting but do have voting rights in the following instances approval of a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  approval of any proposed changes to our corporate documents that adversely affect the preferred shares  and approval of a reorganization  dissolution  winding up  liquidation or similar action of our company 
the investment fund also has significant representation on our board of directors  as explained below 
this representation may allow clayton  dubilier rice s interests to take a more prominent role in board decisions 
as stated above  these interests  however  may not always be the same as the interests of our smaller investors 
the investment fund has the right to nominate three of the eight potential members of our board of directors  including the chairman of our board 
three of these eight directors were nominees of the investment fund 
in addition  some board decisions  including those listed below  require the approval of three fourths of the board 
this requirement means that  for any of these decisions to be approved  at least one of the directors nominated by the fund must concur 
these decisions include decisions regarding sales of our equity securities  unless the sales are made under employee benefit plans  in acquisitions or in public offerings  and then only if the sales do not exceed limits set out in our agreement with the investment fund  any merger  tender offer for our securities or sale  lease or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or other business combinations of our company  unless the consideration for the sale is all cash or is freely tradable common stock of a large public company  any dissolution or partial liquidation of our company  and any change to our charter or by laws that is inconsistent with the fund s rights under agreements it has entered into with us as part of the strategic restructuring plan 
challenges of ongoing litigation our need to defend ongoing lawsuits may distract us  and the defense of these lawsuits may be expensive 
we are currently defending several lawsuits related to events surrounding the strategic restructuring plan 
these lawsuits are further described in item legal proceedings 
we may be required to devote significant company resources to the defense of these lawsuits  including employee time for depositions  document production and other matters  cash to pay legal fees and costs incurred by our lawyers  and cash to pay for other costs of the lawsuits  eg  internal duplication costs  facsimile and telephone communications 
our employees and directors may be distracted by participation in these lawsuits and this may reduce our productivity 
although we expect our insurance to cover much of the legal fees and costs as well as any liability that may result from these lawsuits  we cannot be sure that insurance proceeds will cover all payments we could be required to make 
also  we may not be promptly reimbursed by our insurance providers and may have to make payments in advance of receiving those proceeds 
potential tax liability from our spin offs the tax free nature of our spin offs could be challenged which could result in a significant tax liablity to us and possibly tax liabilities for those who were our stockholders at the time of the spin offs 
if the tax free nature of our spin offs were challenged successfully  we would be required to pay a significant tax liability 
in connection with the strategic restructuring plan  we received an opinion from our counsel that the spin offs were not taxable under section of the code 
that opinion is not binding upon either the internal revenue service or any court 
we cannot be sure that the tax free nature of our spin offs will not be challenged by the internal revenue service 
if the internal revenue service were to challenge successfully the tax free nature of a spin off  we would be taxed on the gain that we would have recognized if we had sold the common stock of the spin off company for its fair market value on the date the spin offs occurred 
in addition  in some cases  each person that was one of our stockholders at the time of the spin offs would be treated as having received a taxable corporate distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the common stock of the spin off company distributed to that stockholder on the date of the distribution 
limitations on issuing additional stock tax rules may limit our ability to raise capital by issuing more common stock 
in order to preserve the tax free nature of spin offs in our strategic restructuring plan we may be subject to internal revenue code section e restrictions on our ability to issue stock 
these restrictions may prevent us from entering into transactions involving sales of our stock that we would otherwise believe to be beneficial 
generally  these restrictions prevent us from issuing our stock if the issuance is part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes one or more of the spin offs  and as part of the plan or series of related transactions  one or more persons acquires stock of our company that represents or more of the voting power or our company or or more of the value or our company s stock 
uncertainties of our foreign operations our foreign operations face additional uncertainties that may harm our operating results 
our operations in new zealand and australia and to a lesser extent in the united kingdom are subject to a number of risks that are different or more intense than the risks we face in north america 
these risks include the following we face a few strong competitors in new zealand and australia  and our market share and margins are directly affected by the actions of these competitors 
they could take action that would reduce our market share or profits 
the market in australia is large and widely dispersed and there are many competitors 
we may be unable to reach a large enough portion of the market to operate at a cost sufficiently low to be profitable over the long run 
because of our geographic distance from these operations  we may find it difficult to anticipate changes in the business environment in our foreign locations such as legal and regulatory requirements  availability of labor  or other changes in economic  political  or social conditions 
our inability to anticipate these changes may impair our ability to react as promptly as local competitors  thus reducing our market share 
our ability to monitor and control management of foreign operations is reduced because of their remote location 
we may fail to promptly detect management or operational problems and may have more difficulty effecting change in these locations 
unpredictability of mbe revenues revenues from franchises of mbe may be unpredictable because we have very limited control over franchisees 
business at mbe is conducted primarily through franchisees and licensees and we have limited control over these operations 
our control is limited by our contractual relationships with these franchisees and licensees  and significant government regulation over the franchisee relationship 
accordingly  we may not be able to correct operational problems at franchises and we may not be able to react promptly and effectively to changes in business conditions 
as a result  franchises may experience increased costs or decreased revenue  which could cause our franchise revenue to go down unexpectedly 
significant technology investment by mbe mbe s expansion into the online shipping services business and mbe s upgrade of technology at its domestic franchises may fail to produce a desirable return 
mbe is in the process of investing approximately million to expand its presence in the online shipping services business and to introduce state of the art technology to its network of domestic franchises 
we cannot be sure that these investment decisions will result in a profitable return for mbe and our company 
stock sale by our major stockholder the market price of our stock could drop significantly if the investment fund affiliated with clayton  dubilier rice decided to sell a significant portion of its shares at any one time and the prospect of a sale by them might depress our stock price 
the investment fund affiliated with clayton  dubilier rice currently owns approximately million shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock convertible into million shares of our common stock 
the preferred stock converts into common stock only if the fund sells the shares to an independent third party 
the investment fund also has rights to buy additional shares of our common stock that could increase its ownership by an additional million shares of our stock in the future 
our agreements with the fund limit its ability to sell its shares but the fund will be able to sell its shares beginning in june  and they can require us to facilitate an underwritten offering in some cases as early as june if the fund decides to sell a significant portion of its shares at any one time  or if the market expects that the fund may sell its shares  the market price of our common stock could drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
intangible assets many of our assets are so called intangible assets 
if we sell or close our businesses  buyers may not pay as much for these intangible assets as we expect 
as of the end of fiscal year  approximately million or of our total assets represented so called intangible assets 
the majority of these intangible assets fall in the category of goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
if we sell our business  we cannot be sure that a buyer would value these intangible assets as high as we do 
if we close our business  those assets may lose most or all of their value and would not be available to be used to repay our creditors or distribute to our investors 
liability for costs of our spin offs we may still be liable for costs related to the businesses we spun off in as part of the strategic restructuring plan  the businesses we spun off in agreed to indemnify us for any payments we made related to  among other things  the operation of the businesses we spun off and some of the lawsuits we are currently defending 
we cannot be sure that all of the spin off companies will be able to satisfy these obligations 
if a spin off company fails to indemnify us for a particular liability  we will be required to satisfy the payment obligation instead 
also  we agreed to indemnify the fund affiliated with clayton  dubilier rice for any losses we suffer as a result of a spin off company failing to meet its indemnity obligations as described above 
changes in senior management recent changes in senior management in the last year may impair our ability to operate effectively 
we have had several recent changes in our senior management 
transition at this high management level may disrupt our operations for the immediate period of time it may be difficult for our employees to adjust to new management styles and to new programs being implemented by this management 
also  we cannot be sure that the individuals in these re assigned or new positions will perform as well as we expect 
we have also made changes  and continue to make changes  to the management of our local operations
