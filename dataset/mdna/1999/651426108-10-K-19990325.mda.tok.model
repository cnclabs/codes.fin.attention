year issue the year issue concerns the possibility that computer programs with date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year  rather than as the year  because the programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations such as  among others  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
readiness the company s year remediation efforts are progressing appropriately 
at the end of  a year task force was formed to coordinate company wide efforts to be year compliant 
to date  the company has inventoried its internal systems as well as identified systems and applications outside of the company that may include imbedded computer technology that could be impacted by the year issue 
as a result of the company s comprehensive review of its internal systems in  and for other strategic reasons  the company is replacing its computerized accounting system 
the company successfully converted to the new accounting system on january   except for the payroll and human resources subsystem which the company projects will be completed by april  the company has made significant progress in modifying existing software to be retained to be year compliant 
completion of these system changes is planned for the first half of  which will allow adequate time for testing 
significant vendors  consultants  suppliers and governmental agencies collectively  business partners were sent a questionnaire on their year compliance efforts 
nearly all have responded to this request 
the company made selected site visits before the end of to assess the year compliance efforts of these business partners 
costs the company estimates the total cost of its compliance efforts in connection with the year issue will be approximately  and will be expensed as incurred 
as of december    had been expensed for this project 
the majority of the expenditures in the future is expected to be for third party computer analysts to complete the modification and testing of existing software for year compliance 
in addition  the cost of the new accounting system is approximately million and is being capitalized and amortized over its useful life 
the cost of the year issue and the estimated completion dates are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will prove accurate and actual results could differ from those estimated 
risks the company believes the worst case scenario for the year issue would be for the company or a significant number of its business partners to fail to successfully complete their respective year remediation efforts by december  under this scenario  the company s operations would most likely be disrupted which would result in a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
contingency plans the company expects to develop by june contingency plans for business partners that do not indicate year compliance 
there can be no assurance that any contingency plans developed by the company will prevent any service interruption on the part of one or more of the company s business partners or that such service interruption would not have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
a failure of the accounting systems of a significant number of the company s customers or business partners  or any of their financial institutions or lenders  would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
inflation  risks and related factors affecting forward looking information this report and other published reports by the company contain forward looking statements regarding the status of proposed or pending sales and rental activity  future planned development  plus the long term growth goals of the company 
the forward looking statements made in this report are based  in part  on present trends the company is experiencing in residential  industrial and commercial markets 
also  the company s success in obtaining entitlements  governmental and environmental regulations  timing of escrow closings  expansion of its income portfolio and marketplace acceptance of its business strategies are among the factors that could affect results 
the following risks and related factors  among others  should be taken into consideration in evaluating the future prospects for the company 
actual results may materially differ from those predicted 
sales of real estate the majority of the company s revenues are generated by its real estate operations 
the ability of the company to consummate sales of real estate is dependent on various factors including  but not limited to  availability of financing to the buyer  regulatory and legal issues and successful completion of the buyer s due diligence 
the fact that a real estate transaction has entered escrow does not necessarily mean that the transaction will ultimately close 
therefore  the timing of sales may differ from that anticipated by the company 
the inability to close sales as anticipated could adversely impact the recognition of revenue in any specific period 
economic conditions real estate development is significantly impacted by general and local economic conditions which are beyond the control of the company 
the company s real estate operations are concentrated in southern california 
the regional economy is profoundly affected by the entertainment  technology  defense and certain other segments  which have been known to affect the region s demographics 
consequently  all sectors of real estate development for the company tend to be cyclical 
while the economy of southern california has shown improvements recently  there can be no assurances that present trends will continue 
interest rates and financing fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of financing have an important impact on the company s performance 
sales of the company s projects could be adversely impacted by the inability of buyers to obtain adequate financing 
further  the company s real estate development activities are dependent on the availability of adequate sources of capital 
certain of the company s credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and would be negatively impacted by increasing interest rates 
competition the sale and leasing of residential  industrial and commercial real estate is highly competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources 
the degree of competition is affected by such factors as the supply of real estate available which is comparable to that sold and leased by the company and the level of demand for such real estate 
while the company recently has continued to increase its market share at both the local and the county level  new competition is expected to deliver competing projects in the future that could reverse this trend 
geographic concentration the company s real estate development activities are focused on its  acres in los angeles county  miles north of los angeles 
the company s entire commercial income portfolio is located in the valencia area 
therefore  any factors affecting that concentrated area  such as changes in the housing market  economic changes and environmental factors  including seismic activity  which cannot be predicted with certainty  could affect future results 
government regulation and entitlement risks in developing its projects  the company must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities regulating such matters as permitted land uses  density and traffic  and the providing of utility services such as electricity  water and waste disposal 
in addition  the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
this government regulation affects the types of projects which can be pursued by the company and increases the cost of development and ownership 
the company devotes substantial financial and managerial resources to comply with these requirements 
to varying degrees  certain permits and approvals will be required to complete the developments currently being undertaken  or planned by the company 
furthermore  the timing  cost and scope of planned projects may be subject to legal challenges  particularly large projects with regional impacts 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to factors such as changes in policies  rules and regulations and their interpretation and application 
the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits for its projects can be beyond the company s control and could restrict or prevent development of otherwise desirable new properties 
the company s results of operations in any period will be affected by the amount of entitled properties the company has in inventory 
inflation the company believes it is well positioned against the effects of inflation 
historically  during periods of inflation  the company has been able to increase selling prices of properties to offset rising costs of land development and construction 
recently  land values have been increasing at a faster rate than costs 
however  there are no assurances that this trend will continue 
a portion of the commercial income portfolio is protected from inflation since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in the company s leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation  while the underlying value of commercial properties has tended to rise over the long term
