the company had positive working capital at march  of million  as compared to a working capital deficit of  at february  and positive working capital of million at february  cash flows used by investing activities were million in fiscal the primary components of net cash used in investing activities were cash used to purchase pierre in june and capital expenditures relating to the opening of thirteen new restaurants in fiscal  as previously discussed  offset slightly by collections on notes payable to the company and proceeds from the sale of assets 
cash acquisitions of fixed assets were million for fiscal this compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal financing and investing activities also include noncash transactions involving capital leases for certain restaurant and food processing equipment  the result of which is to increase long term debt and property 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company acquired fixed assets primarily operating equipment under capital leases of approximately   and  respectively 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million  approximately  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the major components of financing activities in fiscal included the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes due the notes and an initial borrowing under a new five year  million revolving credit facility  with availability subject to a borrowing base formula 
the proceeds of these financing activities were used to acquire pierre  extinguish all existing debt of the company  with the exception of outstanding industrial revenue bonds and certain lease obligations and repurchase  shares of the company s common stock 
during fiscal  the company entered into an agreement with a bank to provide a million revolving credit facility  secured by a lien on inventory and receivables 
proceeds from this credit facility were used to pay off all debt of the company existing at the time  with the exception of outstanding industrial revenue bonds and certain lease obligations 
the company also obtained construction loans from a bank in amounts of up to million per restaurant to finance the construction of new restaurants 
borrowings under the million revolving credit facility and all other bank debt were paid off during fiscal with proceeds from the new million revolving credit facility 
as of march   the company had a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of four banks 
this facility is a five year revolving line of credit expiring june  under which the company may borrow up to an amount including standby letters of credit up to million equal to the lesser of million or a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and real property 
funds available under the facility may be used for working capital requirements  permitted acquisitions  permitted investments and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facility will bear interest at floating rates based upon the interest rate option selected from time to time by the company 
as of march   the company had approximately million in outstanding borrowings  million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility and approximately million of additional availability under the facility 
the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to finance part of the pierre acquisition  restaurant conversions and construction and working capital needs of all business segments 
these borrowings are classified as long term debt on the balance sheet 
the company anticipates that its cash requirements  including working capital  capital expenditures and required principal and interest payments due under the revolving credit facility and interest payments due on the notes  which represent significant liquidity requirements  will be met through a combination of funds provided by operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  from time to time  the company expects to continue its practice of acquiring equipment with the proceeds of capital or operating leases as permitted under such facility 
the company has budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures in its current fiscal year 
these expenditures are being devoted to i routine restaurant equipment and building upgrading and maintenance approximately million  ii the food processing segment approximately million and iii other miscellaneous expenditures approximately million 
the company believes that funds from operations and funds from existing credit agreements  as well as the company s ability to enter into capital or operating leases  will be adequate to finance these capital expenditures 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations for fiscal  fiscal or fiscal seasonality the company considers its restaurant operations to be somewhat seasonal in nature  with stronger sales during the christmas season and spring  weaker sales during the mid summer and late winter 
except for sales to school districts  which decline significantly during the summer and early january  there is no seasonal variation in the company s sales of food products 
the company s food production is steady throughout the year 
sales for the company s ham curing division are seasonal in nature  with sales volume increases occurring around the easter  thanksgiving and christmas holiday seasons 
year issues the year problem arose because many existing computer programs use only the last two digits to refer to a year 
if not addressed  computer programs that are date sensitive may not have the ability to properly recognize dates in the year and beyond 
the result could be a temporary disruption of operations and the processing of transactions 
the company developed a four phase approach to addressing this problem 
phase was an analysis to identify the impact and costs relating to year  both in computer information systems and other equipment 
phase was the creation of a comprehensive plan to address and fix any problems identified 
phase is the implementation of the comprehensive plan 
in phase  the company is to address any unforeseen complications or issues not previously addressed 
the company has completed phase and phase phase  relating to the company s systems  both information technology and non information technology  was substantially complete at the end of calendar year  with most of the systems year compliant 
testing of compliance is continuing 
additionally  as part of phase  the company has sent year questionnaires to vendors and other entities with which the company conducts business in order to assess whether they are year compliant or have adequately addressed their system conversion requirements 
more than two thirds of all vendors and other entities and substantially all major vendors and other entities receiving questionnaires from the company have responded 
the vast majority of vendors and other entities responding have done so by offering assurances that they are either currently year compliant or have a plan in place to be year compliant in a timely manner 
the company plans to validate readiness responses for its key relationships as it assesses its contingency planning requirements 
for those vendors that have responded with substandard assurance  the company is seeking alternative sources of supply 
the company has sent out a second inquiry to those vendors and other entities that had not responded to the initial mailing 
the company cannot predict how many  if any  of the responses it receives may prove later to be inaccurate or overly optimistic 
the company is continuing to develop contingency plans  which are based on its actual testing experience and an assessment of outside risks  to address unanticipated interruptions or down time in both the company s and third parties systems and services 
the costs to implement the company s plan through march  were  and are being expensed as incurred 
the estimated cost to complete phase is  these costs exclude the costs of purchasing year compliant computer programs that would have been purchased in the ordinary course of business regardless of year concerns 
as of march   the company is on schedule to complete phase by september  the company is continuing to closely monitor adherence to the implementation plan and is currently satisfied that it will be completed in the scheduled time frame 
if  however  the company encounters unforeseen complications or issues not previously addressed in the comprehensive plan phase  then additional resources would be committed to complete the necessary conversions in the required time frame 
the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario facing the company s food processing business is that production would be interrupted and distribution of products to customers would be delayed  resulting in revenue and profit losses until the problems could be corrected 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario relative to the restaurant business is the failure to capture individual restaurant revenues and other information electronically 
the company does not expect these events to occur and thus has no plans for handling them other than being aware that data can be captured and accounted for temporarily by non electronic means 
since the company has no reason to believe that it will need to use additional phase resources  no estimate as to their cost has been made at this time 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires that an entity recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in its balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
the company will be required to adopt this new statement for its fiscal year ending march  management is currently evaluating the impact of this statement 
in march  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
sop provides guidance on the types of internal costs  including payroll and interest costs  which should be capitalized relative to development of software applications 
the company will be required to adopt this new statement for fiscal the company is in the process of evaluating this statement and does not expect any material effect on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company owned no derivative financial instruments at march   february  or february  the company holds no financial instruments of any kind for trading purposes 
certain of the company s outstanding financial instruments are subject to market risks  including interest rate risk 
such financial instruments are not currently subject to foreign currency risk or commodity price risk 
the company s major market risk exposure is potential loss arising from changing interest rates and the impact of such changes on its long term debt 
the company s policy is to manage interest rate risk by issuing a combination of fixed and variable rate debt in amounts and with maturities that management considers appropriate 
of the company s long term debt outstanding at march   million principal amount was accruing interest at a variable rate 
a rise in prevailing interest rates could have adverse effects on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
march  expected maturities in fiscal years there fair after total value long term debt fixed rate         weighted average interest rate variable rate         weighted average interest rate
