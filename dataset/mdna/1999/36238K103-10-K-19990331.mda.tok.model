item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the financial statements and notes 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
overview gtsi is one of the largest dedicated resellers of microcomputer and unix workstation hardware  software and networking products to the government 
the company currently offers access to over  information technology products from more than  manufacturers 
gtsi also performs network integration services  including configuring  installing and maintaining microcomputers in local area networks 
the company sells to virtually all departments and agencies of the government  many state governments and several hundred systems integrators and prime contractors that sell to the government market 
gtsi offers its customers a convenient and cost effective centralized source for microcomputer and workstation products through its competitive pricing  broad product selection and procurement expertise 
the company provides its vendors with a low cost marketing and distribution channel to the millions of end users comprising the government market  while virtually insulating these vendors from most of the complex government procurement rules and regulations 
changes in sales throughout the company s history have been attributable to increased or decreased unit sales  to expansion of the company s product offerings eg  peripherals  microcomputers and networking and workstation products  from through  to the addition of new vendors eg  ibm  sun  panasonic  apple and nexar  from through  and cisco in  and to the addition or expiration of sales contract vehicles eg  the addition of the sewp ii contract  the nih ecs ii contract  the tda contract and stamis contract  and the expiration of the companion contract in and desktop iv systems ordering in 
the company s financial results have fluctuated seasonally  and may continue to do so in the future  because of the government s buying patterns which have historically favorably impacted the last two calendar quarters and adversely affected the first two calendar quarters 
the company s primary strategy is to focus on its core gsa schedule and idiq business and to compete aggressively on bids in order to win as many contract vehicles as possible under the various purchasing programs available to it in the government market 
with these contract vehicles in place  it is then possible for the company to use its significant product base and marketing knowledge to sell products which both meet customers requirements and provide an attractive financial return to the company

compared with sales 
sales consist of revenues from product shipments and services rendered net of allowances for customer returns and credits 
during  net sales increased million  or over the primary reason for the increase was higher sales under the company s indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts of approximately million  or 
the increase in idiq contracts was partially offset by decreased gsa schedule sales and open market sales of approximately million  or and million  or  respectively 
management believes that the decline in open market sales is primarily attributable to recent changes in the procurement regulations that allow the government to purchase products by other means eg gsa schedule contracts  government wide agency contract gwac  blanket purchase agreements bpa s in a quicker and easier manner than was the case before such changes 
in addition  the decrease in sales under gsa schedule contracts can be attributed primarily to decreased sales relating to gsa schedule b c contract of million offset by an increase in bpa sales of million from the same period last year 
in  gsa schedule contracts expressly authorized agencies to procure from schedule holders under bpa s which incorporate many terms and conditions of the gsa schedule contracts 
additionally  bpa s offer many of the same products as gsa schedules  often at lower prices than available on gsa schedules 
in response to gsa s authorization  the company has increased its emphasis on bpa s 
sales under idiq contracts increased primarily as result of increased sales under contracts with the state department  the army s pc and the tennessee valley authority  totaling million 
the company performs  as a subcontractor  under these contracts as a result of the acquisition of the btg division 
in addition  the company s contract with the us army s standard army management information systems stamis computer contract ii  which was awarded in november  produced sales of million during total booked backlog at december  was approximately million compared to million at december  total booked backlog was million at february   up million or compared to february  booked backlog represents orders received but product has yet to ship 
gross margin 
in  gross margin increased in absolute dollars million  or  and increased as a percentage of sales from to  when compared to the increase in gross margin was impacted by an inventory adjustment of approximately million resulting from a june physical inventory valuation 
gross margin for was  including the impact of the inventory adjustment 
in addition  gross margins were favorably impacted by change in the company s mix of contract vehicles 
gross margins for  were also impacted by the realization of greater contract price protection credits offset by increased warranty maintenance expense 
the change in gross margin percentage can be impacted by a variety of factors and is not necessarily indicative of gross margin percentages to be earned in the future periods 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses for increased million  or compared to this increase was due primarily to increased personnel cost as a result of the btg division acquisition  as well as increases in the overall volume of the business 
in addition  the company incurred approximately million of operating costs associated with the acquisition of the btg division 
total operating expenses  as a percentage of total sales decreased from to  reflecting the company s growth in sales requiring less additional infrastructure expenses as existing facilities and personnel are utilized more effectively 
interest expense 
net interest expense is the amount of interest expense on borrowings offset by interest income and prompt payment discounts 
the net interest expense increased approximately  or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was due primarily to increased average borrowings as a result of increased sales volumes  as well as additional borrowings required for the btg division acquisition 
in addition  during the company utilized more prompt payment discounts as compared to the same period in income taxes 
no provision for income tax has been recognized with respect to the company s income from operations for due to the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance that fully offset the company s current tax expenses for compared with sales 
during  net sales decreased million or and were negatively impacted by million in higher industrial funding fees associated with the gsa and nih contracts 
these fees are collected by the company and remitted to the respective agency on a payment schedule determined by the respective agency 
decreased sales under gsa schedule and under open market contracts of million and million  respectively  were offset by increased sales under gtsi s various idiq contracts 
it is management s belief that the decline in open market sales is primarily attributable to recent changes in the procurement regulations that allow the government to purchase products by other means eg  gsa schedule contracts in a quicker and easier manner than was the case before such changes 
idiq contract sales rose during primarily as a result of higher revenue on the company s nih  tda and sewp contracts 
revenue from these contracts rose million  million and million  respectively  from however  higher sales from the nih  tda and sewp vehicles were offset by weaker sales activity on the gsa schedule b c contract 
sales of hewlett packard  compaq  panasonic  microsoft and nexar products increased million from the prior year and accounted for of gtsi s total sales activity by vendor 
this increase was offset by lower sales of ibm label products which decreased by million from the prior year 
total backlog at december   was approximately million  down from approximately million at december  backlog was million at march  compared to million in the prior period 
the increase is primarily related to orders that were recorded as part of the btg division acquisition  which closed on february  backlog represents orders received but for which product has yet to ship 
gross margin 
gross margin increased in by approximately million or  and increased as a percentage of sales from to 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded million in adjustments that were deemed necessary to provide for contractual obligations  and to reduce certain trade credits to the amounts ultimately expected to be realized 
other product cost factors that contributed to the improvement in the gross margin percentage during were the recognition of greater price protection credits 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in decreased approximately million  or  and improved as a percentage of sales from to 
the change is primarily attributable to a million decrease in amortization expense associated with the accelerated write down of intangible assets which was recognized during the fourth quarter of interest expense 
total interest charges between and were relatively flat  although bank administrative and credit card fees were higher in by approximately million from the prior period 
these costs were offset by lower interest expenses due to reduced bank borrowings during certain times throughout income taxes 
in  a tax benefit of million was recorded as a result of the company s operating loss for that period  that was realized by carrying back the loss to prior years in which the company recognized taxable income 
new accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  was adopted by the company during the first quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of approximately million related to the impairment of intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of falcon in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  was adopted by the company during this statement requires disclosure of the fair value of all stock based compensation using one of several option pricing models 
sfas  earnings per share  and sfas  disclosure of information about capital structure  were adopted by the company in the fourth quarter of  with no material effect on the company s consolidated financial statement presentation 
sfas  reporting comprehensive income  was adopted by the company in and in accordance therewith  the company s comprehensive income equals reported net income loss 
sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  was adopted by the company in the fourth quarter of effect of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its operations 
however  in the event inflation increases in the future it could temporarily adversely affect the profitability of gtsi s sales under its government fixed price contracts  which generally preclude the company from passing on inflation related or other increases in product costs to government customers during the term of a pre existing contract 
the company mitigates this risk in part by often obtaining agreements from certain of its suppliers prohibiting them from increasing their prices to gtsi during fixed price  term contracts 
seasonal fluctuations and other factors the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience significant seasonal fluctuations in its operations as a result of government buying and funding patterns  which also impact the buying patterns of gtsi s prime contractor customers 
these buying and funding patterns historically have had a significant positive effect on gtsi s bookings in the third quarter ending september each year the government s fiscal year end  and consequently on sales and net income in the third and fourth quarters of each year 
quarterly financial results are also affected by the timing of the award of and shipments of products under government contracts  price competition in the microcomputer and workstation industries  the addition of personnel or other expenses in anticipation of sales growth  product line changes and expansions  and the timing and costs of changes in customer and product mix 
in addition  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new product releases by leading microcomputer and workstation hardware and software manufacturers  delays in vendor shipments of new or existing products  a shift in sales mix to more complex requirements contracts with more complex service costs  and vendor delays in the processing of incentives and credits due gtsi  have occurred all of which are also likely to occur in the future and have adversely affected the company s operating performance in particular periods 
the seasonality and the unpredictability of the factors affecting such seasonality make gtsi s quarterly and yearly financial results difficult to predict and subject to significant fluctuation 
the company s stock price could be adversely affected if any such financial results fail to meet the financial community s expectations 
additionally  legislation is periodically introduced in congress that may change the government s procurement practices 
gtsi cannot predict whether any legislative or any regulatory proposals will be adopted or  if adopted  the impact upon its operating results 
changes in the structure  composition and or buying patterns of the government  either alone or in combination with competitive conditions or other factors  could adversely affect future results

year impact of year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the millennium year approaches 
the year problem is complex as certain computer operations will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to the issue is whether computers systems will properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
assessments of the potential effects of the year issue vary markedly among different companies  governments  consultants and economists  and it is not possible to predict what the actual impact may be 
given this uncertainty  the company recognizes the need to remain vigilant and is continuing its analysis  assessment and planning for the various year issues  across the entire business 
state of readiness 
the company s primary focus has been on its own internal information technology systems  including all types of systems in use by the company in its operations  marketing  finance and human resources departments  and to deal with the most critical systems first 
the company has formed an action team representing every functional area of the company  with the chairman and ceo as the executive sponsor  and the senior executive management staff as the steering committee  of the team 
the year plan is comprehensive and auditable  and involves generally the following phases inventory  risk classification  assessment  remediation  and testing 
the scope of the plan is broad and addresses critical suppliers  internal systems and processes  and customers 
with respect to its internal information technology systems  the company has conducted an inventory of a substantial majority of its central systems for year compliance 
the most significant risk faced by the company is the just in time jit application  the company s key enterprise operations system 
the company completed jit year conversion and testing in early the company has begun implementing remediation plans for other material information technology systems 
in addition  the company currently is reviewing its other non critical internal information technology systems 
with respect to the company s non information technology systems  the company moved its headquarters to a new location during the end of all systems in the new facility are year compliant 
the company has begun to assess the potential for year problems with the information systems of its customers and vendors 
the company has sent questionnaires to the primary product vendors with which the company has a material relationship 
the company is in the process of assessing the responses received to date from the vendors and plans to follow up with vendors that have not responded 
the company does not have sufficient information to provide an estimated timetable for completion of renovation and testing that such parties with which the company has a material relationship may undertake 
the company is unable to estimate the costs that it may incur to remedy the year issues relating to such parties 
the company s primary customer is the federal government 
various departments in the federal government have achieved different degrees of readiness regarding year compliance 
costs to address year issues 
the company presently estimates that the cost associated with becoming year compliant is approximately million  approximately  of that has been incurred since december  any external and internal costs specifically associated with modifying internal use software for the year will be charged to expense as incurred in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board issue no 
 accounting for the costs associated with modifying computer software for the year the costs associated with the replacement of computerized systems  hardware or equipment will be capitalized and are included in the above estimate 
these costs do not include any costs associated with the implementation of contingency plans 
the company s year program is an ongoing process and the estimate of costs and completion dates for various components of the program above are subject to change 
the present cost estimates of the company s year identification  assessment  remediation and testing efforts and the dates on which the company believes it will complete such efforts are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions regarding future events  including among other factors the continued availability of certain resources 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated 
specific factors that could cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in year issues  the ability to identify  assess  remediate  and test all relevant computer codes  third party remediation plans  and similar uncertainties 
risks to the company 
the government includes certain year warranty clauses in its contracts  which the company executes 
the company strives to pass the government contract clauses on to its product vendors  however  in some instances vendors refuse to accept such clauses 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely effected if the government were to enforce these clauses and the company did not have corresponding protection from such vendors 
in addition  it is unknown how government and other customer spending patterns may be impacted by year issues 
as customers focus on preparing their business for the year  information technology budgets may be spent on remediation efforts  potentially delaying the purchase and implementation of new systems  thereby creating less demand for the company s products and services 
the year presents a number of other risks and uncertainties that could affect the company  including utilities failures and competition for personnel skilled in the resolution of year issues 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty of the year readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
contingency plan 
the company has not yet established a contingency plan to address the most reasonably likely worst case scenario and such scenario has not yet been identified 
the company currently plans to complete such analysis and contingency planning by december  safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the renegotiation of the financial covenants contained in the credit facility  and the statements which are not historical facts contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements  are forward looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially based on numerous factors  including but not limited to competition in the government markets  spending patterns of the company s customers  general economic and political conditions  success of negotiations with the company s lenders  changes in government procurement regulations  impact of the year issue on the company s business  and other risks described in this annual report on form k and in the company s other securities and exchange commission filings
