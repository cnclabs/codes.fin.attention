beginning in july  the company has bought and sold lpg for distribution into northeast mexico and the us rio grande valley 
historically  the company has derived substantially all of its revenues from sales to pmi  its primary customer  of lpg purchased from exxon 
in fiscal  the company derived approximately of its revenues from sales of lpg 
the company provides products and services through a combination of fixed margin and fixed price contracts 
under the company s agreements with its customers and suppliers  the buying and selling prices of lpg are based on variable posted prices that provide the company with a fixed margin 
costs included in cost of goods sold other than the purchase price of lpg may affect actual profits from sales  including costs relating to transportation  storage  leases  maintenance and financing 
the company generally attempts to purchase in volumes commensurate with projected sales 
however  mismatches in volumes and prices of lpg purchased from exxon and resold to pmi could result in unanticipated costs

due to the availability of net operating loss carryforwards million and million at july  and  there was no income tax expense in either year 
the ability to use such net operating loss carryforwards  which expire in the years to  may be significantly limited by the application of the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code

pmi sales agreement 
the pmi sales agreement is effective for the period from october  through september  and provides for the purchase by pmi of minimum monthly volumes of lpg aggregating a minimum annual volume of million gallons  similar to minimum volume requirements under the previous sales agreement with pmi effective during the period from october  to september  during june  the pmi sales agreement was amended the pmi sales agreement amendment to extend the expiration date until march  and to provide the company with additional margins for any volume exceeding million gallons per month during the summer period april september and million gallons per month during the winter period october march 
under the pmi sales agreement amendment  pmi is obligated to purchase a minimum volume of million gallons during october through march lpg supply agreement 
during october  the company entered into a monthly supply agreement with exxon pursuant to which exxon agreed to supply minimum volumes of lpg to the company 
effective november   the company entered into a supply agreement with exxon to purchase minimum monthly volumes of lpg through september the company believes it has access to an adequate supply of lpg from exxon and other suppliers to satisfy the requirements of pmi under the pmi sales agreement 
effective october  the exxon closing date  the company and exxon entered into a ten year lpg supply contract the exxon supply contract  whereby exxon has agreed to supply and the company has agreed to take  the supply of propane and butane available at exxon s king ranch gas plant the plant which is estimated to be between million gallons per month and million gallons per month blended in accordance with the specifications outlined under the pmi sales agreement the plant commitment  with a minimum of million gallons per month guaranteed by exxon to be provided to the company 
in addition  under the terms of the exxon supply contract  exxon will make operational its corpus christi pipeline the ccpl which when completed  will allow the company to acquire an additional supply of propane from other propane suppliers located near corpus christi  texas the additional propane supply  and bring the additional propane supply to the plant the ccpl supply for blending to the proper specifications outlined under the pmi sales agreement and then delivered into the pipeline 
in connection with the ccpl supply  the company has agreed to supply a minimum of million gallons into the ccpl during the first quarter from the date that the ccpl is operational  approximately million gallons the following year and million gallons each year thereafter and continuing for four years 
the exxon supply contract currently requires that the company purchase a minimum supply of lpg  which is significantly higher than committed sales volumes under the pmi sales agreement 
in addition  the company is required to pay additional fees associated with the additional propane supply  which will increase its lpg costs by a minimum of 
per gallon without considering the actual cost of the additional supply charged to the company 
in september  the company and pg e ngl marketing  lp pg e entered into a three year supply agreement the pg e supply agreement whereby pg e has agreed to supply and the company has agreed to take  a monthly average of million gallons the pg e supply of propane 
in addition  pg e is in the process of obtaining up to million gallons per month of additional propane commitments  which if successful by december   would be an adjustment to the pg e supply 
under the pg e supply agreement  the company is not obligated to purchase the pg e supply until the ccpl is operational  anticipated to be during october under the terms of the pg e supply agreement  the pg e supply will be delivered to the ccpl  as described above  and blended to the proper specifications as outlined under the pmi sales agreement 
in addition  by utilizing the pg e supply  the company would satisfy the ccpl supply requirements under the exxon supply contract 
in connection with the plant commitment and the pg e supply  the company anticipates lower gross margins on its sales of lpg under the pmi sales agreement of approximately as a result of increased lpg costs compared with the previous agreements to purchase lpg 
the company may incur significant additional costs associated with storage  disposal and or changes in lpg prices resulting from the excess of the plant commitment and pg e supply over actual sales volumes 
the company believes that the terms of the exxon supply contract and the pg e supply contract are commensurate with the anticipated future demand for lpg in mexico and that any additional costs associated with the additional supply as well as the increase in the costs for lpg over previous agreements will be offset by increased sales margins on lpg sold to the company s customers 
the company further believes that any additional costs incurred in connection with the plant commitment and pg e supply  if any  will be short term in nature 
the ability of the company to increase sales of lpg into mexico in the future is largely dependent on the company s ability to negotiate future contracts with pmi and or with local mexican distributors once deregulation in mexico is implemented 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain terms as favorable as the pmi sales agreement 
in the event that the company is unable to meet its intended lpg sales objectives  then the company may incur significant losses as a result of not being able to meet its minimum purchase requirements under the exxon supply contract and the pg e supply contract and or the costs of lpg may be in excess of prices received on sales of lpg 
furthermore  until the us mexico pipeline and mexican terminal facilities and saltillo terminal facilities are completed  the company will be required to deliver the minimum monthly volumes from its brownsville terminal facility 
historically  sales of lpg from the brownsville terminal facilities have not exceeded million gallons per month 
in addition  breakdowns along the planned distribution route for the lpg once purchased from pg e and or exxon and or other suppliers  may limit the ability of the company to accept the plant commitment  ccpl supply and or the pg e supply 
under the terms of the exxon supply contract and the pg e supply contract  the company must provide letters of credit in amounts equal to the cost of the product purchased 
the amount of product to be purchased under the exxon supply contract and the pg e supply contract are significantly higher than historical amounts 
in addition  the cost of the product purchased is tied directly to overall market conditions 
as a result  the company s existing letter of credit facility may not be adequate and the company may require additional sources of financing to meet the letter of credit requirements under the exxon supply contract and the pg e supply agreement 
furthermore upon the implementation of deregulation the company anticipates entering into contracts with mexican customers which require payments in pesos 
in addition the mexican customers may be limited in their ability to provide adequate financing 
as a result of the exxon supply contract and the pg e supply contract  the company believes that its has an adequate supply of lpg to satisfy the requirements of pmi under the pmi sales agreement and to meet its future sales obligations  if any  upon the expiration of the pmi sales agreement 
due to strategic location of the company s pipelines and terminal facilities  the company believes that it will be able to achieve higher margins on the sale of lpg in the future 
in determining whether any supplier will be utilized  the company will consider the applicable prices charged as well as any additional fees that may be required to be paid under the pipeline lease 
beginning in october  the company s gross margins on its lpg sales were reduced by as a result of increased lpg costs compared with the previous agreements 
pipeline lease 
the pipeline lease currently expires on december   pursuant to an amendment the pipeline lease amendment entered into between the company and seadrift on may   which became effective on january  the effective date 
the pipeline lease amendment provides  among other things  for additional storage access and inter connection with another pipeline controlled by seadrift  thereby providing greater access to and from the pipeline 
pursuant to the pipeline lease amendment  the company s fixed annual fee associated with the use of the pipeline was increased by  less certain adjustments during the first two years from the effective date and the company is required to pay for a minimum volume of storage of  per year beginning the second year from the effective date 
in addition  the pipeline lease amendment provides for variable rental increases based on monthly volumes purchased and flowing into the pipeline and storage utilized 
the company believes that the pipeline lease amendment provides the company increased flexibility in negotiating sales and supply agreements with its customers and suppliers 
the company has made all payments required under the pipeline lease amendment 
present pipeline capacity is approximately million gallons per year 
in fiscal year  the company sold million gallons of lpg which flowed through the pipeline 
the company can increase the pipeline s capacity through the installation of additional pumping equipment 
see lpg expansion program below 
lpg expansion program 
on july   the company was granted a permit by the united states department of state authorizing the company to construct  maintain and operate two pipelines the us pipeline crossing the international boundary line between the united states and mexico from the brownsville terminal facilities near the port of brownsville  texas and el sabino  mexico for the transport of lpg and refined products motor gasoline and diesel fuel 
the refined products 
previously  on july   penn octane de mexico  sa de sa pennmex  an affiliated company  received a permit from the comision reguladora de energia the mexican energy commission to build and operate one pipeline to transport lpg the mexican pipeline 
collectively  the us pipeline and the mexican pipeline are referred to as the us mexico pipeline 
between el sabino at the point north of the rio bravo and to a terminal facility in the city of matamoros  state of tamaulipas  mexico the mexican terminal facilities 
as a result of the above  the company will be able to transport lpg directly from the us into mexico through the us mexico pipeline and to the mexican terminal facilities the expansion 
management believes that as a result of the expansion  the company will have additional strengths due to its ability to penetrate further into mexico  provide greater volumes of lpg as a result of reduced cross border trucking delays and greater access to mexican distribution resources and the potential to achieve greater margins on its lpg sales 
in addition to the expansion  tergas has begun construction of an additional lpg terminal facility in saltillo  mexico the saltillo terminal facilities for an estimated cost of  the saltillo terminal facilities  when complete  will allow for the distribution of lpg by railcars  which will directly link the company s brownsville terminal facility and the saltillo terminal facilities 
the saltillo terminal facilities will contain storage to accommodate approximately  gallons of lpg

the pipeline enhancements will include the installation of additional piping  meters  valves  analyzers and pumps along the pipeline to increase the capacity of the pipeline make the pipeline bi directional 
the pipeline enhancements will increase the capacity of the pipeline to million gallons per year  and will provide the company with access to a greater number of lpg suppliers and additional storage facilities 
the company expects to begin the pipeline enhancements in january and to be completed three months thereafter at a cost of approximately million 
in connection with the expansion  the company and cpsc international  inc cpsc entered into two separate lease installation purchase agreements  as amended  the lease agreements  whereby cpsc will construct the us mexico pipeline including an additional pipeline to accommodate refined products and the mexican terminal facilities and lease these assets to the company
