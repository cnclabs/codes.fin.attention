liquidity and capital resources the company s capital requirements have principally related to the acquisition of businesses  working capital needs and capital expenditures 
these requirements have been met through a combination of bank debt  issuances of securities and internally generated funds 
during  the company made cash payments for acquisitions of million 
these payments were comprised of i million paid to sellers of businesses acquired in  and ii million of post closing purchase consideration earnouts paid to sellers based on the post acquisition increase in earnings before interest and taxes ebit  as defined 
at december   the company accrued million for earnouts that were based upon operating performance 
these earnouts are expected to be paid by the end of april the remaining earnouts are capped at million and are based upon operating performance for based on current growth rates and operating trends  the company estimates the remaining earnouts will be approximately million 
these earnouts will be paid in the first half of the company expects to fund the payment of the earnouts out of borrowings under its senior credit agreement 
capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the majority of these expenditures related to i the development of an integrated front and back office information system for the staffing services business  which was included with the sale of that business  ii computer equipment and software for technical consultants  and iii furniture  fixtures and equipment related to business expansion 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for will be approximately million  half of which relates to the development and implementation of a back office system for all business units and the enhancement or replacement of the existing front office systems 
the new back office system is expected to be operational in mid and most of the business units will be transitioned to the new system by the end of the remaining planned capital expenditures for are normal recurring items necessary to support business expansion and the anticipated growth in the number of technical consultants 
the company expects to fund these capital expenditures primarily out of cash flows from operations and with borrowings under its senior credit agreement 
the company had working capital of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company s operating cash flows and working capital requirements are significantly affected by the timing of payroll and the receipt of payment from the customer 
generally  the company pays its consultants semi monthly and receives payments from customers on average within to days from the date of invoice 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of the strategic repositioning of the company to focus exclusively on its core solutions and project support services businesses  management and the board of directors approved a plan to sell the company s staffing services business 
on july   this business was sold to the corporate services group plc for million in cash  plus excess working capital 
proceeds from the sale were used to repay borrowings under the senior credit agreement 
under terms of the company s senior credit agreement  the company may borrow under its revolving credit facility the lesser of million or times pro forma adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization of all acquired businesses for the preceding twelve month period 
the commitment can be raised to million 
borrowings under the facility bear interest  at the company s option  at libor or the bank s base rate  plus the applicable margin 
a fee of to is payable on the unused portion of the commitment 
the senior credit agreement contains certain covenants which  among other things  limit total debt to times pro forma adjusted ebitda  limit the payment of dividends and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
as of december   the company had outstanding borrowings under the senior credit agreement of million and remaining availability after deducting outstanding letters of credit of million of million 
the weighted average interest rate of the company s outstanding borrowings under the senior credit agreement was at december  on august   the company sold million of convertible subordinated notes due the notes were issued at an original price of of the principal amount at maturity 
the notes are convertible into common stock of the company at a conversion rate of shares per  note 
the notes are redeemable by the company  in whole or in part  after august   at a redemption price equal to the original price of the note plus accrued original issue discount 
net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the notes were used to repay a portion of the indebtedness under the senior credit agreement 
at december   the carrying value of the notes was million 
on june   the company entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement to reduce a portion of its interest rate exposure on borrowings under the senior credit agreement 
under terms of this agreement  the company will pay the counterparty on notional principal of million and the counterparty will pay the company interest at a variable rate based on libor 
on august   the company s board of directors approved a plan for the company to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares at an average price of 
upon repurchase  the shares were retired 
subsequent to december   the company entered into agreements to acquire two businesses  which are expected to close by the end of april after funding these acquisitions and the payment of the accrued earnouts  the company estimates that it will have approximately million of outstanding borrowings under its senior credit agreement 
the company has formally notified the agent bank in the senior credit agreement to increase the commitment as allowed under its terms and it expects this increase will be effective in early april 
this increase in commitment will be sufficient to meet the company s planned capital requirements through early to meet its longer term capital requirements  the company is involved in discussions with its lead commercial banks to expand its senior borrowing capacity 
based on the growth that has occurred in the company s pro forma ebitda since the commitment levels were last set  the company believes that it will be able to increase sufficiently its senior borrowing capacity to meet its longer term capital requirements 
the company expects the expanded credit facility to be in place by the end of the second quarter of the company s capital requirements  which include funding for its acquisition program  are dependent upon  among other things  the number  quality and pricing of the acquisition opportunities and its capital availability 
although the company believes it will be able to maintain a moderately sized acquisition program  a significantly larger program would require additional capital 
although management believes that the company will be able to obtain sufficient capital to fund acquisitions there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to the company at the time it is required or on terms acceptable to the company 
inflation the effects of inflation on the company s operations were not significant during the periods presented in the financial statements 
risk factors our business operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties and future developments that cannot be predicted 
these principal risks and uncertainties are identified below 
forward looking information this annual report contains various forward looking statements and information that are based on management s belief as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology  such as may  will  should  would  expects  plans  anticipates  believes  estimates  predicts  potential  continue  or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology 
any expectations based on these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other important factors  including those discussed in this risk factors section and in the documents that are incorporated by reference 
these and many other factors could affect our future financial and operating results 
these factors could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations based on forward looking statements made in this document or elsewhere by or on behalf of us 
among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on our operating results are fluctuations in the economy  the degree and nature of competition  demand for our services  and our ability to integrate the operations of acquired businesses  to recruit and place information technology consultants  to expand into new markets and to maintain profit margins in the face of pricing pressures 
we encourage you to read carefully our discussion of these factors  as described in the paragraphs below 
fluctuations of quarterly operating results we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results 
our revenues and gross margins in a particular quarter will vary depending upon a number of factors  including o general economic conditions  which may influence our clients and potential clients to invest in their information systems or to downsize their businesses  o the number and requirements of client engagements  o employee hiring  attrition and utilization rates  o changes in the rates we are able to charge clients for our services  o the number of billing days  consultants vacations and paid time off  o seasonality of our clients businesses  o the number  terms and size of acquisitions  if any  during a period  and o other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
since a significant portion of our expenses will not vary relative to the level of revenues  lower than expected revenues may significantly affect operating results 
demand for services in the it services business is typically lower during the first quarter until clients operating budgets are finalized 
the productivity of our salaried technical consultants is lower in the third and fourth quarters due to fewer billing days because of the higher number of holidays and vacation days 
in addition  efforts by our clients to address year issues may absorb a substantial part of their information technology budgets in the near term 
there is much speculation that the cost of year compliance efforts will significantly reduce spending on non year products and services through january   and this may have an effect on demand for our services 
the impact of year issues on our future growth is difficult to assess  but is a risk to be considered in evaluating our growth 
volatility of stock price our stock price has been volatile 
future revenues  earnings and stock prices may be subject to wide swings  particularly on a quarterly basis  in response to variations in operating and financial results  anticipated revenue and or earnings growth rates  competitive pressures  market place conditions and other factors 
our stock price is predominantly based on current expectations of sustainable future revenue and earnings growth rates 
any failure to meet anticipated revenue and earnings levels in a period or any negative change in our perceived long term growth prospects would likely have a significant adverse effect on our stock price 
termination of client contracts fees from project based contracts are a fundamental component of our solutions revenues 
such fees represent an increasingly greater percentage of our total revenues and are dependent upon our clients continuing to perceive an increasing need to use our services on existing and future information technology initiatives 
if our clients information technology requirements or budgets were to decrease in scale or their initiatives delayed and or if such clients were to perceive alternatives to relying upon our current service offerings  our revenues would be adversely impacted 
many of our engagements are terminable without client penalty 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in an increase in underutilized employees and a decrease in revenues and profits 
competition from large competitors and clients internal resources the information technology services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry and rapid change 
the industry is served by many national  regional and local companies  including full service agencies and specialized temporary services agencies 
our primary competitors include a variety of market segments  including o big five accounting firms  o large systems consulting and implementation firms  and o large general management consulting firms 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition 
in addition  we compete with our clients internal resources  particularly where these resources represent a fixed cost to the client 
such competition may impose additional pricing pressures 
we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future 
failure to attract and retain qualified information technology consultants our continued success will depend in large part on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly project managers and other senior technical personnel 
the qualified project managers that we require are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
fixed bid and fee capped projects we undertake projects on a fixed bid or fee capped basis  which are different than our principal method of billing on a time and materials basis 
for the year ended december   we realized approximately of our revenues from fixed bid or fee capped projects 
our failure to complete fixed bid and fee capped projects within budget or below the cap would expose us to cost overruns 
liability for employee and client actions we may incur liability through our placement of consultants in the workplaces of our clients businesses 
risks of such placement include possible claims of o errors and omissions  o misuse of client proprietary information  o misappropriation of funds  o discrimination and harassment  o theft of client property  or o other criminal activity or torts  although historically we have not experienced any material claims of these types  we cannot be certain that we will not experience these types of claims in the future 
to reduce our exposure  we maintain insurance covering general liability and errors and omissions 
however  insurance may not cover all such claims  and insurance coverage may not continue to be available in an amount adequate to cover these types of liabilities 
intellectual property rights our success in the information technology services business depends upon our software deployment and methodology and other proprietary intellectual property rights 
we do not hold any patents or registered copyrights 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and technical measures  and copyright and trademark laws  to protect our proprietary rights 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  clients and potential clients and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
our businesses include the development of custom software applications in connection with specific client engagements 
ownership of such software is generally assigned to the client 
in addition  we develop object oriented software components that can be reused in software application development and certain foundation and application software products  or software tools  most of which remain our property 
although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may nevertheless make infringement claims against the combined company in the future 
development of new solutions our continued success depends in part on our ability to outpace larger and better known competitors 
we must continue to develop information technology solutions that keep pace with rapid changes in information technology  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
if we do not adequately address new developments in a timely manner  we may not be able to keep our present customers or attract new clients 
in addition  products or technologies developed by others may make our services uncompetitive or obsolete 
dependence on a successful acquisition strategy in the past five years  we have grown significantly through acquisitions  and our future growth may be based in part on selected acquisitions 
the competition that we face for acquisition candidates may result in fewer potential acquisitions  as well as less advantageous acquisition terms  such as price 
in addition  our ability to expand successfully by acquisitions depends on our ability to overcome many obstacles  including the successful identification and acquisition of businesses and management s ability to integrate and operate the new businesses effectively 
successful integration of acquired businesses our financial results and prospects depend in large part on our ability to successfully integrate  manage and maintain the operating efficiencies and productivity of acquired businesses 
in particular  our ability to reap the benefits of acquired operations depends on a number of factors  including the ability of the combined companies to o maintain low administrative costs  o successfully combine markets and services offered  o generate economies of scale  and o capitalize on their combined service and marketing base and strategic position 
maintenance of rapid growth we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to expand and successfully manage our growth 
our ability to continue to grow will depend on a number of factors  including the following o competition from other information technology services companies  o availability of capital  o ability to maintain margins  o ability to recruit and train additional qualified personnel  and o management of costs in a changing technological environment 
government regulation of immigration as of december   approximately  of our workforce were information technology consultants who are foreign nationals working in the united states under h b permits 
accordingly  we must comply with united states immigration laws 
due to the limited number of h b permits approved each year  we may not be able to recruit or retain enough information technology professionals to meet our personnel requirements 
furthermore  congress and administrative agencies with jurisdiction over immigration matters periodically express concerns over the levels of legal and illegal immigration into the us these concerns often result in proposed legislation  rules and regulations aimed at reducing the number of work permits that may be issued 
any changes in such laws which make it more difficult to hire foreign nationals or limit our ability to retain foreign employees could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses 
significant exposure to international markets we currently have international operations in india  europe and australia and expect that international operations will account for an increasingly significant percentage of our operations 
as of december   approximately of our revenues resulted from our international operations 
as a result  our operations are subject to the following risks o difficulties relating to the global administration of its business  o managing foreign operations  o currency fluctuations  o restrictions against the repatriation of earnings  o export requirements and restrictions  and o multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures 
our failure to manage growth  attract and retain personnel and profitably deliver services or transmit data via satellite could have an adverse impact on our international operations 
exposure to conditions in india india is currently the most significant of our international operations 
although wage costs in india are significantly lower than in the us and elsewhere for comparably skilled information technology consultants  wages in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the us we are subject to the risks of changes in inflation  interest rates  taxation  regulation or other social  political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india 
increased risk related to century date compliance engagements the market demand for century date compliance services will likely decrease substantially  and eventually cease  during and after the year many of metamor s engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of their clients businesses 
the failure or inability of metamor to complete engagements to its clients satisfaction could have an adverse effect on such clients operations and could consequently subject the company to litigation or damage its reputation  which could have an adverse effect on metamor s business  financial condition and operating results 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
we have assessed our internal computer systems and have determined that we will be required to modify  replace or delete portions of our software and hardware so that those systems will properly recognize dates beyond december  we currently believe that with modifications of existing software and hardware  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and replacements are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
our plan to resolve the year issue involves the following four phases assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
to date  we have completed our assessment of all critical systems that could be significantly affected by the year based on this assessment  we have selected year compliant software and hardware to replace systems that are not year compliant 
for our information technology exposures  to date we are complete on the remediation phase and expect to complete reprogramming and replacement no later than mid once the applicable software and hardware is reprogrammed or replaced  we will begin testing and implementation 
these phases run concurrently for different systems 
to date  we have completed of our testing and have implemented of our remedied systems 
completion of the testing phase for all significant systems is expected by mid  with all remedied systems fully tested and implemented with completion targeted for september  we plan to complete our assessment of key vendors  customers and other parties by the end of the first quarter of to assess the impact  if any  on our business operations 
we have not incurred and do not expect to incur significant costs related to year issues other than the time of internal personnel to complete our year plans 
we believe our program will be effective to resolve the year issued in a timely manner 
as noted above  we have not yet completed all phases of the year program 
in the event we do not complete any additional phases  we would be unable to service and invoice customers or collect payments in a timely manner 
in addition  disruptions in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect our business 
we could be subject to litigation for computer systems product failure 
the amount of potential liability and lost revenue cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we have contingency plans for most of our critical applications and are working on such plans for others 
these contingency plans involve  among other actions  manual workarounds and adjusting staffing strategies 
manual workarounds would consist of preparing billings and cash disbursements from hard copy source documents  which are currently maintained by us
