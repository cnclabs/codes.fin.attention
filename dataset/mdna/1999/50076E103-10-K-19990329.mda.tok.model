the company has substantially completed a review of its information technology it systems and non it systems regarding year compliance 
all required changes to mission critical systems found thus far have been completed and successfully tested 
all desktop computer systems and network systems are believed to be year compliant 
at this time  management does not believe that the company is responsible for any computer controlled systems that are vulnerable to the year problem such as hvac  elevators or alarms at any of its properties 
while the company is still in the process of completing this review  all vendors of such systems that are known to us have been contacted 
all of the company s tenants have been notified of the issues regarding the year the company expects to have completed identification  remediation and testing of all of its systems by may of costs for modifications to current it systems have not been separated from ongoing it expenses due to their limited nature 
similarly  no budget has been allocated for future costs due to their minor contribution to ongoing it operations 
there can be no guarantee that the company will identify all it and non it systems that may be vulnerable to year issues prior to january  or february  to the extent that systems are overlooked or remediation measures are themselves subject to error  the company may experience loss of normal operation which could adversely effect the company s operating results and financial condition 
tenants of the company s properties may own or maintain it and non it systems which are not year compliant 
to the extent that such tenants are unable to process payments or otherwise perform business as usual  the company s operating results and financial condition could be adversely effected 
however  all leases will remain in full effect and tenants will remain liable for all amounts due to the company after the change to the year requiring tenants representations of year compliance would have little if any effect on the situation and the company does not intend to pursue this course 
vendors of the company may own or maintain it and non it systems which are not year compliant 
to the extent that such vendors are unable to render critical services  the company s operating results and financial condition could be adversely effected 
in particular  outages of utilities such as gas  electric and phone service could have a severely negative impact on the company s ongoing operations at any of its locations 
the company is in contact with certain vendors regarding the year  but requiring all vendors representations of year compliance would have little if any effect on the situation and the company does not intend to pursue this course 
due to the widely varying potential impacts of the year problem  the company does not believe it is reasonable to assign dollar amounts attendant to the various risks and outcomes at this time 
based on current information  the company does not consider it necessary to develop a formal contingency plan 
ad hoc contingency plans regarding some of the company s it systems are being assembled  and a formal plan will be considered as a part of our ongoing year planning
