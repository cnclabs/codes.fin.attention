prior to december  the company reduced the income tax provision recorded in its financial statements by recording a tax benefit associated with its net deferred tax assets  primarily net operating loss nol carryforwards 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the realizability of these assets  the company placed a valuation allowance against the entire balance of its net deferred tax assets 
as a result  the associated tax benefit was recognized as income was earned  resulting in a significantly lower effective tax rate for all periods reported prior to december in december  the company performed a detailed analysis of the future taxable income levels required for the company to fully realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets 
based on this analysis  the company determined that it was more likely than not that the company would earn sufficient book and taxable income to fully realize the benefit of its net deferred tax assets 
this determination required the company to remove the valuation allowance and recognize the deferred tax benefit of million at december  in its entirety 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will achieve taxable income sufficient to realize the full benefit of its net deferred tax assets 
because  for financial statement purposes  the benefit associated with the company s deferred tax assets has been fully realized  the company s effective tax rate can no longer be reduced by the recognition of this tax benefit over future periods of income generation 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate is substantially larger in fiscal and fiscal than in prior periods 
cash payments for income taxes continue to be reduced by available nol carryforwards
