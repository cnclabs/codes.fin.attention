declines in departmental margins relate primarily to the integration of the holiday inn assets and the single asset acquisitions  which have had historically lower margins 
property tax increases relate to increased valuations as a result of the significant capital improvements for several hotels in the original bristol portfolio as well as an increase in tax rates for certain hotels

recurring diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december   represents a improvement over liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under the million revolving credit facility with bankers trust company the credit facility 
the company had approximately million of cash at spin off and approximately million of cash as of december  the company believes that it currently requires approximately million to million of cash to fund the day to day working capital needs of the company 
the company s cash flows are sensitive to the performance of the leased and managed properties 
for managed properties  the company s cash flows are principally tied to changes in the gross revenues of the properties 
for leased properties  the company is impacted both by changes in gross revenues as well as changes in operating expenses and rent expense 
rent expense is paid principally as a percentage of gross revenues and is largely tied to room revenue volume 
room revenue increases or decreases caused by changes in room rates have only a minor impact on operating expenses  as compared to revenue increases or decreases generated by changes in occupancy  which also can produce significant changes in operating costs 
as a result  the company s cash flows are more directly impacted by revenue increases or decreases caused by changes in average room rates 
increased revenues caused by increases in occupancy levels could have little impact on the company s cash flows or could actually reduce cash flow if the incremental business is not sold at sufficiently high average room rates 
the million of commitments under the credit facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
additionally  a sub limit of up to million of such commitments is available to issue letters of credit to secure the company s obligations under the leases with felcor and other owners  subject to the reduction of such sub limit to reflect the company s achievement of liquid net worth requirements related to such leases 
concurrently with the spin off  a letter of credit for million was issued to felcor to secure the company s obligations under the leases 
this amount may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the liquid net worth requirements described above 
as of december   the letter of credit amount outstanding was million 
as of december   the company had a million promissory note from felcor the felcor note which is due upon five days demand 
the company made partial demand on this note and on february   received million cash against the note 
the remaining million can be used by the company for working capital or other purposes 
the company is actively pursuing opportunities for growth and anticipates adding to its leasehold and management portfolio  both through its relationship with felcor  as well as working with other reits and individual property owners who could benefit from the company s services 
the company began management of the holiday inn in olathe  kansas in september   the hampton inn in sault st 
marie  michigan in march  and has announced agreements to manage two hilton garden inns and a room upscale hilton hotel  all of which are currently under development  for the landmark organization 
the development of these properties will be completed during and it is possible that some new management contracts or leases could require a small capital investment on the part of the company 
the company may also purchase hotel leases or management contracts from third parties 
if such an investment is necessary  the company believes it has adequate capital resources including cash on hand  availability under the credit facility and the felcor note to fund these opportunities for the immediate future 
the company acquired a joint venture interest and the management of the cambridge inn in cambridge  massachusetts in january the company is continuously exploring opportunities for increasing efficiency at the hotels and the corporate office 
some of these opportunities could require small capital investments by the company to achieve the targeted savings 
the company plans to install approximately million of energy saving devices throughout the leased hotels during additionally  the company expects to incur up to million of information technology improvement costs in the company s corporate office in the next fiscal year  primarily related to the development and installation of the company s wide area network which will improve productivity and ease communication between the corporate office and the hotels 
the company believes that it has adequate capital resources to fund its growth opportunities for the immediate future 
seasonality the lodging industry is affected by seasonal patterns 
at most of the company s hotels  demand is higher in the second and third quarters than during the remainder of the year 
the company s results are also impacted during periods of renovation when rooms are placed out of service 
the company expects to have approximately  room nights out of service in in conjunction with the redevelopment and rebranding program  consisting of  in the first quarter   in the second quarter   in the third quarter  and  in the fourth quarter 
inflation the company is impacted by inflation in both the general price movement of certain costs of the operations of its hotels and in the ability to increase the rates charged to its guests for rooms  food and beverage and other services 
many of the costs of operating the hotels can be fixed for certain periods of time  reducing the short term effects of changes in the rate of inflation 
room rates  which are set on a daily basis  can be rapidly changed to meet changes in inflation rates as well as other changing market conditions 
the company believes that given the favorable demand supply balance in the hotel segments in which it operates  increases in inflation from today s relatively low rates will not have an adverse impact on profits generated by the company s hotels 
changes in the rate of inflation could impact the level of short term interest rates 
the company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease in the level of short term interest rates  and  since the company has no floating rate debt currently outstanding  the company does not believe that it has any significant exposure should a rise in market interest rates occur 
year readiness in order to fully comprehend the year problem and how it will impact the company s operations  the company has established a year readiness program the program 
the program contemplates the completion of the following steps awareness  inventory  assessment  planning scheduling  test compliance functionality  replace upgrade  and finally  implementation contingency planning 
as of march  the company has completed the program through the test compliance functionality stage  and has commenced the replace upgrade stage with pilot implementation beginning in march the company expects that the entire program will be completed by the beginning of fourth quarter of during the third quarter of  the company completed its evaluation and technical inventory of the company s corporate office and all of the property level systems which might be impacted by the year problem 
the company has secured the resources and scheduled the remedy of each of those systems that it has identified as having potential year issues 
the company has also established a contingency plan for the centralized computer operating systems  which has been tested and is in a state of readiness 
the company continues to evaluate non information technology systems such as embedded chip mechanical engineering systems  energy management systems  and security systems 
as of march   the company has completed the embedded system inventory at hotels and has not identified any embedded system issues 
this inventory is expected to be completed for the remaining hotels by the end of the first quarter of based on current results and other factors  the company does not anticipate finding any material embedded system issues in critical systems at any of the hotels 
the company is also working closely with its franchisors to ensure readiness 
each of these franchisors indicated to the company that their reservation systems would be year ready by january   however  the company has received no verification that the remediation of these systems has been completed 
the franchisors have indicated to the company that they are establishing contingency plans to address any potential year readiness issues 
the company is continuing to survey its vendors and service providers to determine year readiness 
as of march   the company s primary vendors and service providers have indicated that they will be year compliant  however  there is no assurance that all of the company s vendors and service providers will be ready 
contingency plans the company has established a contingency plan and disaster recovery procedure for the centralized computer operating systems  located in the company s corporate office  which has been tested and which the company believes is in a state of readiness 
the company s franchisors have also provided the hotels with materials identifying contingency plans for major property level system outages and force majeure type events 
non franchised properties are provided this information by the company 
additionally  each franchisor is creating checklists and procedures for their licensed hotels which will address problems arising from year related outages with the franchise specific systems 
the company is also establishing plans and procedures to train and prepare primary staff to address operational and systemic issues arising from the year problem 
the company contemplates that these tools and training will be completed by the beginning of the fourth quarter costs the company is working with felcor and its other owners to remedy the property level non compliant systems identified 
in particular  the company has prepared and presented a budget to felcor  which has been approved  setting out the anticipated costs and timeline for the remedy to make the properties year compliant 
while most of the costs associated with the remedy to the felcor properties will be borne by felcor  it is anticipated that the company will bear approximately  of the cost  including the company s portion of the costs of software  hardware and internal employees dedicated to the program 
for each of its other property owners  the company has presented a capital budget including presentations of year remedy costs 
the third party owners are contractually obligated to bear the full amount of this cost 
other than those specified above  the company is not aware of any additional costs that it will bear to remedy the year problems company wide 
risks the company cannot predict the actual effects to it of the year problem  which depends on numerous factors including whether significant third parties properly and timely remedy the year issue  and whether broad based or systemic failures occur including disruptions in passenger transportation or transportation systems generally  loss of utility and or telecommunications services or failures in financial transactions or payment processing systems such as credit cards  as well as the severity and duration of any such failures 
there can be no assurances that year remediation by third parties will be properly and timely completed  and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on the company  its business and its financial condition 
further  the company may have no option but to remain with a vendor who cannot assure year readiness if an alternative source is not available at commercially reasonable terms 
the company s year readiness program is expected to reduce the level of uncertainty about the year problem
