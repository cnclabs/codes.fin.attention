year issue 
the company is currently evaluating the potential effect of the situation commonly referred to as the year issue  which involves the inability of certain software and hardware systems to properly recognize and process dates for the year and beyond 
the company  with the assistance of outside consultants  has developed and is implementing a plan to evaluate the company s internal systems and material third party relationships 
the company has paid third parties approximately  on year testing  auditing  and modifications or upgrades through december  the costs of year compliance have been and will be expensed as incurred 
additionally  the company expects to spend approximately  on these efforts to complete its year compliance procedures 
the company s internal information technology it systems and non it systems use hardware and software supplied by third party vendors 
the company is currently evaluating year compliance of the third party hardware and software  including obtaining year compliance statements from the vendors 
to date  the company has substantially completed the review of its hardware and software systems 
based on this review  the company does not expect to incur material costs to upgrade or replace its hardware or software systems 
however  the estimates of costs to complete year compliance procedures are based  in part  on compliance statements received from third party vendors of the company s hardware and software systems 
subsequent revisions to these compliance statements by third party vendors could result in revised estimated costs to complete year compliance measures 
the company can not predict whether these revisions  if any  will be material 
the company expects to complete substantially its year readiness preparations by june however  unforeseen circumstances could prevent a timely completion of all necessary year compliance measures 
the company believes that adequate alternatives are available for information processing should necessary upgrades or replacements not occur in a timely manner 
the company s clinical research services  particularly its data management services  will depend on the use of third party software 
the company is obtaining certification of year compliance from the vendors of software used in its services 
any failure or delay of this software to be year compliant could cause a material disruption in the company s business 
the company s contingency plan should this software fail to be year compliant is to seek modifications from the vendors of this software in order for it to be year compliant 
in addition  the company depends on infrastructure services provided by third parties and government agencies eg electricity  phone service  water and transportation 
the failure of one or more of these infrastructure services could cause a material disruption in the company s business 
the company ended all expenditures on year testing of its healthcare provider software products upon the sale of these assets on december  in connection with the sale of the assets of the company s healthcare provider software segment  the company made certain representations regarding year compliance of the company s software products and agreed to indemnify the buyer against losses related to a breach of representations and certain third party claims related to the operation of the assets prior to the sale 
although the company s tests and audits of these software products prior to the asset sale did not indicate any issues with year compliance  if an issue with year compliance by these products were to arise  the company could face claims under its indemnification obligations
