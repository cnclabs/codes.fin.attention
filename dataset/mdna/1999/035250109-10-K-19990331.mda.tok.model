in the month period from march  to december   the company completed nine acquisitions 
the revenues for these entities in the last fiscal year prior to acquisition by anicom totalled approximately million 
of these nine acquisitions  three were completed within the last six months of and have accounted for approximately million or of the acquired revenue 
as the company developed plans to implement the integration of these businesses into the anicom information technology system  it became clear that the capacity of the existing system would be severally strained and that improved efficiencies could be realized by evaluating each of the company s significant business processes 
this realization  along with the need to upgrade the company s systems to year compliance  resulted in management undertaking a significant business reengineering program 
in the fourth quarter  the company implemented a complete reengineering plan  designed to further improve operating efficiencies within the organization by leveraging the capabilities inherent in the new information system and to provide the additional information system capacity to continue the company s integrated growth strategy

to 
the facility expires in june with extensions available at the company s option through june the facility contains certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  current  interest coverage and debt to earnings ratios 
management believes that cash flows from operations and borrowings available under the facility will be sufficient to fund current operations  and its planned integrated growth strategy 
the company does not currently have any significant long term capital requirements that it believes cannot be funded from the sources discussed below 
however  in connection with its acquisition and integrated growth strategy  the company s capital requirements may change based upon various factors  primarily related to the timing of acquisitions and the consideration to be used as purchase price 
the company continues to examine opportunities to raise funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities through private placements or public offerings and to increase its available line of credit 
in connection with the acquisition of texcan cables limited  texcan cables  inc and texcan cables international  inc 
collectively referred to as texcan  the company entered into a new million term facility in september  with a canadian bank canadian bank loan

as of december   anicom had working capital of approximately million as compared to million as of december  at december   amounts outstanding under the facility were approximately million 
in operating activities used million of cash compared to million used during this increase has resulted from the increase in sales and the investment in receivables attributable to contractor and large project business

management is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
year readiness and related risks the year issue is the result of computer programs being unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
a task force has been established by the company that includes information systems  accounting and legal personnel of the company to assess the company s state of readiness and to implement an action plan to correct any deficiencies of the company 
to date  the company has identified the following areas to assess as to year readiness distribution and financial information systems  supplier  third party relationships and customers  and physical facility systems 
for each of these areas  the company has established the following procedures to assess its year readiness a identifying systems potentially susceptible to year compliance issues  b developing and implementing corrective actions and c testing to ensure compliance 
management believes that the company is devoting the necessary resources to identify and resolve any significant year issues in a timely manner 
distribution and financial information systems as part of its integrated growth strategy  anicom completed the implementation of a new information technology system in the fourth quarter of this customized information technology system builds upon the strengths inherent in anicom s previous system while allowing for the reengineering of certain business processes that were necessary to accommodate the significant growth anicom has experienced 
the information system integrates sales  inventory control and purchasing  warehouse management  financial control and internal communications while providing real time monitoring of inventory levels  shipping status and other key operational and financial benchmarks at all of anicom s sales and distribution locations 
in implementing this system  management received written confirmation from vendors that the enterprise system software  hardware and network operating systems included in this information system are year compliant 
testing of these systems has confirmed this conclusion 
total costs incurred to purchase the necessary hardware  software  licenses  consulting services and training associated with the installation  modification and implementation of the system were approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million was expensed with the remainder being capitalized and depreciated over future periods 
the company does not anticipate incurring any material additional costs with respect to year readiness of this information technology system 
since implementing the company s new information technology system  the company has completed certain acquisitions that are in various stages of conversion to the company s current system 
management estimates that  with the exception of texcan s canadian operation  which was acquired in september  all operations will be converted to the company s new information technology system no later than the second quarter of management believes that the portion of the costs for this conversion related to year readiness is not material 
texcan s canadian financial and distribution systems are currently in the process of being upgraded to become year compliant and management estimates this will be completed during the first quarter of at a cost of  to  texcan s canadian systems will be converted to the company s new information technology system subsequent to the second quarter of suppliers  third party relationships and customers the company relies on third party suppliers for inventory  utilities  transportation and other key supplies and services 
interruption of supplier operations due to year issues could adversely affect the company s operations 
the company s payroll outsourcing service has confirmed that the systems used to process the company s payroll are year compliant 
the company has begun evaluating the year readiness of its other suppliers through a survey distributed in the fourth quarter of responses are being evaluated and second requests will be mailed for non responses 
unsatisfactory responses or non responses from critical suppliers will be evaluated on a case by case basis in an attempt to mitigate risk to the company 
these activities are intended to provide a reasonable means of managing risk  but cannot eliminate the potential for disruption due to third party failure 
the company does not currently have any formal information concerning the year readiness of its customers  and given the breadth and diversity of its customer base  the company is making a formal inquiry of selected customers 
the company believes that the impact of isolated occurrences resulting from any of its customers failing to be year compliant would not be materially adverse to the company 
however  widespread interruptions to customers serviced by the company could result in reduced sales  increased inventory or receivable levels and a reduction in cash flow 
the company has not incurred  and does not believe it will incur  material costs related to any inquiry as to the year readiness of its suppliers  other third party relationships and customers 
physical facility systems the company is continuing to evaluate the year readiness of its physical facility systems  such as phone systems  power  security systems  heating  ventilation and air conditioning systems  etc 
the company expects to complete the assessment phase of its physical facility systems during the first and second quarter of with remedial action planned for the second and third quarter of while the company and many other companies believe their efforts to address the year issues will be successful in avoiding any material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition  it recognizes that a most reasonably likely worst case year scenario would involve the failure of a third party or a component of the infrastructure  including national banking systems  electrical power  transportation facilities  communication systems and governmental activities  to conduct their respective operations after such that the company s ability to obtain and distribute its products and services would be limited for a period of time 
if this were to occur  it would likely cause temporary financial losses and an inability to provide products and services to customers  and there may be no practical alternative to some of these resources available to the company 
the company is currently implementing contingency plans to be carried out in the event of an external year failure of vendors that are critical to normal information systems business operations 
management estimates these plans will be complete by the rd quarter of these plans include both internal and external resources and facilities for off site computer processing and personnel relocation in the event of power or data communication failure that results in the inability to utilize an existing company facility 
the foregoing assessment of the impact of the year issue on the company is based on management s estimates at the present time 
the assessment is based upon numerous assumptions as to future events 
there can be no assurance that these estimates and assumptions will provide accurate  and the actual results could differ materially 
to the extent that year issues cause significant delays in sales  increased inventory or receivable levels or cash flow reductions  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected
