item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview although the metals service center industry was faced with multiple challenges during  the company experienced record sales and earnings results  primarily due to the inclusion of sales and earnings of companies acquired by reliance during and the company experienced pricing pressures for most of its products during  however  the company was able to increase its gross margins during this period due to lower costs of those products and superior inventory turnover rates 
the expanded product and geographic diversity obtained through recent acquisitions also contributed to the record results 
in addition  the demand for heat treated aluminum by the aerospace industry  which allowed higher prices to be realized on sales of these products during  continued through most of the company believes its results have been less volatile to the economic trends affecting the industry because its operations are geographically diversified  it has a wide range of products  and its customer base and the industries to which it sells are highly diversified 
reliance s diversification and financial performance have benefited from several significant acquisitions during the reported periods  each of which has been immediately accretive to earnings 
additionally  the company s successful efforts to continue to expand through strategic acquisitions and to increase its efficiencies and physical capacities through capital expenditure programs have enabled it to lessen the impact of regional economic recessions on the overall results of its operations 
management believes that the company is positioned to take full advantage of improved economic environments  while at the same time it is poised to operate efficiently in less favorable economies because of its tight cost controls  high inventory turnover and diversification 
management does not anticipate the same rate of growth in revenues and net income in as in recent years  due to lower selling prices and costs of materials for most of its products  net of the impact of any acquisitions made during recent developments the company completed seven acquisitions during  and has already completed its first acquisition in these acquisitions were financed by a secondary public equity offering completed in  the private placement of million of senior unsecured debt in november and borrowings under a syndicated bank line of credit

the company s capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and material handling and processing equipment 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are generally from internally generated funds from operations and the company s revolving line of credit 
additionally  in october  the company entered into agreements with insurance companies for private placements of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of  which was funded in november the proceeds of the debt were used to refinance the borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility made to fund acquisitions during  and borrowings for general working capital purposes 
the senior notes that were issued in the private placement have maturity dates ranging from to  with an average life of years  and bear interest at an average rate of per annum 
in  the company entered into a syndicated credit facility with a borrowing limit of  with an allowance to use up to  of the line of credit to make acquisitions

in november  the company issued  new shares of its common stock in a public equity offering  resulting in net proceeds of  the proceeds from this offering were used to pay down outstanding bank debt  including the debt incurred to fund the acquisition of ssa  and to fund the acquisition of georgia steel 
at december   the balance of the proceeds was invested in high quality short term investments classified as cash equivalents  which  along with bank debt  was then used to fund the acquisitions of durrett and phoenix metals on january  such sources of liquidity  as discussed above  were sufficient to fund the acquisitions 
the purchase price of the acquisitions made in totaled approximately  see recent developments section for a complete discussion of the acquisitions made in net capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were  for the year 
the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the company anticipates that the funds generated from operations and funds available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet its working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
the purchase of lbi was funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings on the company s line of credit 
on august   the board of directors of the company approved the purchase of up to an additional  shares of the company s outstanding common stock through its stock repurchase plan  for a total of  shares 
the company has purchased a total of  shares of its common stock  at an average purchase price of per share  as of december   all of which are being treated as authorized but unissued shares 
the company repurchased  of those shares during  at an average purchase price of per share 
the company believes such purchases enhance shareholder value and reflect its confidence in the long term growth potential of the company 
inflation the company s operations have not been  nor are they expected to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  the company has been successful in raising prices to its customers in periods of increasing metal prices and has had to reduce prices to its customers in periods of declining metal prices 
changes in metal prices  therefore  affect the company s sales and earnings 
seasonality the company recognizes that some of its customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of the company s geographic  product and customer diversity  however  the company s operations have not shown any material seasonal trends  although the months of november and december traditionally have been less profitable because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of the company s products and holiday closures for some of its customers 
there can be no assurance that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
impact of year the company does not anticipate that there would be a material impact on the results of operations or cash flows of the company related to the company s year issue 
the year issue addresses computer programs which have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year as the company consists of a chain of metals service centers which do not produce a date sensitive product or have highly automated operations  the primary year exposure is related to the business applications software used by the company to perform purchasing  inventory management  process ing  production scheduling  sales order entry and invoicing  routing and shipping  and accounts payable and general ledger accounting 
a majority of the company s locations began converting to new business applications software and related hardware systems to obtain additional functionality in this conversion is substantially complete 
this software has since been certified year compliant by the company s software vendor 
in addition to the vendor s certification  the company has an ongoing program to test its systems for such compliance 
the testing performed by the company has confirmed the vendor s certification 
additionally  certain of the subsidiaries acquired by the company will be converted to this system during  as their current systems are not considered to be year compliant 
at the company s subsidiaries that are not being converted to this system  assessments of the existing systems have occurred  which indicated that certain subsidiaries require minor modifications to their existing software  while other subsidiaries are in the testing or modification phases 
any additional modifications or testing are expected to be completed by august with respect to other equipment used in the company s operations  year certifications are being obtained from vendors and testing is being performed  where practical 
as the company utilizes minimal date dependent processing and delivery equipment in its operations  management does not expect a material impact on the company s operations due to the failure of other equipment in the year the major business systems of the company are not vulnerable to third parties failure to remediate their own year issues  as the company s interface with third parties  including customers and vendors  does not involve heavily automated computer dependent communications 
the company has estimated costs related to the year issue of approximately million  with approximately 
million of these costs expected to be capitalized  as they relate primarily to purchases of software 
as such  the company does not anticipate a material impact on the results of operations or cash flows related to the year issue 
the company has not obtained independent verification to assure the reliability of the year risk and cost estimates 
the company believes that with the conversions to new software and modifications to existing software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer system 
in the event the remaining conversions and modifications are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue is not expected to have a material impact on the operations of the company  as the products sold by the company and the processing and delivery equipment used are not date dependent  minimizing the impact of any year issues related to meeting customer requirements 
in addition  in the worst case scenario  if the business applications software or other equipment fail due to year issues  other locations of the company can fulfill the customer requirements for any failed systems or equipment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations are affected by numerous external factors  such as general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  and steel pricing and availability 
the company is also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from its long term debt issued at a fixed rate 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on the current holdings of debt  the exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be material 
fixed rate debt obligations currently issued by the company are not callable until maturity
