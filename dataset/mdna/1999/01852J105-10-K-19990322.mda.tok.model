asset liability management the company s asset and liability management strategy attempts to minimize the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by changes in the interest rate environment without penalizing current income 
net interest income  the primary source of the company s earnings  is affected by interest rate movements 
to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates  a balance sheet must be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in approximately equivalent amounts at basically the same time intervals 
the company seeks to reduce the volatility of its net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
to accomplish this  the company has attempted to increase the percentage of assets  whose interest rates adjust more frequently  and to reduce the average maturity of such assets 
a focus in recent years  had been the origination of adjustable rate residential real estate loans 
the company currently originates shorter maturity fixed rate commercial real estate loans  home equity lines of credit and consumer loans  which generally mature or reprice more quickly than fixed rate residential real estate loans 
however  adjustable rate loans are nearly as likely to refinance in low interest rate environments as fixed rate loans 
often  interest rate cycles allow for these refinancings before the adjustable rate loans can adjust to fully indexed market rates 
in such declining interest rate environments  that result in high levels of loan refinancings  the company may decide to acquire longer fixed rate mortgage loans or mortgage backed securities 
to provide an acceptable level of interest rate risk  the company utilizes a funding strategy using long term federal home loan bank borrowings 
imbalances in repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute an interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
these static measurements do not reflect the results of any potential activity and are best used as early indicators of potential interest rate exposures 
as part of its asset liability strategy  the company has implemented a policy to maintain its cumulative one year interest sensitivity gap ratio within a range of to of total assets  which reflects the current interest rate environment and allows the company to maintain an acceptable net interest rate spread 
the gap ratio will fluctuate as a result of market conditions and management s expectation of future interest rate trends 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated by the company to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were based upon the contractual terms of the asset or liability or certain assumptions concerning the amortization and prepayment of such assets and liabilities 
savings accounts  now accounts and money market accounts  which collectively totaled million at december   were assumed to be withdrawn at annual percentage rates of  and  respectively 
management believes that these assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  although the actual amortization and repayment of assets and liabilities may vary substantially 
at december  more than more than year year years more than dollars in thousands or less to years to years years total interest earning assets mortgage loans      home equity lines of credit   consumer loans and leases      mortgage backed securities      interest bearing deposits   investment securities      total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities savings accounts      now interest bearing accounts      money market accounts      certificate accounts     borrowed funds      total interest bearing liabilities      interest sensitivity gap      cumulative interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative net interest earning assets as a percentage of interest bearing liabilities for purposes of the gap analysis  mortgage loans  home equity lines of credit and consumer loans and leases are not reduced by the allowance for loan losses and are reduced for non performing loans 
mortgage backed and investment securities are not increased or decreased by unrealized gains losses resulting from the accounting for available for sale securities under sfas no 
see accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
liquidity the company s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities and the sale of loans 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rate cycles and economic conditions 
the bank is required by regulation to maintain specific minimum levels of liquid investments 
regulations currently in effect require the bank to maintain liquid assets at least equal to of the sum of its average daily balance of net withdrawable accounts and short term borrowed funds 
this regulatory requirement may be changed from time to time by the ots to reflect current economic conditions and deposit flows 
the bank s liquidity ratios were and at december  and  respectively 
the company s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which include investments in highly liquid  short term investments and interest bearing deposits 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the company s operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
at december  and  cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million  respectively 
liquidity management for the company is both a daily and long term function of the company s management strategy 
excess funds are generally invested in short term investments such as federal funds and interest bearing deposits 
in the event that the company should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available through the use of fhlb advances 
the company s cash flows are comprised of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
net cash related to operating activities  consisting primarily of interest and dividends received less interest paid on deposits  and the origination and sale of loans  utilized million for the year ended december  and provided million for the year ended december  net cash related to investing activities  consisting primarily of principal collections on loans and mortgage backed securities and proceeds from the sale or maturity of loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities  offset by disbursements for loans originated or purchased for investment  purchases of mortgage backed securities and investment securities  offset by sales of mortgage backed securities available for sale  maturities of investment securities available for sale  principal collections on loans and mortgage backed securities  utilized million for the year ended december  and provided million for the year ended december  net cash related to financing activities  consisting primarily of net activity in deposit and escrow accounts  net proceeds from borrowed funds and the payment of dividends  provided million for the year ended december  and utilized million for the year ended december  at december   the company had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase million loans 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled million 
management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the company 
capital compliance the bank s tangible capital ratio at december   is 
this exceeds the tangible capital requirement of of adjusted assets by million 
the bank s leverage capital ratio at december   is 
this exceeds the leverage capital requirement of of adjusted assets by million 
the bank s risk based capital ratio is at december  the bank currently exceeds the risk based capital requirement of of risk weighted assets by million 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes therein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
year the company has established a year project plan to address systems and facilities changes necessary to properly recognize dates after  has assigned implementation responsibilities  and has established management and board reporting processes 
all of the company s significant financial accounting systems are provided under contract with major national banking systems providers who are progressing under their own year plans 
most significant systems changes have been completed as of december  the company s plan follows the five step approach required by its regulators awareness  assessment  modification  verification  and implementation 
the company s project also addresses its other suppliers  customers  and other constituents  as well as remediation and business resumption contingency plans 
the costs of the project  and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
the primary uncertainty facing the company is the ability of third party systems providers to identify and modify software as planned 
specific factors that might cause material differences from plans include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
additional information about the company s year status at december  was as follows readiness the company s plan includes both information technology it and non it systems 
most of the company s primary year exposures relate to it systems  primarily to the vendor of its account processing systems 
the company utilizes a national third party provider for the bulk of its data processing needs 
as a result  a large part of the company s mission critical year testing is for products and services processed by that service provider 
the service provider has completed the remediation and testing of its system and has had its year compliant systems in production since june  the company is in the process of independently testing its activities on that system to verify that the service provider s system functions in the year for those services used by the company 
in november  the company successfully completed the first phase of that testing and is scheduled to complete testing by the spring of costs the company has not incurred material costs specifically related to its year program and does not expect these costs to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
direct costs of the year issue have been estimated to not exceed  per year for the years ended december   and the primary direct costs include compensation and benefits paid to staff dedicated solely to the year issues  direct costs paid to vendors or others related to year preparedness and the income statement effect of hardware and software purchased to replace items not year compliant 
the figure does not include costs considered by the company to be indirect costs 
the primary indirect cost includes the time and effort of many of the company s employees to prepare for the year in addition to performing their normal work routine 
the costs of the year project are based on the company s best estimates  which include numerous assumptions about future events 
actual costs may differ due to actual events being different than those assumed at the time the cost estimates were prepared 
risks the most significant risk anticipated by the company is the possibility of interruptions to its account processing systems 
due to the progress described above  the company does not presently foresee any material interruptions to these systems 
the next most significant risk relates to interruptions in the payment processing systems  which are integrated with the company s account processing systems 
the company is working with its payment processing vendors  the most significant of which are reported to be making satisfactory progress in complying with federal regulatory guidelines for year readiness 
contingency plans the company has taken actions to comply with federal regulatory requirements for year contingency planning 
the company presently believes that the compliance effort can and will be completed prior to the year however  if required product or service upgrades are not complete by that time  the year issues could disrupt normal business operations 
although not expected at this time  the most likely worst case scenario includes the company being unable to process some or all of its transactions on a temporary basis 
because of the nature of this scenario  the company is in the process of establishing contingency plans for all mission critical services 
those contingency plans will also be tested as part of the company s year preparedness 
additionally  a business resumption plan is being developed to mitigate risks associated with the failure of mission critical systems 
the year business resumption contingency plan will be designed to ensure that mission critical core banking processes will continue if one or more supporting systems fail and to allow for limited transaction processing until the year problems are fixed 
readers should be cautioned that forward looking statements contained in the year disclosure should be read in conjunction with the company s disclosures regarding forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as its primary interest rate risk planning tool  the bank utilizes a market value model prepared by the ots the ots npv model  which is prepared quarterly  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by approximating the bank s net portfolio value npv  which is the net present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and any off balance sheet contracts  under a range of interest rate scenarios  which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates measured in basis point increments 
the bank s asset and liability structure results in a decrease in npv in a rising interest rate scenario and an increase in npv in a declining interest rate scenario 
during periods of rising interest rates  the value of monetary assets declines more rapidly than the value of monetary liabilities rises 
conversely  during periods of falling interest rates  the value of monetary assets rises more rapidly than the value of monetary liabilities declines 
however  the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling interest rate environment ie  the amount of value increase under a specific rate decline may not equal the amount of value decrease under an identical upward interest rate movement 
the following table sets forth the bank s npv at december   as calculated by the ots  based on information provided by the bank to the ots 
change in npv as of economic interest rates net portfolio value value of assets in basis points npv rate shock amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands static  based on the economic value of the bank s assets assuming no change in interest rates 
as shown by the table above  increases in interest rates will result in net decreases in the bank s net portfolio value  while decreases in interest rates will result in smaller net increases in the bank s net portfolio value 
because a basis point increase in interest rates caused less than a decrease in the ratio of npv to the economic value of the bank s assets  the bank is considered by the ots to have minimal interest rate risk 
at december   the bank s board of directors had adopted interest rate risk target limits which established maximum potential decreases in the bank s npv of  and in the event of  and immediate and sustained increases in market interest rates  respectively 
as indicated in the table above  at december   the bank was within such board approved limits 
the bank s target limits are reviewed by the board of directors regularly and are changed in light of market conditions and other factors 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented in the computation of npv
