item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations because of the increasing investment of the company in joint ventures jv or jv s which are not consolidated  but accounted for under the equity method  the following comparative schedule is prepared to clarify and demonstrate the significance of jv operations underlying the consolidated revenue of the company during the periods ending december   and as demonstrated below  the company manages significantly more sales than is reported in consolidated revenue 
amount msi s joint joint venture included in non jv consolidated venture sales net income co s msi revenue revenue revenue vs 
consolidated revenues in increased over  with jv sales decreasing and non jv revenues up  a million increase 
a significant part of the decrease in jv sales was attributable to cyanco s decrease in sales of million or compared to sales 
sales in colombia remained basically unchanged from those of a year earlier 
sales in ghana decreased from those in  but the sales amount is small 
in uzbekistan  sales increased to million representing a fold increase over sales in  thus overcoming to a large degree the decrease in cyanco sales 
the company s share of joint venture net income decreased in from that of by million 
the company s equity earnings from cyanco decreased by million  a decrease of  which is almost entirely due to a decrease in price since production volume remained relatively constant during compared to it is estimated that production volume at cyanco will continue at a similar pace for as that experienced in the combined equity earnings from colombia  uzbekistan and ghana increased by approximately  during over that of however  equity earnings from the joint ventures in colombia  ghana and uzbekistan may decrease in if gold and coal prices decline or continue at current levels 
furthermore  if the current global financial downturn continues  it is likely to affect earnings negatively since there may be currency fluctuations impacting convertibility of currencies and translation accounting negatively impacting the financial statements 
despite the possible flatness to slight decrease in earnings from the current joint ventures projected for  these joint ventures are strategically attractive for the company and will continue to provide steady or increasing returns on assets over a long period of time 
furthermore  the addition of the kovdor joint venture and other direct foreign investments of msi through msic  cac  oda and msir  in developing foreign trading in accessories and raw materials  direct bulk explosive service to mines  royalties  technical fees and financing gains should continue to increase revenues and earnings in over those of the million increase in non jv revenues is largely made up of increased sales in the us and canada aided by sales due to the acquisition of gme in december direct revenues from foreign royalties  technical fees  interest income on foreign loans  accessories trading and direct bulk explosives activities in foreign locations represented approximately of the million of non jv revenue 
it is expected that consolidated non jv revenues will significantly increase in over those of due to the acquisition of gme and the addition of other major us contracts despite the expected winding down of a major dam project in california later in  for which the company supplies explosives 
consolidated income from operations decreased on a percentage basis from to of revenue comparing to the  decrease in income from operations can be summarized as a million decrease in equity earnings from cyanco largely offset by an increase of net contributions and jv earning of million from explosives 
the million increase in net contribution from explosives from to included an increase of net contribution from us and canada operations of approximately  an increase from other foreign related explosives activities of  and an increase from explosives jv s of approximately  this increase of net contribution at the projects level were partially offset during by increases in corporate expenditures in r d of  and other development  general and administrative costs of approximately  raw material costs should be reduced or remain stable during and it is expected that there will be no major supply problems except where imports may be limited by lack of convertibility to hard currency 
income before provision for income taxes for was down by compared to that of the effective tax rate increased from in to in due primarily to the large number of options exercised in and the utilization of certain other one time tax benefits carried over from prior years 
it is expected that during the income tax rate will continue at an effective tax rate in excess of due to the non deductibility of amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of gme 
vs 
consolidated revenues for the company showed a increase between and this was due to the increase of msi s revenue attributable to its share of equity earnings from jv s which increase in was primarily derived from explosives jv s 
cyanco s revenues increased only slightly at over those of net income of  for increased by approximately  or over that earned in pre tax earnings increased from  in to  in which represents a increase 
the effective tax rate in was compared to in year issue management believes the concerns for year issues have been adequately addressed internally during all material systems used in the company  including accounting  manufacturing  facilities and desktop systems  are being converted to be year compliant by the end of management is of the opinion that consequences of year issues will not have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations  or financial condition 
however  no organization  including the company  can control all aspects of achieving and maintaining year compliance 
the company plans to monitor the year compliance of the third parties on which the company may rely 
there can be no guarantee that timely conversion  or that a failure to convert by another company would not have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
management s estimated cost for assessing and reaching year compliance during and should be under  in plants where the processing operations are either controlled or monitored by computerized systems  the company plans on having all operations physically shut down at the end of and then restarted in the new year  thus eliminating any chance of an operational failure due year issues 
liquidity and financial resources the company ended with a very strong financial position 
cash flow from operating activities was  during compared to  during  an improvement of about 
the current ratio  a measure of current liquidity  declined during from at the end of to at the end of long term debt existing at the end of was approximately million made up primarily of debts relating to the acquisition of gme 
deferred taxes were increased from  to  reflecting primarily the increased tax deferral of certain foreign based income and increased differences between book and tax accumulated depreciation 
receivables by the end of had increased  over this increase was due in part to delayed payments of royalties  the consolidation of gme  increased sales in the us  and approximately  from slow paying receivables due from lack of timely convertibility to hard currency in uzbekistan 
it is expected that increases of cash flow from operating activities should continue to increase during net cash used in investing activities increased from  in to  in  primarily due to an increase in investment in joint ventures and the acquisitions of oda and gme 
the increase in investment in joint ventures was primarily due to approximately  of expenditures in the turon msi joint venture and  spent construction of equipment for the kovdor project  offset with excess distributions of earnings from joint ventures 
cash needed for investing activities during likely will continue in north american operations  kovdor and other foreign operations 
it is also anticipated that several announcements will be made during regarding additional joint ventures and business arrangements which will require additional capital 
it is expected that cash needed for investment during will be provided from operations 
the company has a revolving line of credit with its bank in salt lake city  utah in the amount of  bearing interest at the bank s prime rate less and an equipment line of credit of  bearing interest at the bank s prime rate less secured by equipment 
 of the revolving line of credit is available to be used for the increasing demand for letters of credit internationally 
the company owed  on its lines of credit at december  during the revolving line of credit was utilized up to because of inflation associated with third world countries where the company invests  there exists a substantial risk that the value of investments in those jurisdictions may erode 
also  the internal balance of payments and capital shortages in some of those countries  particularly uzbekistan  may temporarily limit the ability to convert local currencies into hard currency necessary for importing raw materials or remitting profits 
management intends to use appropriate transfer pricing  investments in hedges  loans and other credit facilities where practical and available to minimize the risks inherent in doing business in these countries 
the company continues to pursue its policy of investing with government entities or stable international and us companies as its partners to help insure its long term success
