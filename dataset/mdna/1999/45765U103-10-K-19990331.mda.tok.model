the section in this item entitled factors that may affect future results and financial condition discusses these important factors in greater detail 
the company undertakes no obligations to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
overview the company commenced operations in as a direct marketer of hard disk drives and other mass storage products 
in  the company began marketing its own insight brand computers and in and added hardware  software and other name brand computers to its product line 
through  the company based its marketing practices primarily on advertising in computer magazines and the use of inbound toll free telemarketing 
in  the company shifted its marketing strategy to the publication of proprietary catalogs and the use of outbound account executives focused on the business  education and government markets 
during  the company began to de emphasize the sale of insight brand computers and discontinued the sale of insight brand computers in the fourth quarter of although the cost savings from this decision have positively impacted earnings from operations  gross margin has been negatively affected 
the company expects gross margins to continue to decline in primarily due to industry wide pricing pressures and pricing strategies 
during  the company nearly doubled its catalog circulation to generate leads and aggressively tested new lists 
in  the company decreased its catalog circulation because the company used information generated from prior year tests to target mailings to its best customers and increased its focus on penetrating existing accounts by aggressively increasing its outbound sales force 
to that end  the company has hired a number of senior sales managers and account executives and plans to continue to actively increase its account executive base by approximately to  per quarter  during in  insight introduced its graphically rich electronic catalogs and continued to focus on the business  education and government markets  which aggregated approximately of its business in in order to leverage its infrastructure  the company  in  began providing direct marketing services to third parties 
under most of the company s outsourcing arrangements  the company takes title to inventories of products and assumes the risk of collection of accounts receivable in addition to its sales functions 
revenues derived from the sales of such products are included in the company s net sales 
certain other outsourcing arrangements are primarily service based  and the company generally derives net sales from these types of arrangements based on a percentage of the revenue generated from products sold 
accordingly  the rate of the company s net sales growth in future periods may be affected by the mix of outsourcing arrangements which are in place from time to time 
additionally  some of the programs may be more seasonal in nature  as their target customers can have cyclical buying patterns 
outsourcing represented and of the company s net sales in and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  the company expanded into canada 
during  the company entered the united kingdom and germany markets through acquisitions 
sales in these international markets accounted for and of the company s net sales in and  respectively 
generally  pricing in the computer and related products industry is very aggressive 
the company expects pricing pressures to continue and that it will be required to reduce its prices to remain competitive 
such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales costs of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses earnings from operations non operating income expense  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings compared to net sales

selling  general and administrative expenses

the company has increased its unassisted web sales to of sales for from of sales for the company has also significantly increased the percentage of shipments made using their electronic direct ship programs with its suppliers to in from in these enhancements were partially offset by additional costs associated with an increase in the number of account executives  the infrastructure necessary to build up the company s international operations and higher costs incurred in the initial months of new acquisitions to fully integrate operations 
non operating income expense  net 
non operating income expense  net  which consists primarily of interest  increased from  of interest expense  net in to  of interest expense  net in interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under the company s line of credit which have been necessary to finance the company s growth and interest expense associated with the financing of the sales facility in tempe  arizona

income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate was and for the years and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate reflects the implementation of a tax minimization strategy during  changes to the arizona income tax laws and investments made in tax advantaged bonds  but was partially offset by an increase in the company s marginal federal income tax rate 
compared to net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in from million in sales derived from direct marketing increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from deeper account penetration  a greater percentage of business customers  increased emphasis on outbound telemarketing  increased account executive productivity  more effective sales management and an increase in the company s customer base and average order size

the company experienced significant growth in the notebook and desktop computer category which carries a lower gross margin and a significant decline in hard disk drives as a percentage of sales which carries a higher gross margin 
the gross margin on the company s outsourcing business increased as a result of higher gross margin obtained with its revenue based arrangements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in  but decreased as a percent of sales to in from in this decline was attributable to increased economies of scale and the company s continued shift in its marketing strategy  including the reduction in advertising costs as a percent of sales due to the increase in supplier reimbursements from manufacturers and a reduction of more expensive advertising in computer publications 
these decreases were partially offset by additional costs associated with an increase in the number of account executives and losses experienced in the initial months of new outsourcing contracts 
non operating income expense  net 
non operating income expense  net  which consists primarily of interest  changed from  of interest income  net in to  of interest expense  net in interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under the company s line of credit which have been necessary to finance the company s growth

interest income is generated by the company through short term investments  some of which are investment grade tax advantaged bonds 
income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate was and for the years and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate reflects an increase in the company s marginal tax rate  which was partially offset by investments made in tax advantaged bonds 
seasonality and quarterly results the company has historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in its growth of net sales  earnings from operations and net earnings 
however  as the company has increased its percentage of sales from business  education and government markets  the company s quarterly net sales  earnings from operations and net earnings have been less impacted by seasonality 
the company s net sales growth rate  earnings from operations and net earnings as a percentage of net sales could be affected by the mix of outsourcing arrangements which are in place from time to time 
additionally  some of the outsourcing programs can be seasonal in nature  as their target customers can have cyclical buying patterns 
for example  the company obtained a revenue based outsourcing program in which offers high dollar but low margin products primarily sold in the third quarter which increases sales for the quarter but negatively impacts gross margin 
the following table sets forth certain quarterly information for the company s two most recent years quarters ended dec

 net sales      costs of goods sold      gross profit      selling  general and administrative expenses      earnings from operations      non operating income expense  net earnings before income taxes      income tax expense      net earnings      net earnings per share basic diluted sept

the company received million and million  respectively  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
the company used a substantial portion of the net proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under the line of credit and the remainder for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and facilities expansion 
the company s primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements and capital expenditures necessitated by its sales growth 
capital expenditures for and were million and million  respectively  primarily for the continued upgrade of the company s equipment  systems  software and facilities 
in previous years  cash flows from operations generally have been negative due primarily to increases in accounts receivable and inventories necessitated by the sales growth of the company and the continued shift from sales to the home market to sales in the business  education and government markets 
however  the company s net cash provided by operating activities was million for as compared to million used in operating activities for the positive cash flow in is primarily generated by a million increase in accounts payable  million in net earnings and a decrease of million in inventories 
these funds were used to fund a million increase in accounts receivables 
at the year end  the company had a million credit facility with a finance company 
as of december   the company had no long term outstanding balance  and million was available under the line of credit 
in february  the company replaced its credit facility with a new million credit facility with a finance company 
the agreement provides for cash advances outstanding at any one time up to a maximum of million on the line of credit  subject to limitations based upon the company s eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
cash advances bear interest at libor plus 
the credit facility can be used to facilitate the purchases of inventories from certain suppliers and that portion will be classified on the balance sheet as accounts payable 
the credit facility expires in february the line is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the line of credit contains various covenants including the requirement that the company maintain a specified dollar amount of tangible net worth and restrictions on the payment of cash dividends 
the company s future capital requirements include financing the growth of working capital items such as accounts receivable and inventories and the purchases of software enhancements  equipment  furniture and fixtures to accomplish future growth 
the company anticipates that cash flow from operations together with the funds available under its credit facility should be adequate to support the company s presently anticipated cash and working capital requirements through the company s ability to continue funding its planned growth beyond is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s sales during the past three years

factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future results and financial condition are dependent on the company s ability to continue to successfully market  sell and distribute computers  hardware and software 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include  without limitation  the factors discussed below 
fluctuations in operating results 
the company s results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  the condition of the computer and related products industry  shifts in demand for or availability of computer and related products and industry announcements of new products  upgrades or methods of distribution 
sales can be dependent on specific product categories  and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of the company s sales 
the company s operating results are also highly dependent upon its level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales which fluctuates due to numerous factors including opportunities to increase market share  the availability of opportunistic purchases  changes in prices from suppliers  reductions in the amount of supplier reimbursements that are made available  general competitive conditions and the relative mix of products sold during the period 
the company expects gross margins to continue to decline in primarily due to industry wide pricing pressures and pricing strategies 
in addition  the company s expense levels are based  in part  on anticipated sales 
therefore  the company may not be able to control spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall 
as a result  quarterly period to period comparisons of the company s financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
highly competitive industry 
the computer and related products industry is highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on product availability  price  speed of delivery  credit availability  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and breadth of product lines 
the company expects competition to increase as retailers and direct marketers who have not traditionally sold computers and related products enter the industry and if the industry s rate of growth in the united states slows 
the company competes with a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of computers and related products  including traditional computer and related products retailers  computer superstores  internet only computer providers  consumer electronics and office supply superstores  mass merchandisers and national direct marketers including value added resellers and specialty retailers  aggregators  distributors  franchisers  manufacturers and national computer retailers some of which have commenced their own direct marketing operations 
certain of the company s competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  many of these competitors offer a wider range of products and services than the company and may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition  engage in more extensive promotional activities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by the company will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the computer and related products industry is undergoing significant change 
the company believes that consumers have become more accepting of large volume  cost effective channels of distribution such as computer superstores  internet only computer providers  consumer electronic and office supply superstores  national direct marketers and mass merchandisers 
product resellers and direct marketers are combining operations or acquiring or merging with other resellers and direct marketers to increase efficiency 
moreover  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and services 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
generally  pricing is very aggressive in the industry and the company expects pricing pressures to continue 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher sales  cost reductions or otherwise 
such pricing pressures could result in an erosion of the company s market share  reduced sales and reduced operating margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company expects gross margins to continue to decline in primarily due to industry wide pricing pressures and pricing strategies 
managing rapid growth  no assurance of additional financing 
since its inception  the company has experienced substantial changes in and expansion of its business and operations 
the company s past expansion has placed  and any future expansion would place  significant demands on the company s administrative  operational  financial and other resources 
the company s operating expenses and staffing levels have increased and are expected to increase substantially in the future 
in particular  the company has hired a significant number of additional personnel  including internationally focused personnel  senior sales managers  account executives and other persons with experience in both the computer and direct marketing industries  and there can be no assurance that such persons will perform to the company s expectations 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract  assimilate and retain additional highly qualified persons in the future 
in addition  the company expects that any future expansion will continue to challenge the company s ability to hire  train  motivate and manage its employees 
the company also expects over time to expend considerable resources to expand convert its information system and to implement a variety of new systems and procedures 
if the company s sales do not increase in proportion to its operating expenses  the company s information systems do not expand to meet increasing demands  or the company fails to attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel or otherwise fails to manage its expansion effectively  there would be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve its growth strategy 
historically  cash flow from operations has been insufficient to finance the company s growth  and the company has relied upon a line of credit and proceeds from its public offerings to finance working capital requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company s operations will generate sufficient cash flow or that adequate financing will be available to finance continued growth 
risks associated with past and future acquisitions  international operations 
the company has completed three acquisitions during additionally  the company will seek to acquire additional businesses to expand or complement its operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  the company s financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
there is no assurance that the company will identify acquisition candidates that would result in successful combinations or that any such acquisitions will be consummated on acceptable terms 
any future acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and amortization of expenses related to goodwill and intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect the company s profitability 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of operations of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has had no or only limited direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  all of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company recently opened an operation in canada and completed acquisitions in europe as part of its effort to penetrate international markets 
in implementing this strategy  the company faces barriers to entry and the risk of competition from local and other companies that already have established global businesses as well as the risks generally associated with conducting business internationally  including exposure to currency fluctuations  limitations on foreign investment and the additional expense and risks inherent in operating in geographically and culturally diverse locations 
because the company may continue to develop its international business through acquisitions  the company may also be subject to risks associated with such acquisitions  including those relating to the marriage of different corporate cultures and shared decision making 
there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in increasing its international business  if at all  in a profitable manner 
business interruption  reliance on management information systems 
the company believes that its success to date has been  and future results of operations will be  dependent in large part upon its ability to provide prompt and efficient service to customers 
in addition  the company s success is largely dependent on the accuracy  quality and utilization of the information generated by its management information systems  which affect its ability to manage its sales  accounting  inventory and distribution systems 
the company began in a major information system upgrade to replace its core business function applications which will continue in and beyond 
although the company has redundant systems  with full data backup  a substantial interruption in the information system or in the company s telephone communication systems would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with year problem 
many of the world s computer systems currently record years in a two digit format 
such computer systems will be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  which could lead to business disruptions 
the potential costs and uncertainties associated with this issue will depend on a number of factors  including software  hardware and the nature of the industry in which a company operates 
additionally  companies must coordinate with other entities with which they electronically interact  such as customers  vendors and lenders 
the company has commenced  but not completed  an assessment of its year issues with respect to both information technology it systems and non it systems 
the company expects to complete its assessment at the beginning of the second quarter of the company s year plan also includes remediation  testing and contingency planning phases 
during the middle of  the company plans to complete all testing and remediation and put into production all modifications to achieve year compliance 
the company s year plan also includes contingency planning to be completed during the third and fourth quarters of the company is modifying its existing core business functions applications to be year compliant 
the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software  the cost of which is not expected to be material  the year problem will not pose significant operational problems for the company s internal operations 
to date  the company s assessment of non it systems  such as its buildings and equipment  has not revealed any material year issues  assuming no disruption in telephone  electric services and delivery 
additionally  the company is in the process of replacing its core business function applications in order to accommodate its expanding business needs 
these applications are believed to be year compliant software  purchased with such certification from the source vendor 
certain of these applications are scheduled to be installed during the second quarter of at which point the company will proceed to the testing phase 
as part of the company s year assessment  it is continuing to verify the year readiness of third parties vendors  customers and lenders with whom the company has material relationships 
at present  the company is not able to determine the effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition in the event the company s material vendors  customers and lenders are not year compliant 
in a worst case scenario  possible consequences include loss of communications links  loss of electric power and inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities resulting in the inability to sell and deliver products to customers 
in addition  since not all customer situations can be anticipated  the company may experience sales returns of merchandise  although such returns should not materially affect the company s financial condition 
the company will continue to monitor the progress of its material vendors  customers and lenders and formulate a contingency plan at that point in time when the company does not believe a material vendor  customer or lender will be compliant 
the company s internal contingency planning is not yet complete and will be reviewed regularly until year actually begins 
possible nonrenewal or cancellation of outsourcing arrangements 
the company performs outsourcing services for certain manufacturers pursuant to various arrangements 
these parties may cancel such arrangements on relatively short notice or fail to renew them upon expiration 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to replace any manufacturers that terminate or fail to renew their relationships with the company 
the failure to maintain such arrangements or the inability to enter into new ones could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
changing methods of distribution 
the manner in which computers and related products are distributed and sold is changing  and new methods of distribution and sale  such as on line shopping services via the internet  have emerged 
hardware and software manufacturers have sold  and may intensify their efforts to sell  their products directly to end users 
from time to time  certain manufacturers have instituted programs for the direct sales of large order quantities of hardware and software to certain major corporate accounts 
these types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various manufacturers 
in addition  manufacturers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically to end users 
an increase in the volume of products sold through or used by consumers of any of these competitive programs or distributed electronically to end users could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
reliance on suppliers  allocation of goods 
the company acquires products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly through distributors 
purchases from ingram micro  inc  a distributor of computers and related products  accounted for approximately of the company s aggregate purchases for no other supplier accounted for more than of purchases in however  the top five suppliers as a group accounted for approximately of the company s product purchases during the loss of ingram micro  inc or any other supplier could cause a short term disruption in the availability of products 
certain of the products offered from time to time by the company are subject to manufacturer allocation which limits the number of units of such products available to resellers  including the company 
the inability of the company to obtain a sufficient quantity of products  in particular  high demand products such as desktops and notebooks  or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way which favors one of the company s competitors relative to the company could cause the company to be unable to fill customers orders in a timely manner  or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain suppliers provide the company with substantial incentives in the form of payment discounts  supplier reimbursements  price protections and rebates 
supplier funds are used to offset  among other things  cost of goods sold  marketing costs and other operating expenses 
the company competes with other market competitors for these funds 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to receive such incentives or that it will be able to collect outstanding amounts relating to these incentives in a timely manner or at all 
a reduction in or discontinuance of  a significant delay in receiving or the inability to collect such incentives could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
rapid changes in product standards and risk of inventory obsolescence 
the computer and related products industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and product enhancements which can decrease demand for current products or render them obsolete 
in addition  in order to satisfy customer demand and to obtain greater purchasing discounts  the company may carry increased inventory levels of certain products in the future 
the company can have limited or no return privileges with respect to certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to avoid losses related to inventory obsolescence 
state sales or use tax collection 
the company presently collects sales tax only in states that the entity shipping the products has a presence 
the states include arizona  louisiana and indiana 
various states have sought to impose on direct marketers the burden of collecting state sales or use taxes on the sales of products shipped to that state s residents 
the united states supreme court has affirmed its position that under the commerce clause of the united states constitution  a state cannot constitutionally impose sales or use tax collection obligations on an out of state mail order company whose only contacts with the state are the distribution of catalogs and other advertising materials through the mail and the subsequent delivery of purchased goods by united states mail or by interstate common carrier 
if the supreme court changes its position or if legislation is passed to overturn the supreme court s decision  the imposition of a sales or use tax collection obligation on the company in states to which it ships products would result in additional administrative expenses to the company  could result in price increases to the customer or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time  legislation to overturn this decision of the supreme court has been introduced  although to date no such legislation has been passed 
the company also collects a value added tax in canada  the united kingdom and germany 
risk of increasing marketing  postage and shipping costs 
the company mails catalogs through the united states postal service and international services  generates sales leads through marketing and ships products to customers by commercial delivery services 
shipping  postage and paper costs are significant expenses in the operation of the company s business 
historically  the company has experienced increases in postage and paper costs 
there can be no assurance that any such increases can be recouped through an increase in vendor supported advertising rates or that the company will be able to offset future increased costs 
the inability to pass on these increased costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company ships primarily through federal express r  and labor disputes or other service interruptions with federal express  the us postal service or other commercial carriers could have an adverse effect on the company s operating costs and ability to deliver products on a timely basis 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel  including eric j 
crown  chief executive officer  timothy a 
crown  president  and other key employees 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company believes that its future success will be largely dependent on its continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management  sales and technical personnel  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain such personnel 
further  the company makes a significant investment in the training of its sales account executives 
the inability of the company to retain such personnel or to train them rapidly enough to meet its expanding needs could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of its sales staff  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has interest rate exposure arising from the company s line of credit which has a variable interest rate 
this variable interest rate is impacted by changes in short term interest rates 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its conservative debt ratio target and its mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   the fair value of the company s long term debt approximated carrying value 
the company also has foreign currency translation exposure arising from the company s purchase and operating of foreign entities 
the company monitors its foreign currency exposure and may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to manage this exposure
