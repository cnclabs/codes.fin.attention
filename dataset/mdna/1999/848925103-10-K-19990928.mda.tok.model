the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by items included in or derived from sport haley s statements of income  as restated in fiscal years and to account for the discontinuation of the headwear operations fiscal year ended june  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest and other  net income before minority interest and provision for income taxes minority interest 
income taxes income loss from discontinued operations 

net income comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for the year ended june  fiscal were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  or  as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
this decrease was due primarily to slower sales to golf professional shops  many of which had larger remaining inventory than in prior years 
sport haley s slower sales comport with published reports which have indicated that the golf industry in general has experienced a slow down in sales in both equipment and apparel 
another factor which contributed to the decrease during fiscal was sales of approximately million in excess inventory and prior season inventory at wholesale prices consistent with disposal of excess inventory 
corporate sales increases were offset by the reduction in sales in the headwear line 
the men s and women s lines accounted for approximately and  respectively  of total net sales  the elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales and the headwear line accounted for approximately 
the remaining was comprised of embroidery  shipping and the factory outlet store sales  which sport haley has used to sell close out inventory and discontinued styles at discounted retail prices 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased significantly  from to  primarily due to inventory adjustments of approximately million and approximately  in cost of goods sold by the subsidiary 
this significant percentage increase in cost of goods sold resulted in a corresponding decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit decreased by approximately million or  from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal management believes the slowdown in sales in the golf industry created excess inventory for several manufacturers of golf apparel and that many of them also disposed of excess inventory at discounted prices 
management is implementing procedures to identify and resolve inventory issues on a more timely basis and to reduce the cost of goods sold by the subsidiary 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately million  a decrease of approximately  or approximately  compared to million for fiscal although advertising expenses increased by  almost all other expenses in this area were reduced 
management implemented certain cost containment measures during the fiscal year  including a reduction in the number of employees resulting in a reduction of salaries and related payroll expenses 
another factor was less commissions paid to the independent sales representatives on lower sales made by them 
total commissions as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease in percentage reflects more corporate sales and sales of excess inventory where no commissions are paid 
although the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal  those expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  due to lower net sales 
net other income and expenses increased from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal although the use of a significant amount of cash funds used to repurchase common stock reduced investment income in fiscal  other expenses of approximately  in fiscal  including a write down of approximately  in marketable securities  were reduced to approximately  in fiscal income from operations before minority interest and provision for income taxes of approximately million in fiscal decreased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal in fiscal  sport haley acquired a interest in one of its cutting and sewing contractors 
the minority interest benefit of approximately  in and  in were included in income from operations 
although the approximately  provision for income taxes in fiscal was only half of the approximately million in fiscal  the effective tax rate increased significantly from in fiscal to in fiscal the tax rates in any fiscal year can vary significantly due to deductions recognized for tax purposes but not recorded for financial statement purposes  or deductions recorded for financial statement purposes but not recognized for tax purposes 
examples are accounting for stock option compensation  timing differences and the ability to utilize losses for tax purposes 
the result of including the minority interest benefit and deducting the provision for income taxes resulted in income from continuing operations of million in fiscal and million in fiscal a loss  net of income tax benefits  of approximately  in fiscal from discontinued operations of the headwear line further reduced net income for fiscal the discontinued operations resulted in income  net of income tax provision  of approximately  in fiscal net income decreased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  or 
this decrease can be attributed to all of the factors discussed above  but it resulted primarily from reduced sales volume and reduced gross margins 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and as reclassified for to conform to the current year presentation with discontinued operations  net sales for fiscal were approximately million  an increase of approximately million  or  as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
this increase was due to many of the same factors which have contributed to increases in prior years  including a greater number of products offered within each line  greater sales volume  greater market penetration  and higher sales per account 
another factor which contributed to the increase during fiscal was growth in the elements line 
the men s and women s line accounted for approximately and  respectively  of total net sales  and the elements line accounted for approximately of total net sales 
the headwear line which has now been discontinued accounted for the remaining approximately 
although net sales increased  growth was slower than it has been historically 
management believes that sales growth was negatively impacted by canceled sales orders and increased returns and allowance costs  primarily resulting from late shipments during the ups strike 
management also believes that inclement weather attributed to el nino dampened sales in fiscal to many of its golf professional shops in california  north and south carolina  florida and arizona 
gross profit increased by approximately  or  from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal increased sales was the primary factor contributing to this increase 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased slightly due to certain overhead costs which must be included in cost of goods sold and higher shipping costs during the ups strike 
this percentage increase in cost of goods sold resulted in a corresponding slight decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were approximately million  an increase of approximately  or approximately  compared to million for fiscal as in prior years  factors contributing to the increase included commissions to independent sales representatives on higher sales levels and increased marketing expenditures 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased only slightly as a percentage of net sales  from in fiscal to in fiscal net other income and expenses decreased from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal  resulting primarily from a decrease in investment income  a write down of a security and no tax refund as in the prior year 
income before minority interest and provision for income taxes of approximately million in fiscal decreased by approximately  in fiscal  sport haley acquired a interest in one of its cutting and sewing contractors which resulted in a small minority interest benefit 
provision for income taxes decreased approximately  from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal with the effective tax rate for fiscal being and for fiscal being 
the decrease in the tax rate in fiscal was because of a higher deduction for stock option compensation recognized for tax purposes but not recorded on the books for financial statement purposes 
the discontinued operations of the headwear line resulted in a loss of approximately  in fiscal when the line was introduced and income of approximately  in fiscal  the first full year s sales of the headwear line 
net income increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  an increase of approximately 
this increase can be attributed to the factors discussed above  and resulted primarily from increases in sales volume  control of the cost of goods and corresponding margins  control of operating expenditures and a decrease in income taxes 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net sales for the year ended june  fiscal were million  an increase of million  or approximately  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal 
this increase was due to many of the same factors which have contributed to increases in the prior years  including a greater number of products offered within each line  greater market penetration  and higher sales per account 
other factors which contributed to the increase during fiscal were a full year s sales of the elements line and the opening of the factory outlet store 
the men s and women s line accounted for approximately and  respectively  of total net sales 
men s line and women s line sales increased and  respectively  in fiscal over fiscal gross profit increased by million  or approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily a result of the same factors as in prior years  which were a combination of increased sales  volume purchasing of raw materials and better pricing from outside cutting and sewing contractors 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased slightly due to an increase in certain design costs and due to changes in the product sales mix  as the various lines have different margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or approximately  compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to payroll costs associated with the additional personnel required to handle increased sales volume and operation of the factory outlet store 
in addition  as in prior years  other factors contributing to the increase included commissions to independent sales representatives on higher sales levels and increased advertising and marketing expenditures 
and finally  sport haley incurred lease expense for the factory outlet store 
however  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal net other income and expenses increased slightly due primarily to an increase in interest earned on invested funds and an income tax refund  offset by expenditures to repurchase non qualified stock options 
income before provision for income taxes increased million  or approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal provision for income taxes increased approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal income taxes for both of these fiscal years were affected by certain income tax timing differences between book and taxable income 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was and for fiscal was 
sport haley introduced the headwear line in fiscal and discontinued that line effective june  accordingly  the financial statements reflect a loss of approximately  on the discontinued operations in net income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of
