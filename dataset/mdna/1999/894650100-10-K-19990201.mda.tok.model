cash used by discontinued operations of million was due to the recapture of tax deductions previously taken on the umwa fund liability  partially offset by reimbursements received from the umwa fund 
higher capital expenditures in are related to a new facility near budapest  hungary  which will produce disposable films for hygiene products marketed in eastern europe this facility should be operational in mid machinery and equipment purchased for the manufacture of breathable and elastomeric films these films are replacing conventional diaper backsheet and other diaper components in order to improve comfort and fit expansion of diaper backsheet film capacity in brazil the second phase of a modernization program at the aluminum extrusion plant in newnan  georgia the first phase was completed in expansion of molecumetics research lab in bellevue  washington 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities in excess of capital expenditures and dividends was million in  up from million in due primarily to improved operating results lower capital expenditures in aluminum extrusions due to the completion of the modernization project at the newnan plant in late lower capital expenditures due to the molded products and brudi divestitures molded products and brudi had combined capital expenditures of million in these items were partially offset in by income taxes paid on technology related net investment gains higher capital expenditures in film products reflecting normal replace ment of machinery and equipment and permeable film additions  including expansion into china and eastern europe

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tredegar has exposure to the volatility of polyethylene resin prices  aluminum ingot and scrap prices  foreign currencies  emerging markets and technology stocks 
at december   and during the last several years  we have been in a net cash position cash and cash equivalents in excess of debt  and therefore our earnings have not been materially affected by interest rate volatility 
see note on page for information on debt and credit agreements 
changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products  however  those changes are generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices but are also generally followed by a corresponding change in selling prices  however  there is no assurance that higher ingot costs can be passed along to customers 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries

we attempt to match the pricing and cost of our products in the same currency and generally view the volatility of foreign currencies and emerging markets  and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flow  as part of the overall risk of operating in a global environment 
exports from the us are denominated in us dollars 
our foreign operations in emerging markets have agreements with certain customers that index the pricing of our products to the us dollar or the german mark and the euro 
our foreign currency exposure on income from foreign operations in europe primarily relates to the german mark and the euro 
we believe that our exposure to the canadian dollar has been substantially neutralized by us dollar based spread the difference between selling prices and aluminum costs generated from canadian casting operations and exports from canada to the us we have investments in private venture capital fund limited partnerships and early stage technology companies  including the stock of privately held companies and the restricted and unrestricted stock of companies that have recently registered shares in initial public offerings 
investments in non public companies are illiquid and the investments in public companies are subject to the volatility of equity markets and technology stocks

year information technology issues the century date compliance problem  which is commonly referred to as the year problem  will affect many computers and other electronic devices that are not programmed to properly recognize dates starting with january  this could result in system failures or miscalculations 
the potential impact of such failures include  among others  an inability to secure raw materials  manufacture products  ship products and be paid for products on a timely basis 
since  we have been actively planning and responding to the year problem 
year reviews have been and will continue to be made to our executive committee and senior management 
periodic reviews with the board of directors began in august our year compliance efforts are focused on internal computer based information systems  external electronic interfaces and communication equipment  shop floor machines and other manufacturing and research process control devices 
remediation of systems requiring changes was completed at the end of  except for revisions to a small portion of certain software programs and the replacement of certain software for the four aluminum extrusion plants recently acquired in canada see note on page 
remediation efforts for the exceptions will extend into testing of systems began in mid and will continue through we do not believe contingency plans are necessary for internal systems at this time 
we are also actively evaluating the year capabilities of parties with whom we have key business relationships suppliers  customers and banks  for example 
contingency plans will be developed for these relationships as needed 
work to fix the year problem is being performed largely by internal personnel and we do not track those costs 
the incremental costs associated with correcting the problem are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition or cash flows 
while we believe that we are taking the necessary steps to resolve our year issues in a timely manner  there can be no assurance that there will be no year problems 
if any such problems occur  we will work to solve them as quickly as possible 
at present  we do not expect that any such problems will have a material adverse effect on our businesses 
the failure  however  of a major customer or supplier to be year compliant could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board has issued a new standard affecting the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard is not expected to significantly change our operating results  financial condition or disclosures 
the new standard will be adopted in the first quarter of business segment review film products sales 
film products sales decreased by to million in due to lower selling prices reflecting lower average plastic resin costs and lower volume of plastic film in asia primarily supplied to p g  partially offset by sales of breathable backsheet and other new products to p g higher volume of vispore r film primarily used for ground cover applications higher volume of permeable film supplied to p g in europe higher sales to new customers film products sales were almost million in  up from million in due to higher volume of nonwoven film laminates supplied to p g for diapers higher volume of permeable film supplied to p g in europe higher diaper backsheet and packaging film volume in south america higher selling prices  which reflected higher average plastic resin costs operating profit 
film products operating profit was million in  up from million in due to higher volume in the areas noted above and material efficiencies in nonwoven film laminates  partially offset by lower volume and operating profits relating to asia profits down million higher costs related to new product introductions start up costs for the new permeable film production sites in china and hungary film products operating profit was million in  up from million in due mainly to improved production efficiencies for nonwoven film laminates and higher volume in the areas noted in the sales discussion above 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher new product development expenses and start up costs for the new permeable film production site in china
