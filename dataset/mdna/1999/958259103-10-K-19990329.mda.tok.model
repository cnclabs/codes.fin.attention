during the year ended december   the company s marketing margins were reduced by approximately compared to included in the sale of gas and product purchases for the last half of  is the sale of approximately bcf of gas  previously stored in the katy facility  at a margin of approximately 
per mcf 
business strategy the company s long term  four part business plan is designed to increase profitability through i investing in projects that complement and extend its core gas gathering  processing  production and marketing business  ii creating ventures with producers who dedicate additional acreage to the company  iii maintaining or expanding its energy sales volumes and margins by maximizing its asset base  firm transportation and storage contracts and other contractual arrangements  and iv optimizing the profitability of existing operations and in certain cases  considering the disposal of non growth assets 
historically  crude oil prices have been volatile and the oil and gas industry is currently experiencing ten year lows in these prices 
as of march  such prices had declined to approximately per barrel 
most ngl value is tied closely to crude oil  accordingly this pricing environment is having a detrimental effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s plan provides for the improvement of the balance sheet and liquidity while ensuring the continued development of its two primary growth projects  the powder river basin coal bed methane and southwest wyoming operations 
in order to reduce the company s overall debt level and provide it with additional liquidity  the company has signed agreements in march providing for the sale of its giddings gathering system and katy facility for total proceeds of approximately million 
these transactions will result in an after tax loss in of approximately million and are expected to close in the second quarter of  subject to various regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of certain contractual conditions 
expansion of core business the company will continue to evaluate investments in projects that meet its objectives of complementing existing operations  expanding into new areas or providing enhanced marketing opportunities 
these projects typically include gas gathering  treating  processing  producing properties  transportation or storage assets and ngl product upgrade equipment 
in  the company s capital expenditures will be reduced compared to levels expended in and  and will be concentrated on the powder river basin coal bed methane and southwest wyoming operations 
expenditures on these projects are anticipated to comprise and  respectively  of the total budget 
see further discussion in business and properties significant acquisitions  projects and dispositions 
increase dedicated acreage the company enters into agreements which provide it with new dedicated acreage and wells to replace declines in reserves and generate additional volumes for gathering and processing at its facilities 
the company has increased its participation in exploration and production activities 
over the past several years  the company has attempted to structure its contracts to minimize the impact of fluctuating ngl prices 
this has been accomplished by entering fee based contracts and minimizing the use of keep whole contracts

maintain or expand energy marketing services and volumes the company is a full service marketer of gas and ngl products 
the company focuses on the individual needs of its customers  primarily in the rocky mountain region  and is committed to developing products and services that are tailored to meet their requirements 
the company plans to maintain or expand its energy marketing activities by i maximizing profitability on volumes produced at the company s facilities  ii efficient use of various firm transportation and storage contracts and other contractual arrangements to increase profitability while limiting carrying risk  iii continuing to pursue higher margin  end use markets  primarily in the rocky mountain region  and iv maintaining third party gas and ngl sales volumes 
the company believes it competes effectively with other marketers due to its national marketing presence and the marketing information gained thereby  the services it provides and its physical asset base 
optimize profitability the company seeks to optimize the profitability of its operations by i maintaining or increasing natural gas throughput levels  ii increasing its efficiency through the consolidation of existing facilities  iii investing in assets that enhance ngl value  iv selling non growth assets  and v controlling operating and overhead expenses 
in order to maximize its competitive advantages  the company continually monitors the economic performance of each of its operating facilities to ensure that a desired cash flow objective and operating efficiency is achieved 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under its financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet its needs and finance the growth of the company s business 
the company can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects  and it may be required to seek alternative financing sources 
in  sources of liquidity also included the sale of the perkins facility and the edgewood facility and related production 
additionally  the company entered into agreements in march for the sale of the giddings facility and the katy facility for amounts approximating million in gross proceeds 
these transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of  subject to various regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of certain contractual conditions 
the net proceeds from these sales will be used to reduce debt 
net cash provided by operating activities is primarily affected by product prices  sales of inventory  the company s success in increasing the number and efficiency of its facilities and the volumes of natural gas processed by such facilities  the margin on third party product purchased for resale  as well as the timely collection of the company s receivables 
the company s future growth will be dependent upon obtaining additions to dedicated plant reserves  acquisitions  new project development  marketing  efficient operation of its facilities and its ability to obtain financing at favorable terms 
given the depressed oil and ngl prices the company has been experiencing and the disappointing results from the bethel treating facility  the company sought and has successfully negotiated amendments to certain covenant requirements in its various financing facilities and has negotiated amendments to these financing facilities which are intended to provide more flexibility in a low price environment 
there can be no assurance that further amendments or waivers can be obtained in the future  if necessary  or that the terms would be favorable to the company 
to strengthen credit ratings and to reduce its overall debt outstanding  the company will continue to dispose of non strategic assets such as the giddings and katy facilities and investigate alternative financing sources including project financing  joint ventures  public debt and operating leases 
the company believes that the amounts available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with net cash provided by operating activities and the sale of non strategic assets  will provide it with sufficient funds to connect new reserves  maintain its existing facilities and complete its current capital expenditure program 
depending on the timing and the amount of the company s future projects  it may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
the company s ability to secure such capital is restricted by its financing facilities  although it may request additional borrowing capacity from its lenders  seek waivers from its lenders to permit it to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement financing facilities from other lenders  use stock as a currency for an acquisition  sell existing assets or a combination of such alternatives 
while the company believes that it would be able to secure additional financing  if required  no assurance can be given that it will be able to do so or as to the terms of any such financing 
despite the current depressed oil prices  the company also believes that cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet its debt service and preferred stock dividend requirements for the remainder of the company s sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  are summarized as follows s sources of funds borrowings on revolving credit facility  proceeds from the dispositions of property and equipment 
 proceeds from exercise of common stock options total sources of funds  uses of funds payments related to long term debt agreements  capital expenditures  net cash used in operating activities  dividends paid  total uses of funds  additional sources of liquidity available to the company are its inventories of gas and ngls in storage facilities 
the company stores gas and ngls primarily to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and for resale during periods when prices are favorable 
the company held gas in storage and held imbalances of approximately bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december   at various storage facilities  including the katy facility 
at december   the company had hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales of approximately bcf of stored gas at a weighted average price of per mcf for the stored inventory 
see item and business and properties significant acquistions  projects and dispostions katy 
the company held ngls in storage of  mgal  consisting primarily of propane and normal butane  at an average cost of 
per gallon and  mgal at an average cost of 
per gallon at december  and  respectively  at various third party storage facilities 
at december   the company had no significant hedging contracts in place for anticipated sales of stored ngls 
historically  while certain individual plants have experienced declines in dedicated reserves  the company has been successful in connecting additional reserves to more than offset the natural declines 
there has been a reduction in drilling activity  primarily in basins that produce oil and casinghead gas  from levels that existed in prior years 
however  higher gas prices in and  improved technology eg  d seismic and horizontal drilling and increased pipeline capacity from the rocky mountain region have stimulated drilling in the powder river basin and southwest wyoming 
company wide  the level of drilling will depend upon  among other factors  the prices for gas and oil  the drilling budgets of third party producers  the energy policy of the federal government and the availability of foreign oil and gas  none of which are within the company s control 
there is no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in replacing the dedicated reserves processed at its facilities 
in  including the reserves associated with the company s joint ventures and partnerships and excluding the facilities sold during the year  the company connected new reserves to its facilites to replace approximately of production 
on a company wide basis  primarily as a result of the sale of the edgewood and perkins facilities and a downward revision in the reserves associated with the bethel facility  dedicated reserves decreased from approximately tcf as of december  to approximately tcf at december  the company has effective shelf registration statements filed with the securities and exchange commission for an aggregate of million of debt securities and preferred stock along with the shares of common stock  if any  into which such securities are convertible and million of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock

for the year ended december   the company s expenditures consisted of the following i million for new connects  system expansions  the bethel treating facility and asset consolidations  ii million for maintaining existing facilities  iii million for exploration and production activities and acquisitions  and iv million of miscellaneous expenditures 
largely as a result of low commodity prices  primarily affecting ngl products  the company has reduced its budget for capital expenditures in from the levels expended in and capital expenditures related to existing operations are expected to be approximately million during  consisting of the following i capital expenditures related to gathering  processing and pipeline assets are expected to be approximately million  of which million is for maintaining existing facilities  ii capital expenditures on exploration and production activities are expected to be approximately million  and iii capital expenditures for miscellaneous items are expected to be approximately million 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and in southwest wyoming operations represent and  respectively  of the total budget

risk management activities the company s commodity price risk management program has two primary objectives 
the first goal is to preserve and enhance the value of the company s equity volumes of gas and ngls with regard to the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow  net income and earnings per share in relation to those anticipated by the company s operating budget 
the second goal is to manage price risk related to the company s physical gas  crude oil and ngl marketing activities to protect profit margins 
this risk relates to hedging fixed price purchase and sale commitments  preserving the value of storage inventories  reducing exposure to physical market price volatility and providing risk management services to a variety of customers 
the company utilizes a combination of fixed price forward contracts  exchange traded futures and options  as well as fixed index swaps  basis swaps and options traded in the over the counter otc market to accomplish these objectives 
these instruments allow the company to preserve value and protect margins because gains or losses in the physical market are offset by corresponding losses or gains in the value of the financial instruments 
the company uses futures  swaps and options to reduce price risk and basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
the company enters into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and the kansas city board of trade and through otc swaps and options with various counterparties  consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
the company conducts its standard credit review of otc counterparties and has agreements with such parties that contain collateral requirements 
the company generally uses standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
the company s otc credit risk exposure is partially limited by its ability to require a margin deposit from its major counterparties based upon the mark to market value of their net exposure 
the company is subject to margin deposit requirements under these same agreements 
in addition  the company is subject to similar margin deposit requirements for its nymex counterparties related to its net exposures 
the use of financial instruments may expose the company to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i equity volumes are less than expected  ii the company s customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii the company s otc counterparties fail to perform 
to the extent that the company engages in hedging activities  it may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  it is similarly insulated against decreases in such prices 
the company has hedged a portion of its equity volumes of gas and ngls in  particularly in the first quarter  at pricing levels approximating its operating budget 
the company s equity hedging strategy establishes a minimum and maximum price to the company while allowing market participation between these levels 
as of february   the company had hedged approximately of its anticipated equity gas for at a weighted average nymex equivalent minimum price of per mcf  including approximately of first quarter anticipated equity volumes at a weighted average nymex equivalent minimum price of per mcf 
additionally  the company has hedged approximately of its anticipated equity ngls for at a weighted average composite mont belvieu and west texas intermediate crude equivalent minimum price of 
per gallon 
at december   the company had million of losses deferred in inventory that will be recognized primarily during the first quarter of and are expected to be offset by margins from the company s related forward fixed price hedges and physical sales 
at december   the company had unrecognized net gains of million related to financial instruments that are expected to be offset by corresponding unrecognized net losses from the company s obligations to sell physical quantities of gas and ngls 
the company enters into speculative futures  swap and option trades on a very limited basis for purposes that include testing of hedging techniques 
the company s policies contain strict guidelines for such trading including predetermined stop loss requirements and net open positions limits 
speculative futures  swap and option positions are marked to market at the end of each accounting period and any gain or loss is recognized in income for that period 
net gains or losses from such speculative activities for the years ended december  and were not material

the company uses a value at risk var model designed by jp morgan as one measure of market risk for the company s natural gas portfolio 
the var calculated by this model represents the maximum change in market value over the holding period at the specified statistical confidence interval 
the var model is generally based upon jp morgan s riskmetrics tm methodology using historical price data to derive estimates of volatility and correlation for estimating the contribution of tenor and location risk 
the var model assumes a one day holding period and uses a confidence level 
as of december   the calculated var of the company s entire natural gas portfolio of futures  swaps and options was approximately million 
this figure includes the risk related to the company s entire portfolio of natural gas financial instruments and does not include the related underlying hedged physical transactions
