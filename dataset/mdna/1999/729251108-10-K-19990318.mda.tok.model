item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations events and trends affecting operating results market forces 
the demand for logs and manufactured wood products depends upon international and domestic market conditions  the value of the us dollar in foreign exchange markets  competition  the availability of substitute products and other factors 
in particular  the demand for logs  lumber  plywood and mdf is affected by residential and industrial construction  and repair and remodel activity 
these activities are subject to fluctuations due to changes in economic conditions  tariffs  interest rates  population growth and other economic  demographic and environmental factors 
additionally  the demand for logs is impacted by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets 
current market conditions 
throughout there was an excess supply of logs and lumber in the us market due to the economic weakness in asia 
as a result  prices for domestic logs in the cascades region for decreased by approximately from levels experienced in the supply of logs in the cascades region increased significantly due to both the re direction of export quality logs to the domestic market and an inflow of logs from british columbia 
prices for domestic logs in the rocky mountain region for declined modestly from those experienced during  primarily as a result of weak lumber markets and an excess supply of logs caused by the asian economic crisis 
pulp logs and chip prices in the northwest generally remained weak during due to a world wide excess supply of pulp and paper 
domestic log prices in the southern region for were generally comparable to those experienced during however  prices were under downward pressure during the second half of the year primarily due to an excess supply of lumber and favorable harvesting conditions 
pulp log prices in the southern region improved slightly compared to  primarily due to log supply shortages in the first half of the year as a result of weather related harvesting curtailments 
export log prices for decreased by approximately from levels experienced in primarily due to the continued economic weakness in asia 
demand for logs during remained weak due to a decline in japanese housing starts estimated to be million in compared to million in  high unemployment  weakness in the japanese yen  and low japanese consumer confidence 
industry composite indices for lumber commodity prices were lower in than in primarily due to the worldwide excess supply of lumber 
despite declining lumber prices  the demand for lumber remains extremely strong primarily due to a robust us economy  low interest rates  healthy job growth and strong consumer confidence 
both housing starts and new home sales in were approximately above the prior year s figures 
however  due to weak asian markets  the supply of lumber in the united states increased 
the increased supply was primarily due to the re direction of lumber that was previously targeted toward japanese markets and increased substitution of engineered wood products 
furthermore  lumber prices in the south have experienced greater downward pressure primarily due to increased substitution of western species and engineered wood products for southern yellow pine 
board prices for in the repair and remodel markets declined by over from the prior year levels 
the price decline was primarily due to increased imports from european producers as a result of the weak asian markets and increased domestic production as a result of weak dimension lumber prices 
european lumber producers exported approximately three times the volume mmbf or of the us board market to the us in compared to industry composite indices for plywood commodity prices in were comparable with commodity plywood prices were generally under downward pressure during the first half of due to continued osb capacity expansion 
osb continues to capture a significant share of the north american structural panel market with approximately in however  commodity plywood prices improved during the second half of primarily due to strong building activity  rising osb prices and recent plywood plant closures 
industrial and specialty grade plywood prices remained strong during mdf prices in were comparable to prices 
north american demand for mdf continues to grow at approximately per year  primarily due to increased acceptance and expanded applications 
the largest growth is occurring in applications that require high quality panels  such as kitchen cabinets and moldings 
however  despite improving demand  prices were generally under downward pressure during the fourth quarter of  due to increased supply as a result of three new mills beginning operations in  better operating performance by start up mills and the re direction to north american markets of mdf previously targeted toward asian markets 
comparability of financial statement periods 
the company has pursued and will continue to pursue the acquisition of additional timberlands to increase inventories of fee timber 
on november   the company completed the maine timberland acquisition 
on october   the company completed the southern region acquisition 
the company may also  from time to time  sell timberlands and facilities if attractive opportunities arise 
the newport asset sale was completed on october  revenues and operating income generated by the assets sold in the newport asset sale were million and million  respectively  in and were million and million  respectively  in see item business acquisitions 
accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the company s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures 
harvest plans 
the partnership determines its harvesting plans based on a number of factors  including age and size of  and species distribution within  its timber acreage  economic maturity of each harvest area  environmental considerations and mill requirements both in the lumber and plywood facilities and at unaffiliated mills 
harvest levels in the rocky mountain region averaged approximately mmbf in and harvest levels in and are expected to decline slightly compared to harvest levels 
by the year  the partnership anticipates that it will have nearly completed the conversion of slower growing forests to younger  more productive stands in the rocky mountain region  at which time a moderate reduction in the region s harvest levels is anticipated 
harvest levels in the cascades region averaged mmbf during to before declining approximately in harvest levels in including sawlogs and pulpwood are expected to decline moderately before stabilizing in future years as the conversion of slower growing forests to younger  more productive stands nears completion 
harvest levels in the northeast region including sawlogs and pulpwood are anticipated to approximate million tons in and remain stable for the foreseeable future 
harvest levels in the southern region including sawlogs and pulpwood were approximately and thousand cunits m cunits during and  respectively 
the harvest volume is expected to approximate the level in during  the partnership will complete both the conversion of mature second growth pine timberlands into intensively managed pine plantations and its accelerated thinning operations to improve growth rates 
as a result  the partnership anticipates moderate declines in harvest levels for the next several years 
thereafter harvest levels are expected to gradually increase as the partnership benefits from faster growing  intensively managed plantations 
harvest plans are influenced by inventories on fee lands  as well as projections of demand  price  availability of timber from other sources  availability of legal access and other factors that may be outside of the partnership s control 
accordingly  actual harvest levels may vary 
the partnership believes that its harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs and lumber 
stone container corporation 
a substantial portion of the company s wood chips derived from manufacturing lumber and plywood residual chips in the rocky mountain region are sold to stone container corporation under a long term supply agreement 
this agreement generally provides for market based pricing for residual chips subject to certain minimum and maximum prices until december  if market prices for chips remain at current levels  which are below the minimum level set by the supply agreement  annual operating income related to sales of residual chips would be reduced by approximately million starting in the year the actual impact of the phase out of the minimum pricing provision  however  cannot be accurately predicted  and will depend on future market prices 
impact of the year issue overview of the plan the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
this could result in a system failure or miscalculation in the year when using date sensitive software 
during the first quarter of  the company adopted a year plan to identify and address both internal and external year issues 
the year plan addresses information technology systems  process control systems and embedded chips used in its manufacturing operations  and key business relationships 
pursuant to the plan  the company completed a company wide assessment of its information technology systems in to determine the impact of the year issue 
most of the necessary revisions to the systems and processes were completed by year end  with complete testing and verification of the systems and processes for year compliance to occur during assessment of the company s state of readiness over the last five years the company has replaced many of its business computer systems in order to realize cost savings and process improvements 
a majority of these replacements  all of which are year compliant  were completed prior to the company wide year issue assessment  and the related costs have been capitalized 
in  the replacement of the payroll and human resources system will be completed at an approximate cost of  for and an approximate cost of  for these costs will also be capitalized 
currently  the payroll and human resources system replacement is complete 
the company s log accounting systems have required program modifications to achieve year readiness 
the program modifications and testing will be completed in early at an approximate cost of  for and an approximate cost of  for company information systems personnel are performing all remediation efforts  and the related costs will be expensed as incurred 
the log accounting systems modifications and testing are complete 
during  the company completed an inventory of the process control systems and embedded chips used in its manufacturing operations and identified the systems that could be subject to year problems 
the systems used in the lumber and plywood operations will require minimal changes  while the mdf systems will require the replacement of certain process control software 
the modifications and testing of the manufacturing control systems will be completed in at an approximate cost of  for and an approximate cost of  for these costs will be expensed as incurred 
currently  the modifications and testing of the manufacturing process control systems is complete 
as part of the company s year plan  service providers  vendors  suppliers and customers that are critical to the company s operations key business partners have been notified and steps are being undertaken to determine their year readiness through questionnaires  interviews  and other available means 
the company s efforts to determine the readiness of key business partners and the potential impacts on the company s operations if such key business partners are not year compliant will be ongoing through year end risks of the company s year issues the company relies on key business partners for materials and services 
failure by key business partners to achieve year compliance could temporarily impact the ability of the company to operate 
however  the impact of the failure of a key business partner would be limited to the extent that sufficient alternate supplies of materials or services were available 
the company is also dependent upon its customers for sales and cash flow 
year interruptions in its customers operations could result in reduced sales  increased inventory or receivable levels  and cash flow reductions 
while these events are possible  the company s customer base is broad enough to minimize the effects of individual occurrences 
contingency plan the company is working to evaluate the need for contingency plans to mitigate possible business disruptions 
contingency plans may include increasing raw materials inventories  securing alternate sources of supply  or modifying production schedules 
additionally  should the company determine that certain key business partners may fail to achieve year readiness  appropriate contingency plans would be developed 
summary based on the company s assessments  year issues relating to its information technology systems and process control systems and embedded chips used in its manufacturing operations are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
furthermore  the company will continue to monitor the progress of its key business partners in achieving year compliance  and  to the extent practicable  will develop contingency plans 
however  no assurance can be given that key business partners will achieve year compliance on a timely basis  or the extent to which operations may be impacted in the event that key business partners fail to achieve year compliance 
results of operations the following table compares operating income by segment for the years ended december operating income by segment in thousands lumber    northern resources    panel    southern resources    land sales    other    total segment operating income    other costs eliminations    total    the accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in note to notes to combined financial statements 
for segment purposes  however  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market on the first in  first out fifo method 
therefore  the difference in computing cost of goods sold under the lifo and fifo methods is included in other costs eliminations

land sales segment operating income was and as a percentage of its revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
land sales segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to additional sales 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead  intercompany log profit elimination and the change in the lifo reserve decreased operating income by million in  compared to million in the change in other costs and eliminations of million is primarily due to a decrease in the deferral of intercompany log profit elimination  offset in part by increased corporate overhead 
the profit on intercompany log sales is deferred eliminated until the lumber and plywood manufacturing facilities convert existing log inventories into finished products and sell them to third parties at which time intercompany profit is recognized 
during  intercompany log profit of million was released while million was deferred during the increase in operating income due to intercompany log profit is primarily due to the build up of log inventories in southern resources in the fourth quarter of and the subsequent processing of these logs in the first quarter of during weather related harvest restrictions 
similar log inventories were not built up during the fourth quarter of the decrease in operating income due to corporate overhead is primarily due to achieving the fifth and final target under the company s long term incentive plan and key employee long term incentive plan in april the expense related to these plans was approximately million in  compared to million in a portion of the increase was offset by lower incentive compensation accruals due to lower earnings levels 
reorganization costs of million are costs associated with the proposed conversion of the partnership to a reit

reorganization costs consist of fees for legal  investment banking and tax consultants  as well as printing and other related costs 
reorganization costs are being expensed as incurred 
the income allocated to the general partner increased by million to million for  compared to million for  primarily due to higher quarterly distributions to unitholders 
net income is allocated to the general partner based on two percent of the company s net income adjusted for the incentive distribution  plus the incentive distribution 
the general partner s incentive distribution is based on the number of outstanding units times a percentage of the per unit distribution paid to limited partners  which totaled per unit for the year ended  compared to per unit for the year ended compared to lumber segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this increase was due to additional revenues of million from the southern lumber facilities and increased lumber sales prices  offset in part by lower lumber sales volumes and decreased northwest chip revenues 
lumber sales prices in the northwest increased by  primarily due to strength in the us housing market and the reduction in supply of certain preferred western species 
northwest lumber sales volume decreased by compared to  primarily due to the october sale of the arden sawmill in colville  washington 
wood chip sales volume decreased compared to due to the sale of the arden sawmill 
lumber segment operating income was and as a percentage of its revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to higher northwest lumber prices and the southern region acquisition

northern resources segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decline in rocky mountain region log sales volume  lower export sales volume  and a decrease in export log sales prices 
domestic log sales volume in the rocky mountain region decreased by compared to  as a result of the october sale of  acres of timberlands 
export sales volumes decreased by primarily as a result of the re direction of export quality logs to the domestic market due to weak export markets 
export prices decreased by compared to  due to decreased demand as a result of the weakness in japan s domestic economy and an increase in the global supply of logs targeted toward the japanese market 
northern resources segment operating income was and as a percentage of its revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to higher log and haul costs in the rocky mountain region and lower export log sales prices 
northern resources segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the decline in rocky mountain region log sales volume  offset in part by increased log and haul costs in the rocky mountain region 
rocky mountain region log and haul costs increased by as a result of more expensive logging methods 
panel segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher plywood and mdf sales volumes  offset in part by lower mdf sales prices 
plywood sales volume in the northwest increased by compared to  primarily as a result of increased production due to additional production shifts and capital improvements 
mdf sales volume increased by primarily due to greater efficiencies from high energy refiners that were installed in the third quarter of mdf sales prices decreased by primarily as a result of industry capacity expansion and aggressive pricing by start up mills 
panel segment operating income was and as a percentage of its revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively

land sales segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead  intercompany log profit elimination and the change in the lifo reserve decreased operating income by million in  compared to million in the variance of million was primarily due to an increase in both corporate overhead and the deferral of intercompany profit 
the increase in corporate overhead is primarily due to expense resulting from the achievement of a unit value target uvt under the company s long term incentive plan and key employee long term incentive plan during the third quarter of and the addition of the southern region 
the increase in deferred intercompany log profit was a result of increasing inventory levels in mill log inventories levels in the southern region increased as a result of anticipated weather related harvesting curtailments during the first quarter of and  in the northwest  due to favorable harvesting conditions during the fourth quarter of the profit on intercompany log sales is deferred eliminated until the lumber and plywood manufacturing facilities convert existing log inventories into finished products and sell them to third parties at which time intercompany profit is recognized 
the achievement of a uvt under the company s long term incentive plan and key employee long term incentive plan resulted in million of expense in  the majority of which was included in selling  general and administrative expenses  compared to an expense of million in interest expense increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to the issuance of million of senior notes in the fourth quarter of related to the southern region acquisition 
gain on disposition of assets in included million related to the newport asset sale 
the income allocated to the general partner increased by million during compared to due to higher quarterly distributions to unitholders and the issuance of million additional limited partner units in the fourth quarter of  offset in part by lower net income 
net income is allocated to the general partner based on two percent of the company s net income adjusted for the incentive distribution paid  plus the incentive distribution 
the incentive distribution is based on a percentage of the quarterly distribution paid which totaled per unit for the year ended  compared to per unit in export sales the company sells logs and finished wood products for export 
these sales are denominated in us dollars and are generally sold to pacific rim countries  principally japan  and to canada and europe 
combined export revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for   and  respectively 
financial condition and liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease of million in was primarily due to lower net income of million  offset in part by a positive working capital variance of million and an increase in other operating cash flow adjustments of million 
the positive working capital variance is primarily related to a favorable million fluctuation in inventories and a favorable million fluctuation in other current liabilities  offset in part by an unfavorable million fluctuation in other current assets 
the favorable inventory fluctuation is primarily due to the build up of log inventories in the company s southern region in the fourth quarter of and the subsequent processing of these logs in the first quarter of during weather related harvesting curtailments 
the southern region did not build similar log inventories in the fourth quarter of the favorable other current liabilities fluctuation is primarily due to the partially deferred funding of the fifth target of the company s long term incentive plans until the first quarter of in january  a final payment of million was made in connection with the funding of the plans 
the unfavorable other current assets fluctuation is primarily due to the collection of a million installment note receivable in the first quarter of related to a fourth quarter higher and better use land sale 
other operating cash flow adjustments increased operating cash flow by million for  compared to million for the increase of million was primarily due to the amortization of expense associated with the long term incentive plans and land basis associated with higher and better use land sales 
on december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents 
the increase of net cash provided by operating activities of million in is primarily the result of a favorable million fluctuation in depreciation  depletion and amortization and a favorable working capital variance of million 
the increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization is primarily due to increased harvest activity as a result of the southern region acquisition 
the partnership has an unsecured revolving line of credit line of credit with a group of banks 
subject to customary covenants  the line of credit allows the partnership to borrow up to million for general corporate purposes  including up to million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the partnership or manufacturing 
the line of credit matures on december  and bears a floating rate of interest 
as of december   the partnership had million outstanding under the line of credit with million remaining availability 
as of january   million of borrowings on the line of credit were repaid 
on november   the partnership acquired  acres of forest lands in central maine from sd warren company  a pennsylvania company  for a total purchase price of million 
see note to notes to combined financial statements 
the acquisition was financed with approximately million in cash and the balance with unsecured promissory notes that were issued to the seller 
the notes have an average maturity of approximately years 
the face amount of the unsecured promissory notes totals million  with the stated interest rates ranging from to 
the fair market value of the notes is million  reflecting a note premium due to the notes above market interest rates 
see note of notes to combined financial statements 
on october   the partnership acquired approximately  acres plus approximately  leased acres of timberland in louisiana and arkansas  along with two sawmills  a plywood plant and a nursery in the southern region acquisition for a total purchase price of million  plus million for working capital 
the partnership financed the southern region acquisition from cash on hand  including proceeds from certain ordinary course asset dispositions  the proceeds from the newport asset sale  and two new bank credit facilities dated as of october   the new bank facilities  consisting of the line of credit  initially a five year million unsecured  revolving credit facility and an month million unsecured bridge facility the bridge facility 
the partnership borrowed million under the bridge facility and million under the line of credit to finance the southern region acquisition 
no further borrowings are permitted under the bridge facility 
on october   the partnership issued  units for net proceeds of million 
on november    additional units were issued by the partnership for net proceeds of million 
the combined net proceeds were used to repay the bridge facility and a portion of the amount outstanding under the line of credit 
on november   the partnership issued million of senior notes the new notes in a private placement 
the new notes have an average life of years and bear interest at a weighted average rate of annually 
the new notes are unsecured obligations of the partnership and the terms of the new notes are substantially similar to the terms of its existing senior notes 
the proceeds from the new notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the line of credit 
the commitment under the line of credit was reduced to million in november the company s borrowing agreements contain certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on harvest levels  sale of assets  cash distributions and the incurrence of indebtedness 
in addition  the line of credit requires the maintenance of a required interest coverage ratio 
the company was in compliance with its debt covenants as of december  with the exception of the line of credit  all of the company s lenders have provided written consents to the conversion transaction 
see note of notes to combined financial statements 
management expects to receive the consent of its line of credit lenders 
should the consent not be obtained  the general partner believes a replacement line of credit could be obtained on substantially similar terms  with no material impact to the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the partnership distributed per unit for the fourth quarter of the distribution equaled million including million to the general partner  and was paid on february  to unitholders of record on february  the computation of cash available for distribution includes required reserves for the payment of principal and interest  as well as other reserves established at the discretion of the general partner for working capital  capital expenditures  and future cash distributions 
cash required to meet the company s quarterly cash distributions  capital expenditures and principal and interest payments will be significant 
as a result of the indebtedness incurred to finance the maine timberland acquisition and as a result of current and expected operating performance  the general partner expects that the partnership may not be able to incur significant levels of additional indebtedness in  under the terms of its current debt agreements 
the general partner believes  however  that borrowings under its line of credit  cash otherwise on hand and cash flows from continuing operations will be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures  distributions  and interest and principal payments in capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million for  and  respectively  excluding million related to the maine timberland acquisition in and million related to the southern region acquisition in capital expenditures in included the reconfiguration of the joyce  louisiana facility and the meridian acquisition  as well as approximately million for equipment replacements and upgrades in our manufacturing facilities and approximately million primarily for logging roads  reforestation and expenditures related to our timberlands 
approximately million was invested during at joyce  louisiana to construct a state of the art  high volume sawmill 
in may  the partnership completed the meridian acquisition for million which includes million of working capital 
planned capital expenditures for are million 
planned capital expenditures include approximately million to complete the construction of the joyce  louisiana sawmill  million for replacement and equipment upgrades in our manufacturing facilities and million for logging roads  reforestation and expenditures related to our timberlands
