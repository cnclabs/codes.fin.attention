liquidity and capital resources the company s primary cash requirements are to fund the company s working capital needs  primarily inventories and accounts receivable  and to purchase property and equipment 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during cash provided by operating activities was comprised of the company s net loss of million for the year ended december  and cash used to pay down accrued liabilities of million  offset by a federal tax refund of million  a million reduction in inventory and the non cash charge of million associated with the write down of assets related to the lease restructuring 
at december   working capital was approximately million as compared to million at december  due primarily to a million reduction in inventory  the collection of refundable taxes and funding of the loss sustained by the company during working capital may vary from time to time as a result of seasonality  new product introductions  capital expenditures and changes in inventory levels 
to supplement cash flow from operations  the company maintains a million revolving credit facility with a factor to be used for general working capital purposes 
the facility also allows for up to million in letters of credit 
all obligations under the credit facility  which includes a letter of credit facility  are collateralized by the company s inventory  receivables  machinery and equipment and intangibles 
the credit agreement has various restrictive covenants which include the company s earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda  exposure in excess of account receivable availability and capital expenditure limitations 
the company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  the company had borrowings of million outstanding on the line of credit as of december  in march  the lender s commitment under the finance agreement was extended through april  historically  the company has sold a substantial portion of its trade accounts receivable to a factor  which assumes the credit risk with respect to collection of nonrecourse accounts receivable in exchange for a fee 
the factor approves the credit of the company s customer prior to sales 
if the factor disapproves of a sale to a customer and the company decides to proceed with the sales  the company bears the credit risk 
prior to july  the factoring agreement provided that the company s could request advances against a percentage of qualifying accounts receivable 
in conjunction with the company s credit facility  the advance facility associated with the factoring agreement was terminated 
the factor agreement is in force through june  cash flows used in investing activities totaled  for and was comprised of capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds received from the disposal of assets from the company s screen printing subsidiary  giannico  inc by reason of the company s treatment as an s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes  the company  since inception through its initial public offering  provided to its sole stockholder funds for the payment of income taxes on the earnings of the company through the termination of s corporation status 
in addition  the company historically paid dividends to its sole stockholder to provide a return on investment 
in connection with its initial public offering  the company s s corporation status was terminated and the company declared the final s corporation distribution of its previously undistributed earnings 
for the year ended december  the company paid dividends  including amounts attributable to the payment of taxes and a portion of the final s corporation distribution  of million 
for the foreseeable future  earnings will be retained in the operation of the business 
the company believes that current cash and their revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
significant accounting estimates in recent years certain customers of the company have experienced financial difficulties  including the filing of reorganization under bankruptcy laws 
the company has not generally incurred significant losses outside the normal course of business as a result of the financial difficulties of these customers 
while management believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at december  is adequate  the company carefully monitors developments regarding its major customers 
additional material financial difficulties encountered by these or other customers could have an adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
seasonality the company s business is impacted by general seasonal trends that are characteristic of many companies in the apparel industry 
however  due primarily to the significant growth that the company experienced during and the declining sales experienced in and  past quarterly sales and profit trends have not reflected normal apparel industry seasonality 
in future years  the company expects that its sales may reflect greater seasonal trends 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on its net sales or profitability 
although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which the company s products are manufactured  the company does not believe that they have had a material effect on the company s net sales or profitability 
in the past  the company has been able to offset its foreign product cost increases by increasing prices or changing suppliers  although no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to make such increases or changes in the future 
exchange rates the company receives united states dollars for substantially all of its product sales and its licensing revenues 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in united states dollars  however  purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the company s cost of goods in the future 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on the company s inventory costs 
the company does not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income  and sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components and sfas no 
establishes standards for the way public companies report financial information about operating segments 
the company adopted both new standards in fiscal  as required 
these statements affect disclosure and presentation in the financial statements but do not have an effect on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity  cash flows or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements because the company does not currently hold any derivative instruments 
year general the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company s computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  and engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has assessed how it may be impacted by the year issue and has formulated and commenced implementation of a plan to address the known aspects of the issue 
the plan the company s plan encompasses its information systems  production and facilities equipment that utilize date time oriented software of computer chips  products  vendors and customers and will be carried out in four phases assessment and development of a plan  remediation  testing  and implementation 
with regard to information systems  production and facilities equipment and products  the company is substantially complete with the assessment and plan development phase and is approximately complete with its total planned efforts including remediation  testing and implementation 
the company expects that its remediation efforts in these areas will be substantially completed by june the company is also reviewing the efforts of its vendors and customers to become year compliant 
the company has divided these vendors and customers into several groups such as financial institutions  software and system suppliers  critical customers and manufacturers 
each group was reviewed based on its level of technological dependence  frequency of interactions and need by the company to continue operations 
the company has received approximately of the responses from the more technologically dependent vendors and customers  of which responded with written assurances that they expect to address all of their known significant year issues on a timely basis 
the company is currently contacting its remaining vendors and customers to ensure that they are year compliant 
the company anticipates that these activities will be on going for the remainder of and will include follow up telephone interviews and on site meetings as considered necessary in the circumstances 
although this review is continuing  the company is not currently aware of any vendor or customer circumstances that may have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company will be seeking alternative suppliers if possible where circumstances warrant 
the company can provide no assurance that year compliance plans will be successfully completed by suppliers and customers in a timely manner 
cost the costs related to year compliance are not expected to be significant 
existing maintenance agreements with the software providers covered the majority of costs related to the upgrade of its internal accounting and proprietary business software 
these systems were upgraded in december of the company believes that necessary conversions of other operational systems can also be accomplished through vendor upgrades and enhancements as provided under its system maintenance agreements currently in effect 
risk the company believes that the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for the company 
however  if all year issues are not properly identified  or assessment  remediation and testing are not affected in a timely manner with respect to problems that are identified  there can be no assurance that the year issue will not have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or adversely affect the company s relationships with customers  vendors  or others 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the year issues of other entities will not have a material adverse impact on the company s systems or results of operations 
contingency plan the company has started a comprehensive analysis of the operational problems and costs including loss of revenue that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure by the company and certain third parties to complete efforts necessary to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
a contingency plan has not been finalized for dealing with the most reasonably likely worst case scenario as such scenario has not yet been clearly identified 
the company is currently undergoing this analysis and contingency planning which will be complete by june quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company does not have any derivative financial instruments as of december  further  the company is not exposed to interest rate risk as the company s revolving line of credit and factoring agreement have variable interest rates 
therefore  the fair value of these instruments are not affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company believes that the market risk arising from holdings of its financial instruments is not material
