the markets served by cis and galaxy complement the company s traditional telephone service provider and private network operator markets 
during  the company continued to execute its total network solutions strategy of broadening its offering of proprietary equipment and services by acquiring four businesses 
in the first quarter of  the company acquired ati  a designer and manufacturer of digital microwave and millimeterwave radio systems for voice  data and or video applications and a majority stake in nact  a single source provider of advanced telecommunications switching platforms with integrated telephony software applications and network telemanagement capabilities 
in october  the company acquired the remaining minority interest in nact 
in november  the company acquired telco  a designer and manufacturer of broadband transmission  network access and bandwidth optimization products 
during  telco has been building a core product portfolio that incorporates new technologies and strategically positions it for the impending evolution of telecommunications markets 
telco systems made two strategic acquisitions in that expanded its product offerings from circuit switched into packet switched  frame relay and atm markets 
in december  the company acquired resurgens  a provider of wholesale international long distance services 
resurgens now conducts its business as the world access telecommunications group 
as a result of the resurgens acquisition  worldcom  a major customer and vendor of resurgens  now owns approximately of the outstanding common stock of the company 
through the completion of the acquisitions in  the company believes it is now positioned to offer its customers a complete telecommunications network solutions  including access to international long distance  proprietary equipment  and network planning and engineering services 
the company s management believes that numerous synergies exist as a result of these acquisitions  including cross selling opportunities  technology development and cost savings 
in december  john d 
jack phillips was appointed the company s new president and chief executive officer 
mr 
phillips was formerly the president and chief executive officer of resurgens 
also in december  two new outside directors joined the company s board 
in connection with the recently completed acquisitions  the appointment of a new chief executive officer and the election of the new directors  the company approved and began implementing a major restructuring program to reorganize its operating structure  consolidate several facilities  outsource its manufacturing requirements  rationalize its product offerings and related development efforts  and pursue other potential synergies expected to be realized as a result of the integration of recently acquired businesses 
the company expects the plans associated with the program to be substantially completed during the second quarter of in december  the company formalized its plan to offer for sale all of its non core businesses  which consist of the resale of nortel and other original equipment manufacturers wireline switching equipment  third party repair of telecom equipment and pay telephone refurbishment 
these businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations and  accordingly  the results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the past few years  the company has significantly strengthened its balance sheet through improved operating results  a million sale of convertible subordinated notes  a million secondary public equity offering and a recently executed million credit facility 
the company has used this capital for acquisitions and to support the working capital requirements associated with the company s growth

discontinued operations overview 
during  the company broadened its offering of proprietary equipment by acquiring three equipment businesses 
the company acquired ati  a designer and manufacturer of digital microwave and millimeterwave radio systems for voice  data and or video applications  nact  a single source provider of advanced telecommunications switching platforms with integrated telephony software applications and network telemanagement capabilities and telco  a designer and manufacturer of broadband transmission  network access and bandwidth optimization products 
in connection with the completion of the acquisitions above  certain of the company s non proprietary businesses became non strategic 
in december  the company formalized its plan to offer for sale all of its non core businesses  which consist of the resale of nortel and other original equipment manufacturers wireline switching equipment  third party repair of telecom equipment and pay telephone refurbishment 
on january   the company formally announced its intention to sell these businesses 
management expects that the sale will be completed in these businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations and  accordingly  the results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
compared to sales increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in the resale of nortel and other original equipment manufacturers wireline switching equipment at the company s ait business 
gross profit before special charges increased million  or  to million in gross profit margin before special charges declined to in from in the company elected to sell approximately million of nortel equipment at substantially reduced margins in the fourth quarter in anticipation of additional pricing pressure and in an effort to reduce the inventory levels of this business 
the company also experienced margin declines in the pay telephone refurbishment business in related to the introduction of a vandal resistant pay telephone modification which carries lower margins than the historical refurbishment revenues 
during  the company also recorded special charges of approximately million relating to the non core businesses see restructuring and other charges 
compared to sales increased million  or to million in from million in the increase was due to growth in nortel resale business of ait and pay telephone refurbishment 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross profit margin decreased to in from in the decline in gross profit margin in related to margin pressure experienced by the nortel resale business 
purchased in process research and development overview 
in connection with the ati  nact and telco mergers in  the company wrote off purchased in process r d totaling million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts were expensed as non recurring charges on the respective acquisition dates 
these write offs were necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternate use 
the value of the purchased in process technology from ati was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to in process research and development projects  including costs to complete the development of the technology 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
these estimates were based on several assumptions  including those summarized below 
the value of the purchased in process technology from nact and telco was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to in process research and development projects  excluding costs to complete the development of the technology 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value 
the projected net cash flows from such projects were based on management s estimates of revenues and operating profits related to such projects 
these estimates were based on several assumptions  including those summarized below for each respective acquisition 
the resultant net present value amount was then reduced by a stage of completion factor 
this factor more specifically captures the development risk of an in process technology ie  market risk is still incorporated in the estimated rate of return 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification  and test activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
if these projects to develop commercially viable products based on the purchased in process technology are not successfully completed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets may become impaired 
ati merger 
ati develops and manufactures a series of high performance digital microwave and millimeterwave radio equipment 
their products reach across all frequency bands and data rates and offer numerous features 
the nature of the in process research and development was such that technological feasibility had not been attained 
failure to attain technological feasibility would have rendered partially designed equipment useless for other applications 
ati s products are designed for specific frequency bandwidths and  as such  are highly customized to those bandwidths and the needs of customers wishing to operate in them 
products only partially completed for certain bandwidths cannot be used in other bandwidths 
between each product line  various stages of development had been reached 
additionally  within each product line  different units had reached various stages of development 
of the products management considered in process  none had attained technological feasibility 
the purchased in process technology acquired in the ati acquisition was comprised of three primary projects related to high performance  digital microwave and millimeterwave radio equipment 
each project consists of multiple products 
these projects were at multiple stages along ati s typical development timeline 
some projects were beginning testing in ati labs  others were at earlier stages of planning and designing 
the majority of the products were scheduled to be released during  and early revenue projections for the in process technologies reflected the anticipated release dates of each project 
revenue attributable to in process technology was estimated to increase within the first three years of the seven year projection at annual rates ranging from a high of to a low of  decreasing within the remaining years at annual rates ranging from to as other products are released in the marketplace 
projected annual revenue attributable to in process technology ranged from approximately a low of million to a high of million within the term of the projections 
these projections were based on assumed penetration of the existing customer base and movement into new markets 
projected revenues from in process technology were assumed to peak in and decline from through as other new products are expected to enter the market 
in process technology s contribution to the operating profit of ati earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization was estimated to grow within the projection period at annual rates ranging from a high of to a low of during the first four years  decreasing during the remaining years of the projection period similar to the revenue growth projections described above 
projected in process technology s annual contribution to operating profit loss ranged from approximately a low of  to a high of million within the term of the projections 
the discount rate used to value the in process technology of ati was 
this discount rate was estimated relative to the overall business discount rate of based on the incomplete status of the products expected to utilize the in process technology ie  development risk  the expected market risk of the planned products relative to the existing products  the emphasis on different markets than those currently pursued by ati  and the nature of remaining development tasks relative to previous development efforts 
management estimated that the costs to develop the in process technology acquired in the ati acquisition would be approximately million in the aggregate through the year the expected sources of funding were scheduled r d expenses from the operating budget of ati 
nact merger 
nact provides advanced telecommunications switching platforms with integrated applications software and network telemanagement capabilities 
nact designs  develops  and manufacturers all hardware and software elements necessary for a fully integrated  turnkey telecommunications switching solution 
the nature of the in process research and development was such that technological feasibility had not been attained 
failure to attain technological feasibility  especially given the high degree of customization required for complete integration into the nact solution  would have rendered partially designed hardware and software useless for other applications 
incomplete design of hardware and software coding would create a non connective  inoperable product that would have no alternative use 
nact s business plan called for a shift in market focus to large customers  both domestic and international  therefore  nact had numerous projects in development at the time of the acquisition 
additionally  the pending completion of a major release of nact s billing system required significant development efforts to ensure continued integration with nact s product suite 
the purchased in process technology acquired in the nact acquisition was comprised of projects related to switching and billing systems 
these projects were scheduled to be released between february and april these projects include planned additions of new products  based on undeveloped technologies  to nact s suite of stx and nts products 
the projects also include the creation of products for new product suites 
the research and development projects were at various stages of development 
none of the in process projects considered in the write off had attained technological feasibility 
the in process projects do not build on existing core technology  such existing technologies were valued as a separate asset 
a brief summary of the significant technologies nact was developing for their stx and nts products at the time of the acquisition is as follows stx application switching platform stx stx was introduced in may as an integrated digital tandem switching system which allows scalability from ports to a capacity of  ports per switch 
the stx can be combined with three additional stxs to provide a total capacity of  ports per system 
the current stx is not sufficiently developed to address nact s objective of targeting larger  more diverse telecommunications companies 
to move into this expanded customer base  nact has multiple development tasks planned for the stx product 
nact plans to incorporate into the stx certain features and enhancements such as ss and e discussed below  r signaling  and integrated services digital network  which are critical to the company s strategy to broaden its customer base 
the ss and e features are considered new products within the stx family of products 
master control unit mcu mcu is a database hub which can link up to four switches  creating a larger capacity tandem switch 
nact is developing an updated mcu  called the redundant mcu  which allows for intelligent peripheral or recognition of pre paid caller numbers 
redundant mcu is an important extension to the mcu system because it will allow a telecommunications company to create an entire switching network outside of the public network owned by major telecommunications firms 
nts telemanagement and billing system nts nts performs call rating  accounting  switch management  invoicing  and traffic engineering for multiple nact switches 
nact recently finished development of an improved billing system  the nts  which is designed for real time transaction processing with graphical user interface and improved call reports 
the nts is compatible with non nact switches 
the nts also allows for customization of invoices and reports 
e to t conversion the t is the switchboard hardware used in the stx 
the t product has been in existence for several years 
the e is the standard switchboard used in europe 
nact is creating a technology which facilitates compatibility between the t and the switchboard hardware currently used in europe 
in addition  nact is currently developing enhanced switchboard hardware called the t  which will allow for more calls to pass through the switchboard at one time 
both development efforts  the t and compatibility between e and t  are necessary as nact moves into international markets 
transmission control protocol internet protocol tcp ip connectivity tcp ip is the most common method of connecting personal computers  workstations and servers 
other historically dominant networking protocols  such as the local area network lan protocol and international packet exchange sequence packet exchange  are losing ground to tcp ip 
the addition of tcp ip is vital relative to nact s strategic objective of offering voice over internet 
the company is incorporating the motorola board in the stx application platform to enable the stx to support  ports per switch or  ports per integrated mcu system 
with this enhancement  the stx is expected to process significantly more call minutes per month 
signaling system ss ss is software that allows a call  which normally would have to go through a series of switchboards to reach its destination  to instead skip from the first switchboard to the last 
with the addition of this enhancement  the stx switch can interface with carriers more quickly and efficiently 
in addition  nact is developing the c  which is the european version of the ss nact had projects in development at the time of acquisition 
these projects were at multiple stages along nact s development timeline 
some projects were beginning testing in nact labs  others were at earlier stages of planning and designing 
these projects were scheduled for release between december and december revenue projections for the in process technologies reflected the anticipated release dates of each project 
revenue attributable to in process technology was assumed to increase in the first five years of the year projection at annual rates ranging from to  decreasing over the remaining years at annual rates ranging from to as other products are released in the marketplace 
projected annual revenue attributable to in process technology ranged from approximately a low of million to a high of million within the term of the projections 
these projections were based on assumed penetration of the existing customer base and movement into new markets 
projected revenues from in process technology were assumed to peak in and decline from through as other new products are expected to enter the market 
in process technology s contribution to the operating profit of nact earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization was projected to grow within the projection period at annual rates ranging from a high of to a low of during the first five years  decreasing during the remaining years of the projection period similar to the revenue growth projections described above 
projected in process technology s annual contribution to operating profit ranged from approximately million to million within the term of the projections 
the discount rate used to value the existing technology of nact was 
this discount rate was estimated relative to the overall business discount rate of based on the completed status of the products utilizing existing technology ie  the lack of development risk  and the potential for obsolescence of current products in the marketplace 
the discount rate used to value the in process technology of nact was 
this discount rate was estimated relative to the overall business discount rate of based on the incomplete status of the products expected to utilize the in process technology ie  development risk  the expected market risk of the planned products relative to the existing products  the emphasis on targeting larger customers for the planned products  the expected demand for the products from current and prospective nact customers  the anticipated increase in nact s sales force  and the nature of remaining development tasks relative to previous development efforts 
management estimates that the costs to develop the in process technology acquired in the nact acquisition will be approximately million in the aggregate through the year the expected sources of funding were scheduled research and development expenses from the operating budget of nact 
telco merger 
telco develops and manufactures products focused on providing integrated access for network services 
telco s products can be separated into three categories broadband transmission products  network access products  and bandwidth optimization products 
telco s products are deployed at the edge of the service provider s networks to provide organizations with a flexible  cost effective means of transmitting voice  data  video and image traffic over public or private networks 
at the time of acquisition  telco had several primary projects in development relating to next generation telecommunication and data network hardware 
these projects were at various stages in the development process 
some were about to enter the testing phase of the initial hardware prototype  while others were still in the early concept and design specification stages 
these projects were scheduled for commercial release at various points in time from december through early telco s in process research and development projects are being developed to run on new communications protocols and technologies not employed in its current products 
these include hdsl  sonet  voice over ip and atm inverse multiplexing 
additionally  the products to be commercialized from telco s in process research and development are expected to include interface support not in telco s current product line  including e  ds and oc a brief description of the significant in process projects is set forth below access release access release product provides essentially the same functional service as the existing access network access servers by providing highly reliable digital access to public  private and hybrid networks  integrating multiple business applications through cost effective connections to dedicated  switched and packet network services 
however  unlike the current versions  the technology underlying the release r version is based on high bit rate digital subscriber line hdsl technology 
this hdsl technology will enable high density voice and data applications to travel simultaneously over one to ten hdsl lines from a single platform  which will launch the r product into a whole new loop market by eliminating the need for service providers to have separate platforms for voice and data at the customer s premises or at the provider s central office 
although the access r product is designed to provide a service similar to the current access product  the core functional technology of the new r is very different  and the target market of the r product is different 
if technological feasibility is achieved  telco expects the product to be introduced into the market at the end of however  before that can occur  telco must complete the first prototype builds of the product and perform initial system testing which will not begin until the end of august in september  telco will begin testing for system quality assurance and expects to begin beta field testing in october or november edgelink e the edgelink e version is an addition to the family which will be marketed internationally 
conforming to all applicable etsi and itu standards  this product will provide a cornerstone to the next generation of international product offerings 
this product is in the mid stage of development 
software code generation is expected to be completed in april prototype builds for initial units are expected to be completed in may  and initial beta field tests are expected to begin in june sonet edge device the sonet edge device is a next generation edge device expected to provide access to sonet networks 
this access device will be designed to take a t voice input from a pbx or an access and convert to sonet formatted tributaries and send it out via a traditional sts interface 
this project is in the early concept stage  and is not expected to reach commercial viability until early documentation of the hardware and software design is expected to be completed in april  software code generation is expected to be completed in august  prototype builds for initial units are expected to be completed in october  and initial beta field tests are expected to begin in january edgelink the edgelink atm device will be designed to be a multislot version of the edgelink with ds and nxds interface support 
this product will incorporate an atm inverse multiplexer ima 
this product is in an early stage of development and is expected to reach commercial viability in early documentation of the hardware and software design is expected to be completed in june  prototype builds for initial units are expected to be completed in may  and initial beta field tests are expected to begin in december voice over packet engines voice over packet refers to sending voice transmissions over packet based communication protocols  such as internet protocols ip telephony  frame relay  or atm 
telco is currently in the early stages of developing the software and hardware for a generic engine to be integrated into the edgelink family of products to enable this functionality 
this is expected to be commercially viable in late software code generation is expected to be completed in june  prototype builds for initial units are expected to be completed in july  and initial beta field tests are expected to begin in september if these projects are not completed as planned  the in process research and development will have no alternative use 
failure of the in process technologies to achieve technological feasibility may adversely affect the future profitability of world access 
revenue attributable to telco s aggregate in process technology was assumed to increase over the first six years of the projection period at annual rates ranging from a high of to a low of  reflecting both the displacement of telco s old products by these new products as well as the expected growth in the overall market in which telco s products compete 
thereafter  revenues are projected to decline over the remaining projection period at annual rates ranging from to  as the acquired in process technologies become obsolete and are replaced by newer technologies 
management s projected annual revenues attributable to the aggregate acquired in process technologies  which assume that all such technologies achieve technological feasibility  ranged from a low of approximately million to a high of approximately million 
projected revenues were projected to peak in and decline thereafter through as other new products enter the market 
the acquired in process technology s contribution to the operating income was projected to grow over the first five years of the projection period at annual rates ranging from a high of to a low of with one intermediate year of marginally declining operating income 
thereafter  the contribution to operating income was projected to decline through the projection period 
the acquired in process technology s contribution to operating income ranged from a low of approximately million to a high of approximately million 
the discount rate used to value the existing technology was 
this discount rate was selected because of the asset s intangible characteristics  the risk associated with the economic life expectations of the technology and potential obsolescence of legacy products  and the risk associated with the financial assumptions with respect to the projections used in the analysis 
the discount rates used to value the in process technologies were and  depending on the stage of development 
these discount rates were selected due to several incremental inherent risks 
first the actual useful economic life of such technologies may differ from the estimates used in the analysis 
second  risks associated with the financial projections on the specific products that comprise the acquired in process research and development 
the third factor is the incomplete and unproven nature of the technologies 
finally  future technological advances that are currently unknown may negatively impact the economic and functional viability of the in process r d 
management expects that the cost to complete the development of the acquired in process technologies and to commercialize the resulting products will aggregate approximately million through over the projection period  management expects to spend an additional aggregate million on sustaining development efforts relating to the acquired in process technologies 
these sustaining efforts include bug fixing  form factor changes and identified upgrades 
restructuring and other charges summary 
during  the company approved and began implementing two restructuring programs designed to reduce operating costs  outsource manufacturing requirements and focus company resources on recently acquired business units containing proprietary technology or services 
management carefully reviewed the provisions of eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity in determining which costs related to the various actions should be included in the special charges 
no costs were included in the charge that would derive future economic benefit to the company  eg  relocation of existing employees  recruiting and training of new employees and facility start up costs 
a summary of restructuring and related charges recorded in connection with these programs follows continuing discontinued operations operations total in thousands first quarter restructuring charges severance and termination benefits idle facility costs   idle production equipment   related charges write down of inventories   total first quarter    fourth quarter restructuring charges severance and termination benefits   idle facility costs   asset write downs   other exit costs   related charges write down of inventories    provision for doubtful accounts    total fourth quarter    total charges    first quarter in january  the company s senior management decided that the following actions were necessary to streamline operations and position the company to service anticipated sales growth close down the existing orlando  florida manufacturing and repair facility 
move the manufacturing of certain world access products to the company s alpharetta  georgia manufacturing facility 
exit the contract manufacturing business 
close down four lakeland  florida facilities and move ait operations to a new facility in orlando  florida 
repair operations would be integrated with ait in this new facility 
close down westec s facility in scottsdale  arizona and integrate its operations into ati s facility in wilmington  massachusetts 
shortly thereafter  senior management informed the operating management of the applicable divisions 
all orlando and lakeland employees were informed in january and westec employees were informed in february subsequent to the closing of the ati acquisition 
severance and termination benefits were clearly communicated up front to the approximately employees who lost their jobs as a direct result of the consolidations 
affected employees were notified shortly after the january and february employee meetings 
benefits were determined consistent with the company s severance policy of one week of pay for each full year of service minimum of two weeks and continued benefits through the month severance pay is exhausted 
approximately of these employees were involuntarily terminated in february and march  approximately employees were involuntarily terminated in april and approximately employees were involuntarily terminated in june 
the orlando and lakeland facilities were closed in april and the scottsdale facility was closed in june 
the actual severance and termination benefit costs incurred by the company were not materially different from the  recorded in the special charge 
the idle facility and equipment portion of the special charge included the write off of old orlando  lakeland and scottsdale leasehold improvements  provisions for the estimated costs to terminate idle facility and equipment leases  the write off of orlando manufacturing equipment not relocated to the company s alpharetta facility and certain phase down expenses associated with the six facilities closed down 
as previously noted  all activities that resulted in the first quarter special charge were completed by the company as of june  of the  special charge  approximately million related to assets directly written off or amounts charged to the reserve in the first quarter 
as of december   the accrual for the first quarter special charges was approximately  which consisted primarily of lease termination losses expected to be incurred 
fourth quarter in december  in connection with the i recently completed nact merger  telco merger and resurgens merger  ii election of several new outside directors to the company s board  and iii appointment of a new chief executive officer  the company approved and began implementing a major restructuring program which included the following activities reorganize the company s equipment group operating structure 
consolidate the company s ati operations in wilmington  massachusetts into telco s facility in norwood  massachusetts 
outsource its electrical manufacturing requirements resulting in the sale of the company s alpharetta  georgia manufacturing facility to an established contract manufacturer

the company believes that existing cash balances  available borrowings under the company s line of credit and cash projected to be generated from operations will provide the company with sufficient capital resources to support its current working capital requirements and business plans for at least the next months 
quarterly operating results the company s quarterly operating results are difficult to forecast with any degree of accuracy because a number of factors subject these results to significant fluctuations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the company s telecommunications group carrier service revenues  costs and expenses have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of numerous factors 
the company s revenues in any given period can vary due to factors such as call volume fluctuations  particularly in regions with relatively high per minute rates  the addition or loss of major customers  whether through competition  merger  consolidation or otherwise  the loss of economically beneficial routing options for the termination of the company s traffic  financial difficulties of major customers  pricing pressure resulting from increased competition  and technical difficulties with or failures of portions of the company s network that impact the company s ability to provide service to or bill its customers 
the company s operating expenses in any given period can vary due to factors such as fluctuations in rates charged by carriers to terminate traffic  increases in bad debt expense and reserves  the timing of capital expenditures  and other costs associated with acquiring or obtaining other rights to switching and other transmission facilities  and costs associated with changes in staffing levels of sales  marketing  technical support and administrative personnel 
in addition  the company s operating results can vary due to factors such as changes in routing due to variations in the quality of vendor transmission capability  loss of favorable routing options  the amount of  and the accounting policy for  return traffic under operating agreements  actions by domestic or foreign regulatory entities  the level  timing and pace of the company s expansion in international and commercial markets  and general domestic and international economic and political conditions 
further  a substantial portion of transmission capacity used by the company is obtained on a variable  per minute and short term basis  subjecting the company to the possibility of unanticipated price increases and service cancellations 
since the company does not generally have long term arrangements for the purchase or resale of long distance services  and since rates fluctuate significantly over short periods of time  the company s operating results may vary significantly 
as the company s equipment group increases its number of telecommunications product offerings  its future operating results may vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing and shipment of significant orders  new product offerings by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of the company s products  changes in pricing policies by the company and its competitors  the availability of new technologies  the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold  the inability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for the company s products  gains or losses of significant customers  the timing of customers upgrade and expansion programs  changes in the level of operating expenses  the timing of acquisitions  seasonality and general economic conditions

this information has been prepared on a basis consistent with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring accruals  that the company considers necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

in connection with the nact merger  the company revalued purchased in process r d to reflect the current status of in process nact technology and related business forecasts and to ensure compliance with the additional guidance provided by the securities and exchange commission in its september  letter to the american institute of certified public accountants 
the revalued amount approximated the million expensed in connection with the nact acquisition  therefore no additional charge was recorded for purchased in process r d 
however  the effect of the revaluation required the company to reduce the first quarter charge related to the purchased in process r d by million and record an additional charge of million in the fourth quarter as of the date of the nact merger

year issue the turn of the century  year  poses a serious challenge for information technology it used by virtually every corporation around the world 
the problem arises as a result of past standard industry practices to store year date data in a digit yy field  instead of a digit ccyy format where the first digits cc represent the century and the last digits yy represent the year 
thus  in the two digit format  is stored as this causes programs that perform arithmetic operations  comparisons  or date sorts to possibly generate erroneous results when the program is required to process dates from both centuries 
the absence of the century information adds an ambiguity to the date information stored or processed by the program  and it may also cause problems with data entry and display screens 
the problem is further complicated because many applications are not stand alone  but interface with one or more applications

items associated with critical or moderate risk are addressed with highest priority 
similarly  a risk assessment is made for the customers  suppliers and service providers identified 
this phase includes contacting suppliers or manufacturers for information regarding their year readiness  technical review of products and systems  and compliance testing 
the necessary actions to bring each item into compliance are determined  and remediation costs are estimated 
to address potential problems  contingency plans are developed as necessary 
this phase has been completed in most areas of the company and is expected to be completed before the end of april information received from manufacturers and suppliers is maintained in databases to monitor compliance status  and compliance testing has been completed for most company products 
the third phase involves the remediation for items found to be non year compliant 
this involves replacement of equipment or upgrading of software or hardware 
this phase includes communications with the company s customers and suppliers to determine year issues as appropriate 
verification testing is done to ensure the effectiveness of the remediation efforts 
capital assets found to be non compliant have been  or will be replaced or remediated in this phase 
this phase is expected to be completed in the second quarter of most of the company s internally controlled software has been remediated and verified 
integrated testing also known as end to end testing is planned and should expose unforeseen compliance problems associated with system interfaces and dependencies
