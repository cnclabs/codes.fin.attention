year readiness disclosure the company has been evaluating and adjusting all known date sensitive systems and equipment for year compliance 
the assessment phase of the year project is complete 
all of the required coding conversions on information technology have been substantially completed 
the final phase of the company s year project  complete system testing  is ongoing and will continue until january  testing will continue for all existing systems and ongoing new releases and enhancements to ensure readiness 
the total estimated cost of the conversion was not significant  and continues to be handled in due course by the company s mis department 
these costs are an immaterial part of the company s information technology budget 
the company s information systems division has not deferred any information technology projects to address the year issue 
in addition to internal year implementation activities  the company is communicating with others with which our systems interface or on which they rely to determine the extent to which those companies are addressing their year compliance 
testing is ongoing and will continue through december there can be no assurance that there will not be an adverse effect on the company if third parties  such as utility companies or merchandise suppliers  do not convert their systems in a timely manner and in a way that is compatible with the company s systems 
however  management believes that ongoing communication with and assessment of these third parties will minimize these risks 
although the company anticipates minimal business disruption will occur as a result of year issues  possible consequences include  but are not limited to  loss of communications links with certain store locations  loss of electric power  inability to process transactions  send purchase orders  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company has established a contingency plan for possible year issues

the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including the timing of new store openings and acquisitions and unexpected changes in volume related rebates or changes in cooperative advertising policies from manufacturers 
in addition  operating results may be negatively affected by increases in merchandise costs  price changes in response to competitive factors and unfavorable local  regional or national economic developments that result in reduced consumer spending
