in august  the company acquired emass  inc in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the operating results of emass  now operated as adic denver and adic grau have been included since the date of the acquisition 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales in fiscal year increased to million compared with net sales of million in fiscal year the increase in net sales relates both to an increase in sales of small libraries and to the inclusion of emass sales in the fourth quarter of the year 
the increase in small library sales is due in part to the company s oem sales under agreements entered into during the fiscal year 
these oem sales consisted primarily of the faststor products introduced in the final quarter of fiscal the transition during the year of dlt tape drives  supplied by quantum  from a condition of supply constraint to one of general availability resulted in a reduction in the company s sales of standalone dlt tape drives and a reduction in sales to the company s distributors and resellers as they reduced their inventories 
in addition  the company lowered prices on certain library and other products  further decreasing sales dollars 
sales to the company s top two customers were of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal year international sales were million in fiscal  accounting for of net sales in both fiscal years and gross profit 
gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal the decrease is the result of many factors including higher overhead associated with the new redmond facility  increases in personnel to support the oem business  and lower than anticipated product revenues  particularly in the third quarter 
it is further decreased by the effect of certain product price reductions 
these factors more than offset the benefit of the shift in product mix toward higher margin libraries and away from lower margin standalone products 
the gross profit percentage in the fourth quarter benefited from the larger libraries and software sales of emass but also reflected a  charge to cost of goods sold as a result of purchase accounting adjustments to record emass acquired inventory at its fair market value 
gross profit margins are dependent on a number of factors  including customer and product mix  price competition and tape drive costs 
there can be no assurance that the company can improve upon or maintain it s current gross margin levels  given that tape drives purchased from third party suppliers are a significant component of the company s product costs 
selling and administrative expenses 
sales and administrative expenses in fiscal were million or of sales  compared with million or of sales in fiscal year the increase is due in part to the inclusion of emass expenses from august to october   but also to an increase in costs in the previous adic business 
this increase related to increased sales personnel in the headquarters  regional and international sales offices  increased advertising and promotion costs and also increased costs associated with the new headquarters facility 
in addition  the acquisition of emass caused the company to have certain duplicative assets 
these assets consequently were written off subsequent to the acquisition 
acquired in process technology 
in connection with the purchase of emass  the existence of acquired in process technology was determined and valued by an independent third party appraisal 
the value associated with this intangible asset  million  was expensed immediately 
this valuation is based upon estimates by the company and actual results may change 
if the estimate of the in process technology were to decrease  the value assigned to property  plant and equipment and intangible and other assets acquired would increase 
the company expects to incur significant costs to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products 
such expenses subsequent to august are included in research and development expenses 
see risk factors acquired in process technology 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million or of net sales for the year ended october  compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases are both related to emass which has significant expenditures associated with both hardware and software in process technology 
the company expects that research and development expenses in fiscal will be significantly greater both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales than previously recorded 
other income expense 
interest income of million for fiscal was comparable to fiscal interest income of million 
interest expense incurred in fiscal of  represented interest from august to october  on a bank loan  the proceeds of which were used to finance the acquisition of emass 
the gain on sale of marketable securities relates to investments in certain equity securities made and sold in fiscal foreign currency gains or losses arise as a result of the operation of the company s european subsidiaries  adic europe and grau  the functional currencies of which are the french franc and german deutsche mark  respectively 
all monetary assets are translated into the functional currencies on the financial statements of adic europe and grau 
adic europe buys products from adic in us dollars and resells a significant majority of such products in us dollars 
grau both buys and sells products to emass in us dollars 
grau s sales are primarily in deutsche marks  the sales of its subsidiaries in uk and france  which act as sales offices in those countries  are made primarily in british pound sterling and french francs  respectively 
certain of the us dollar receivables and payables in these entities offset 
to the extent that these monetary assets and liabilities do not fully offset each other and the us dollar exchange rate changes with respect to these currencies  transaction gains or losses may result 
for large sales denominated in other currencies  the company attempts to implement appropriate hedging strategies 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
the expense associated with the write off of acquired in process technology is not deductible for state or federal income tax purposes 
without this expense  the effective tax rate would be 
there are significant deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards and other timing differences of emass and grau 
a valuation allowance has been established on these deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that the deferred assets related to emass and grau will not be realized 
in the event that future earnings of these companies allows the company to deduct these expenses for tax purposes and recognize these assets  the company will reallocate the purchase price to reduce noncurrent intangible assets related to the acquisition 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended october  increased to million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in net sales was due primarily to strong unit sales volume of the company s dlt based products  particularly the vls dlt and scalar automated tape libraries  and the ds series standalone tape drives 
net sales of older products  including mm dat and mm tape libraries decreased in fiscal the company reduced its prices on selected products at various times throughout the year

the cost of direct material  specifically the dlt tape drives  comprised a substantial majority of cost of sales in both fiscal and selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for the year ended october  compared to million or of net sales for fiscal selling and administrative expenses for the year ended october  decreased as a percentage of net sales as increased net sales reflected the benefits of the company s significant investments in sales and marketing resources in fiscal years and net sales volume in the fiscal year increased compared to a corresponding increase in selling and administrative expenses 
the dollar increase in selling and administrative expenses over fiscal was primarily due to additions to sales and marketing staff  increased advertising costs and increased administrative overhead 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million or of net sales for the year ended october  compared to million or of net sales for fiscal actual dollar spending during fiscal was higher than fiscal due to increases in development expenses for the faststor products released in the final quarter of fiscal as well as the scalar series  and additions to research and engineering staff

at october   adic had a million bank line of credit that expires in february  all of which was available 
any borrowings under this line of credit would bear interest at the bank s reference prime rate or adjusted libor rate 
the company had no material or unusual commitments as of october  other than annual rental commitments 
the company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and bank line of credit  together with the results of operations  will be sufficient to fund its working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
the company may utilize cash to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that it believes are strategic 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 
however  the company has no present understanding  commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisition of other businesses  products or technologies 
year the company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in existing computer systems and the inability of many of these products to distinguish between twentieth century dates and twenty first century dates to determine the applicable year 
this error could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the company is actively assessing the impact of the upcoming change on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
based on the company s assessment to date  the company believes the current versions of its software and hardware products and services are year compliant 
new products are being designed to be year compliant 
while most of the company s internally manufactured library products have no date functionality built into them  this is not true for certain software and large library products 
year compliant updates are available for most of these products  those that are currently unavailable are scheduled for release early in the company is reviewing hardware used in connection with its products for those customers with current service maintenance contracts 
plans exist to replace certain systems that can not be made compliant and upgrade those that can 
there can be no assurance  however  that all existing company products will contain all necessary date codes 
further  use of the company s products in connection with other products which are not year compliant  including non compliant hardware  software and firmware may result in the inaccurate exchange of dates and result in performance problems or system failure 
any failure of the company s products to perform could result in claims against the company 
the cost of defending any such claim which may arise  as well as any liability of the company for year related damages could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s business depends on numerous systems that could potentially be impacted by year related problems 
the company is assessing the possible effects on the company s operations of the year readiness of its enterprise resource planning computer systems and other internal systems 
the company believes that the enterprise resource planning computer systems at its various manufacturing sites are either year compliant currently or can be modified to ensure compliance 
other internal systems are currently being assessed  and based on such assessment the company will modify or replace such systems 
the company expects the assessments and tests of these systems to be completed in mid the company s reliance on key suppliers  and therefore on the proper function of their information systems and software  means that their failure to address year issues could have a material impact on the company s operations and financial results 
the company has asked key suppliers to provide information regarding their readiness for year related issues 
the company is reviewing the responses and will determine what further actions are required to mitigate vulnerability to problems with suppliers and other third parties systems 
the company expects to incur primarily internal staff cost and other expenses related to infrastructure and facilities enhancements necessary to prepare the systems for year to date there have been no material direct out of pocket costs 
although the total cost of these year compliance activities is not yet determined  it is not anticipated to be material to the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company has not completed a contingency plan for handling year problems that are not detected and corrected prior to their occurrence 
any failure of the company to address any unforeseen year issue could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations
