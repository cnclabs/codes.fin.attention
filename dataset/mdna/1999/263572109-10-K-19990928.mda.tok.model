such computer systems will be unable to interpret dates beyond the year  which could cause a system failure or other computer errors  leading to disruptions in operations 
in  the company developed a three phase program for yk compliance 
phase i is the identification of those systems through which the company has exposure to yk issues

the non compliant system is scheduled for upgrade by october all the informational systems are scheduled for final testing by november to ensure yk compliance 
should the informational systems continue to be non compliant after testing  the information can be obtained in a less efficient manner
