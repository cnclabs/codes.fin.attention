management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following sets forth certain factors that have affected the company s results of operations and management believes may continue to affect the company in the future 
the company defines its fiscal year as the period in which most of the business activity occurs eg  the year ending february  is referred to as fiscal 
prior expansion strategy strouds expanded into markets outside of its core california markets during through the company opened superstores in the greater chicago  minneapolis and washington  dc markets and nevada 
these stores averaged over  square feet and were approximately larger than the company s average california superstores 
these new superstores carried expanded product lines and new merchandise categories including housewares 
the majority of these stores experienced high occupancy and operating costs as a result of low sales volume 
as a result of the poor operating results of these stores in particular  the company suspended its expansion into new markets outside of california and announced a restructuring plan  in part  for the purpose of closing underperforming stores in its expansion markets 
as of february   the company has closed stores in the greater chicago and minneapolis markets and each in the washington  dc and nevada markets  commenced closing its remaining store in the washington  dc market and plans to close more store in the greater chicago market 
the company has continued a strategy to expand in its core california markets 
this expansion strategy consists of strategic in filling with new stores  relocations of existing stores to adjust to demographic shifts and store expansions to meet increasing demands 
for its fiscal year ended february   the company opened superstore and outlet store in monterey and san jose  california  respectively 
the continued store development activity in california has from time to time negatively impacted the sales of existing strouds stores 
management believes that the benefits of strengthening its market presence and adjusting to demographic shifts in the california market have generally outweighed the reduced sales impact experienced by an existing strouds store that may share a particular trade area 
restructuring and asset impairment primarily as a result of the factors noted above  the company initiated a comprehensive restructuring and cost reduction plan the restructuring page plan  resulting in a pretax charge of million in fiscal the restructuring plan is designed to improve the operating performance of the company through the closure or disposition of certain underperforming stores  elimination of underperforming merchandise categories and implementation of cost reduction measures  including workforce reductions  to more closely align the company s cost structure with future expected revenues 
since the initiation of the restructuring plan  the company has closed stores in its expansion markets noted above and stores in california as of february  the company plans to close additional stores in its expansion markets as noted above 
cash used in fiscal related to the restructuring plan of million was primarily related to lease termination costs  teardown expenses  consulting and advisory expenses and employee severance and related costs 
as of february   no changes had been made to the estimated restructuring plan costs and no charges were recorded to operations 
the restructuring plan has been substantially completed 
the remaining liability is primarily for the closure of stores  of which the closure terms have yet to be determined 
during fiscal  the company recorded a pretax charge of million for the impairment of certain operating assets 
the principal factors leading up to the charge were current and future operating losses on individual operating assets  whereby the carrying value of certain operating assets exceeded the current estimate of future cash flows from the related assets 
in fiscal and fiscal  the company had no additional charges for asset impairment 
the company will continually evaluate the performance of its operating assets for the factors noted above and  if conditions warrant  write down the value of such assets commensurate with the current and estimated future operating performance 
future expansion the company has substantially completed its restructuring efforts  made changes to a number of merchandise categories its stores will carry  improved the physical layout to more visually stimulate the customer  modified the use of advertising media and increased the frequency of sale events 
the combination of these efforts has resulted in improved operating performance for most of the company s stores 
additionally  the revision to the stores merchandise categories will result in a scaled down store size which management believes is more economically efficient 
as a result  management believes that it is now positioned to expand outside of california in a more effective manner than in its previous expansion efforts 
this expansion will primarily occur  over the next three years  in markets that are contiguous or in proximity of its core california markets 
management believes that it can better leverage the strouds name in these markets 
while this name recognition will assist in supporting the introduction of the strouds stores  the geographic proximity to california will offer logistical economies in terms of distribution and management

this included a pretax charge of million for a comprehensive restructuring plan 
during fiscal  the company closed locations and finalized plans to close additional locations in fiscal management continues to evaluate the remaining underperforming stores contemplated in the restructuring plan and will continue to operate these stores  where appropriate  in the current format or  if circumstances warrant  convert to an outlet format in order to improve cash flow and minimize the ultimate cost of disposition

interest expense  net  increased million to million for fiscal versus million in fiscal interest expense increased as a result of higher average outstanding borrowings and a higher cost of capital during fiscal the higher average balances resulted from borrowings in fiscal for working capital and new store development activities which were outstanding for the entire year in fiscal versus a partial year in fiscal the company recognized a tax benefit for fiscal of million versus million for the same period a year ago 
the income tax benefit for fiscal is due to the carryback of current year tax losses to prior years resulting in a refund of prior years income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company entered into a new revolving credit agreement with a new lender the credit facility and commenced borrowings under the credit facility 
concurrently  the company s previous revolving credit facility was paid off and terminated 
the borrowing limit under this credit facility is the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of of eligible inventory or of appraised net liquidation value of inventory 
the company s capital requirements are primarily for inventory purchases  store expansion and refurbishment activities and systems development 
the company has historically financed its operations primarily with internally generated funds and its credit facility 
at february   the company s working capital was million  while advances from its credit facility were million 
the company had million available for borrowings under its credit facility as determined by the company s eligible borrowing base  as described above  at february  page net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million versus million in fiscal cash flows from operating activities increased by million primarily due to the improved operating performance for fiscal versus fiscal during fiscal  inventory decreased million as a result of operating less store than at the end of fiscal  inventory liquidations and improved inventory management

net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million 
net cash used was for capital expenditures consisting of new store openings  improvements to its distribution and warehouse facility  management information systems development and existing store refurbishments and remodels 
the company s capital expenditures for fiscal are currently expected to be approximately million related primarily to new store development  existing store expansions and refurbishments and improvements to its management information systems 
management believes that funds generated from operations  its credit facility and use of trade credit will be sufficient to satisfy the company s working capital requirements and commitments for capital expenditures through fiscal net cash used in financing activities for fiscal of million was primarily attributable to the timing of vendor payments 
year the company has conducted a comprehensive review of its computer systems to identify those systems that could be affected by the year or yk issue and has developed an implementation plan to resolve the issue 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the year issue is believed to affect virtually all companies and organizations  including the company 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a major system failure or miscalculations 
the company is reliant on computer based technology and utilizes a variety of proprietary and third party applications 
the company s retail functions  such as merchandise procurement and distribution  inventory control and point of sale transactions  generally use third party applications  with proprietary additions to fit unique business requirements 
failure in these key areas could impact the company s ability to transact business in an efficient manner 
the company is also dependent on a number of key vendors using similar technology for ongoing timely and consistent delivery of page merchandise to support retail operations 
a significant disruption in the flow of key items into stores could also negatively impact results 
to a much lesser degree  the company also relies on certain imbedded processor systems for communications  security and other basic process control functions  the complete failure of which could also impact operations 
in fiscal  the company spent approximately million for the purpose of installing new merchandise  distribution and financial software 
this major effort included complete replacement of the previously used mainframe computer systems and modified third party software with yk certified hardware and software in fiscal as well as upgrading all in store point of sale computer systems to be yk compliant 
these efforts have been substantially completed with installation and testing of the mainframe systems for merchandising  accounting  distribution and inventory control prior to the end of fiscal  and the completion of the in store system upgrades which will be installed in every retail store in the first quarter of fiscal the company anticipates spending approximately million in fiscal for additional upgrades to these systems 
arrangements with other key providers for payroll  voice and data communications  credit card and check processing and non critical software packages are currently being completed to assure yk compatibility by july based upon the compliance levels of the critical software and hardware currently installed or being installed  the company expects to be fully compliant well in advance of the potential for business impact from the yk transition 
nonetheless  a formal reassessment based upon integrated simulation of all company systems will be undertaken in the second quarter of fiscal to verify readiness 
if the modifications and conversions to the company s computer systems are not completed in a timely manner  the year problem may have a material impact on the operations of the company 
such material impacts could require the company to manually record sales  issue purchases orders to suppliers  pay invoices from vendors and maintain its books and records for a period of time 
yk compliance of the company s key vendors has been assessed through individual surveys completed in fiscal  and will be tested in the first quarter of fiscal with electronic data interchange transmission of yk specific order and financial information 
an assessment of potential problem relationships will be reviewed in the second quarter of fiscal for further follow up activity 
the company expects to deal with any remaining at risk systems or supplier issues and develop appropriate contingency plans in the third quarter of fiscal these contingency plans may include such actions as making alternate supplier arrangements  rescheduling deliveries  or utilizing alternate methods of operation during this critical period 
notwithstanding that the company has been proceeding diligently with the implementation of its own compliance program  including aspects thereof directed to ascertaining year compliance by third parties  there can be no assurance that the company s operations will not experience disruptions due to the failure of third parties including software  data processing  and other vendors with which the company has commercial relationships to become fully year compliant in a timely manner 
in the worst case  the company page may experience extensive delays in merchandise shipments from suppliers and therefore experience high levels of out of stock goods in its stores 
such out of stock scenarios could have a material impact on sales and related profits for an unspecified period of time and accordingly  cause an adverse change in the company s stock price to occur 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had or will have a material adverse effect on net sales or results of operations 
the company has generally been able to pass on increased costs through increases in selling prices 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations 
historically  the company has realized a higher portion of its net sales and an even greater proportion of its profits in the months of november  december and january 
additionally  the timing of promotional events may affect the company s results in different quarters from year to year 
the company may encounter different seasonality factors as it enters new markets outside of california 
the timing of new store openings and related preopening expenses  and the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  may also cause the company s quarterly results of operations to fluctuate 
cautionary statement for purposes of safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not related to historical results are forward looking statements 
the statements are made a number of times throughout the document and may be identified by such forward looking terminology as expect  believe  may  will  intend or similar statements or variations of such terms 
actual results may differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward looking statements 
further  certain forward looking statements are based upon assumptions of future events which may not prove to be accurate 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including levels of sales  store traffic  acceptance of product offering and fashions  competitive pressures from other superstore retailers and from department stores which carry other products including certain designer products not carried by the company s stores  availability of future store locations and schedule of store expansion plans 
these and other important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements are more fully described in item  part i of the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended february  you are urged to consider such factors 
the company assumes no obligation for updating any such forward looking statements 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s million credit facility has interest payable at a rate equivalent to the chase manhattan bank rate plus per annum or libor plus per annum and at february   respectively 
changes in interest rates which dramatically increase the interest rate on the credit facility would make it more costly to borrow proceeds under that facility and may impede the company s growth strategies if management determines that the costs associated with borrowing funds are too high to implement these strategies 
the company does not hold derivative investments and does not earn foreign source income 
all of the company s revenues are realized in dollars and almost all of the revenues are from customers in the united states 
therefore  the company does not believe that it has any significant direct foreign currency exchange risk
