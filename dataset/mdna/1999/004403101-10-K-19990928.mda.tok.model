the significant variations in revolving advances and money order principal payable result from the company s use  in mid december  of financing through the bank credit facilities described below in liquidity and capital resources instead of financing through deferred money order remittances

there can be no assurance  however  that the anticipated renewal will be effected 
if no such renewal is effected  the company will have to obtain financing from other sources  and that financing might be on terms less favorable to the company than those set forth in the credit agreement
