general since  sales have increased by million to million  a compound annual growth rate of  while comparable department sales have increased by  and in  and  respectively 
comparable department sales include departments open for the same months during comparable periods 
domestic comparable department sales during this same period increased  and 
the increase in total sales during this period is the result of i adding net new departments and stand alone stores  including departments from the diamond park acquisition  and ii increasing comparable department sales 
management attributes its comparable department sales increases during this period to the following company initiatives i introducing its key item and best value merchandising programs  which provide a targeted assortment of items at competitive prices  ii increasing focus on holiday and event driven promotions as well as host store marketing programs  iii positioning the company s departments as a destination location for fine jewelry  and iv implementing project prism promptly reduce inefficiencies and sales multiply  a program designed to allow finlay s sales associates more time for customer sales and service 
gross margin as a percentage of sales has decreased from in to in this decrease is principally the result of the company s key item and best value programs  which produce higher sales volume and a slightly lower gross margin  on average  than other merchandise  and the integration of the former diamond park departments at a lower gross margin offset  in  by the favorable impact of the lifo method of inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of sales have decreased from in to in management attributes this improvement to i leveraging operating expenses through higher domestic sales and ii reducing the level of certain operating expenses through the ongoing implementation of project prism 
in  the favorable sg a improvement was offset by additional expenses relating to the central distribution facility during its initial start up phase and expenses associated with the company s year remediation project 
in addition  the leveraging of operating expenses was negatively impacted as a result of the slowdown of sales in france in the components of sg a include payroll expense  lease fees  net advertising expenditures and other field and administrative expenses 
as a result of the recapitalization and the leveraged recapitalization each as defined in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is highly leveraged and  as such  interest expense had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
the refinancing resulted in lower interest rates on the senior debentures and the senior notes than the interest rates on the old debentures and the old notes 
as such  for the period subsequent to the retirement of the old debt  interest expense has been favorably impacted as compared to the company also records approximately million of goodwill amortization annually resulting primarily from the leveraged recapitalization and the diamond park acquisition 
finlay entered the international fine jewelry retailing market in october by acquiring sonab  which as of january  operated departments and three stand alone stores  principally in france 
in the second quarter of  sonab began to experience lower sales trends due to the transition from a promotional pricing strategy to an everyday low price strategy 
this change was made as a result of sonab reassessing its pricing policy following certain local french court decisions 
the adverse impact of such change continued through and is expected to continue at least through the third quarter of diamond park acquisition on october   finlay completed the acquisition of certain assets of diamond park  a leading operator of departments  for approximately million 
by acquiring diamond park  finlay added departments that  in  contributed in excess of million in sales and also added new host store relationships with marshall field s  parisian and dillard s formerly the mercantile stores 
management believes that  in addition to increasing sales volume  the diamond park acquisition will continue to improve finlay s results of operations through the leveraging of expenses and the achievement of other operating synergies

sales from the operation of net new departments contributed million  primarily due to the acquisition of the former diamond park departments

gross margin 
gross margin increased by million in compared to  however  as a percentage of sales  gross margin decreased by  primarily due to i management s efforts to increase market penetration and market share through its pricing strategy and ii lower gross margins experienced by the former diamond park departments  particularly as the merchandise acquired as part of the diamond park acquisition continued to be sold in during  the company benefited from a decrease in the lifo provision of million  which was lower than the benefit in of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a totaled million  an increase of million  or  in compared to due primarily to payroll expense and lease fees associated with the increase in the company s sales 
the increased sales generated by the former diamond park departments and strong domestic comparable department sales enabled the company to leverage administrative and certain other expenses

the increase in average borrowings is a result of an increase in the outstanding balance of the old debentures prior to the redemption date  due to the accretion of interest and additional indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit agreement adjusted to exclude the timing impact of the call requirements on the old debentures and the old notes  discussed below 
nonrecurring interest associated with refinancing

liquidity and capital resources finlay s primary capital requirements are for funding working capital for new departments and for working capital growth of existing departments and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures for opening new departments  renovating existing departments and information technology investments 
for  capital expenditures totaled million and in totaled million  which included construction costs related to the company s central distribution facility 
total capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million 
although capital expenditures are limited by the terms of the revolving credit agreement  to date this limitation has not precluded the company from satisfying its capital expenditure requirements 
finlay s operations substantially preclude customer receivables and in recent years  on average  approximately of finlay s domestic merchandise has been carried on consignment 
accordingly  management believes that relatively modest levels of working capital are required in comparison to many other retailers 
the company s working capital balance was million at january   an increase of million from january  the increase resulted primarily from the impact of s net income exclusive of depreciation and amortization  the recording of an income tax receivable relating to the prepayment of accreted interest on the old debentures  the net proceeds to the company from the offering and the sale of the senior debentures and the senior notes  partially offset by the use of such proceeds to prepay the old debentures and the old notes and capital expenditures 
based on the seasonal nature of finlay s business  working capital requirements and therefore borrowings under the revolving credit agreement can be expected to increase on an interim basis during the first three quarters of any given fiscal year 
see seasonality 
the seasonality of finlay s business causes working capital requirements to reach their highest level in the months of october  november and december in anticipation of the year end holiday season 
accordingly  finlay experiences seasonal cash needs as inventory levels peak 
the revolving credit agreement provides finlay with a line of credit of up to million to finance working capital needs 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to  at finlay s option  i the index rate as defined in the revolving credit agreement plus a margin ranging from zero to or ii adjusted libor plus a margin ranging from to  in each case depending on the financial performance of the company 
in each year  finlay is required to reduce the outstanding revolving credit balance and letter of credit balance under the revolving credit agreement to million or less and million or less  respectively  for a consecutive day period the balance reduction requirement 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at january  and january  were zero 
the average amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement for and were million and million adjusted for the impact of the temporary paydown of the revolving credit facility due to certain call requirements associated with the old debentures and the old notes  respectively 
the maximum amount outstanding for was million 
significant additional working capital has not been required with respect to the operation of the former diamond park departments because finlay purchased the inventory of the diamond park departments 
inventory purchases for the former diamond park departments will continue to be financed in part by trade payables combined with an increased utilization of consignment inventory compared to the amount of consignment merchandise on hand at the time of the diamond park acquisition 
as such  management believes that working capital requirements for the former diamond park departments have been reduced as compared to the amount of working capital required at the time of the diamond park acquisition 
finlay s long term needs for external financing will depend on its rate of growth  the level of internally generated funds and the ability to continue obtaining substantial amounts of merchandise on advantageous terms  including consignment arrangements with its vendors 
as of january   million of consignment merchandise from approximately vendors was on hand as compared to million at january  for  finlay had an average balance of consignment merchandise of million as compared to an average balance of million in see business store relationships and business purchasing and inventory 
a substantial amount of finlay s operating cash flow has been used or will be required to pay  directly or indirectly  interest with respect to the old debentures  the old notes  the senior debentures  the senior notes and amounts due under the revolving credit agreement  including the payments required pursuant to the balance reduction requirement 
as of january   finlay s outstanding borrowings were million  which included a million balance under the senior debentures and a million balance under the senior notes 
on may   the company prepaid all of the million of accreted interest on the old debentures as of such date 
the company exercised its option to prepay all such accreted interest to take advantage of the resulting tax benefit relating to the deductibility of such prepayment in in addition  on may   finlay redeemed the outstanding principal amounts  including associated premiums  of the old debentures and the old notes 
finlay funded the prepayment and the redemptions using the proceeds from the sale of the senior debentures  the offering and the sale of the senior notes  together with other available funds 
in connection with the redemption of the old debentures and the old notes  the company recorded a pre tax nonrecurring charge of approximately million  including million for redemption premiums and million to write off deferred financing and debt discount costs associated with the old debentures and the old notes 
finlay jewelry is party to the gold consignment agreement  which expires on december  the gold consignment agreement enables finlay jewelry to receive merchandise by providing gold  or otherwise making payment  to certain vendors 
finlay jewelry can obtain  pursuant to the gold consignment agreement  up to the lesser of i  fine troy ounces or ii million worth of gold  subject to a formula as prescribed by the gold consignment agreement 
at january   amounts outstanding under the gold consignment agreement totaled  fine troy ounces  valued at approximately million 
the average amount outstanding under the gold consignment agreement was million in many of finlay s existing computer systems  software products  other systems using embedded chips non information technology systems and third party systems  accept only two entries in the date field to distinguish the year 
beginning in the year  these date fields will need to accept four digit entries  or properly handle two digit entries  to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  finlay s date critical functions may be adversely affected unless the computer systems and software products of both finlay and significant third parties are or become year compliant 
a comprehensive plan is being executed to ensure that all systems critical to the operation of the company are year compliant 
the plan is structured into five primary phases identification  assessment  remediation  testing and implementation 
the company has completed the identification and assessment phases of all critical components and is in the remediation phase 
the company expects that the testing and implementation phases of all internal systems  including its non information technology systems  will be completed by august finlay is using  and will continue to use  a combination of internal and external resources to execute its year project plan 
the company has estimated that the costs related to its year efforts will total approximately million  of which approximately million was spent in finlay will incur the balance of these costs during and will fund such costs through operating cash flows 
during  the company began formal communications with all of its host stores  vendors and other third parties in an effort to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to the failure of their systems and to obtain year compliance certification 
to date  none of the third parties that have responded have raised any year issues which the company believes would have a material adverse effect on finlay 
the company will continue this communication process during management expects that with the successful implementation of the year project  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems 
there can be no assurance  however  that finlay s systems and software will be rendered year compliant in a timely manner  or that finlay will not incur significant unforeseen additional expenses to ensure such compliance 
the consequences of a disruption of the company s operations  whether caused by the company s internal systems or those of any significant third party  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the likely worst case scenario may be an inability to distribute merchandise to the company s departments and to process its daily business for some period of time 
the lost revenues  if any  resulting from a worst case scenario would depend on the time period in which the failure goes uncorrected and the difficulty to remediate such failure 
management recognizes the importance of developing a contingency plan in the event of a year failure  the development of which is in progress and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of the company is currently gathering data in an effort to assess the potential effects on the company s mission critical functions of a failure of the company s year plan to be fully effective and  to the extent deemed appropriate  to address such effects 
in addition  progress reports on the year project are presented regularly to senior management and the company s board of directors 
during  the company began several information technology initiatives  including the design and development of a new merchandising system and the upgrade of point of sale systems and related hardware in the majority of finlay s departments 
these projects will serve to support future growth of the company as well as provide improved analysis and reporting capabilities and are expected to be completed in mid the cost associated with these projects is estimated to be million for software and implementation costs  to be included in deferred charges and other assets  and approximately million for hardware and related equipment  to be included as a component of the company s capital expenditures and reflected in fixed assets 
at january   approximately million was expended and included in deferred charges and other assets 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code restricts utilization of net operating loss nols carryforwards after an ownership change exceeding 
as a result of the recapitalization  a change in ownership of the company exceeding occurred within the meaning of section of the code 
similar restrictions apply to other carryforwards 
consequently  there is a material limitation on the company s annual utilization of its nols and other carryforwards which requires a deferral or loss of the utilization of such nols or other carryforwards 
the company had  at october  the company s tax year end  a nol for tax purposes of approximately million which is subject to an annual limit of approximately million per year 
however  for financial reporting purposes  no nol exists as of january  from time to time  finlay enters into futures contracts  such as options or forwards  based upon the anticipated sales of gold product in order to hedge against the risk arising from its payment arrangements 
changes in the market value of futures contracts are accounted for as an addition to or reduction from the inventory cost 
for the year ended january   the gain or loss on open futures contracts was not material 
the company did not have any open positions in futures contracts for gold at january  there can be no assurance that these hedging techniques will be successful or that hedging transactions will not adversely affect the company s results of operations or financial position 
finlay believes that  based upon current operations  anticipated growth  and availability under the revolving credit agreement  finlay jewelry will  for the foreseeable future  be able to meet its debt service and anticipated working capital obligations  and to make distributions to the company sufficient to permit the company to meet its debt service obligations and to pay certain other expenses as they come due 
no assurances  however  can be given that finlay jewelry s current level of operating results will continue or improve or that finlay jewelry s income from operations will continue to be sufficient to permit finlay jewelry and the company to meet their debt service and other obligations 
currently  finlay jewelry s principal financing arrangements restrict annual distributions from finlay jewelry to the company to of finlay jewelry s net sales for the preceding fiscal year and also allow distributions to the company to enable it to make interest payments on the senior debentures 
the amounts required to satisfy the aggregate of finlay jewelry s interest expense and required amortization payments totaled million and million for and  respectively 
seasonality finlay s business is highly seasonal  with a significant portion of its sales and income from operations generated during the fourth quarter of each year  which includes the year end holiday season 
the fourth quarter accounted for an average of of finlay s sales and of its income from operations for  and finlay has typically experienced net losses in the first three quarters of its fiscal year 
during these periods  working capital requirements have been funded by borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
accordingly  the results for any of the first three quarters of any given fiscal year  taken individually or in the aggregate  are not indicative of annual results 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of the company
