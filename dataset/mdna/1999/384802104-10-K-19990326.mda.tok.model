year the company uses various software and technology that is affected by the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or in miscalculations causing disruptions to operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  to send invoices to customers  or to engage in similar normal business activities 
the year issue affects virtually all companies and organizations 
the company has put in place project teams dedicated to implementing a year solution and to improving the company s overall systems capabilities 
the teams are actively working to achieve the objectives of year compliance and improved internal systems 
the work includes the modification of certain existing systems  a major new system initiative  replacing hardware and software for other systems  the creation of contingency plans  and surveying suppliers of goods and services with whom the company does business 
in addition to solving some year issues  the major new system initiative reduces the complexity which has evolved over time from the development of in house systems 
this complexity  which makes it difficult to change and modify systems quickly  has resulted in a proliferation of programs and databases 
these issues will be addressed by the installation of a new business enterprise system to replace a majority of the company s primary operating systems 
this major system initiative has been undertaken to improve the company s ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions  to reduce the cost of maintaining and supporting existing systems  and to leverage the use of information 
the company is using a standard methodology with three phases for the year compliance project 
phase i includes conducting a complete inventory of potentially affected areas of the business including information technology and non information technology  assessing and prioritizing the information collected during the inventory  and completing detailed project plans to address all key areas of the project 
phase ii includes the remediation and testing of all mission critical areas of the project  surveying suppliers of goods and services with whom the company does business  and the creation of contingency plans to address potential year related problems 
phase iii of the project includes the remediation and testing of non mission critical areas of the project  and the implementation of contingency plans as may be necessary 
the company completed phase i 
phase ii and phase iii are in process 
the company is using both internal and external resources to reprogram  replace  and test the software and hardware for year compliance 
year work for mission critical and most non mission critical systems and testing of all system revisions is planned to be completed in the third quarter of the expenses associated with this project include both a reallocation of existing internal resources plus the use of outside services 
project expenses for and amounted to an estimated million 
the total remaining expenses associated with the year project are estimated to be between and million 
due to the year project and the major new system initiative  data processing expenses were approximately million higher than expenses as adjusted for volume related charges 
the data processing expenses for are estimated to be a net to million higher than the expenses as adjusted for volume related changes 
it is expected that these projects will be funded through the company s operating cash flows 
in addition to addressing internal systems  the company s year project team has surveyed suppliers of goods and services with whom the company does business 
this is being done to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to failures by third parties to remediate their own year issues 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies  including those on which the company s systems interact  will be timely converted 
a failure to convert by another company on a timely basis or a conversion by another company that is incompatible with the company s systems  may have a material adverse effect on the company 
as part of phase ii of the year project  the company is creating contingency plans to address potential year related problems with key business processes 
these plans  which are scheduled to be completed and tested in the second quarter of  are expected to address risks to the company s systems as well as risks from third party suppliers  customers  and others with whom the company does business 
it is recognized that while the company cannot eliminate all potential risks  the effect of the risks on the business can be partially mitigated by creating and testing contingency plans where appropriate 
the estimated expenses for these projects and the dates by which the company will complete the year work are based on management s current assessment and were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans  and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved or that all components of year compliance will be addressed as planned 
uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and the sources and timeliness of various systems replacements 
management believes that failure to address the year issue on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the company and continues to be committed to devoting the appropriate resources to address the year issue 
financial condition working capital was  at december   compared with  at december   and  at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was   and at such dates 
net cash flows from operations of  in   in  and  in  have continued to improve the company s financial position and serve as the primary source of funding for capital requirements 
for information as to the company s cash flows  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
in each of the past three years  a portion of working capital has been used for additions to property  buildings  and equipment  and capitalized software as summarized in the following table 
in thousands of dollars land  buildings  structures  and improvements    furniture  fixtures  machinery  and equipment    capitalized software  total    on april   the company s board of directors voted to restore an existing share repurchase authorization to its original level of  shares 
the company repurchased  shares of its common stock during   shares of its common stock during  and  shares of its common stock during as of december   approximately  shares of common stock remain available under this repurchase authorization 
dividends paid to shareholders were  in   in  and  in on december   the company acquired agi for approximately  including transaction expenses 
the purchase consisted of cash payments and transaction expenses of  funded principally by short term debt of  and the issuance of  shares of ww grainger  inc common stock valued at  the company repurchased the  shares during  which is included in the  shares repurchased during internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and funds needed for expanding the business  supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated 
in addition to continuing facilities optimization efforts  business development  and systems and other infrastructure enhancements  funds are being expended for the consolidation of chicago area offices into the lake forest  illinois office facility currently being constructed 
the company continues to maintain a low debt ratio and strong liquidity position  which provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long term cash requirements 
in addition to internally generated funds  the company has various sources of financing available  including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit and otherwise 
total debt as a percent of shareholders equity was   and  at december    and  respectively 
inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not been a significant factor to operations 
the predominant use of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the primary financial statements 
the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements  where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost continues to be significant for these long lived assets 
the related depreciation expense associated with these assets increases significantly when adjusting for the cumulative effect of inflation 
the company believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  increasing working capital turnover  and offering products and services which can command proper price levels in the marketplace
