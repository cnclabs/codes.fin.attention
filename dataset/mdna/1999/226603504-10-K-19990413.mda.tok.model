item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis contains statements that may be considered forward looking 
these statements contain a number of risks and uncertainties as discussed herein and in item of this form k that could cause actual results to differ materially 
results of operations for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share data interest income subordinated cmbs    insured mortgage securities    originated loans  total interest income    interest and related expense    net interest margin    gain on sale of cmbs  equity in earnings from investments    other income    gain on mortgage securities dispositions    other operating expenses    amortization of assets acquired in the merger    realized loss on reverse repurchase obligation  unrealized losses on warehouse purchase obligations  write off of capitalized origination costs  reorganization items  net income before minority interest    minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary   dividends paid or accrued on preferred shares    net income available to common shareholders    adjustments to tax basis income see also note to notes to consolidated financial statements    tax basis income available to common shareholders    gaap basis income per share basic tax basis income per share versus interest income subordinated cmbs income from subordinated cmbs increased by approximately million  or  to million during as compared to million during during  the company increased its cmbs portfolio by acquiring subordinated cmbs at purchase prices aggregating approximately million during as compared to the million during this increase was partially offset by a reduction in income from subordinated cmbs due to the de recognition of million face amount of cmbs from cbo in connection with cbo and also the de recognition of million face amount of cmbs in connection with cbo see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that interest income generated by subordinated cmbs be recorded based on the effective interest method using the anticipated yield over the expected life of the subordinated cmbs 
this currently results in income which is lower for financial statement purposes than for tax purposes 
based upon the timing and amount of future credit losses and certain other assumptions estimated by management  as discussed below  the estimated weighted average anticipated unleveraged yield for criimi mae s subordinated cmbs for financial statement purposes as of december  and  was approximately and  respectively 
the decrease in anticipated unleveraged yield is primarily due to five subordinated cmbs acquisitions in with anticipated unleveraged yields between and which reduced the overall average of the cmbs portfolio 
these returns were determined based on the anticipated yield over the expected weighted average life of the subordinated cmbs  which considers  among other things  anticipated losses and interest expense attributable to the financing of the rated tranches at current interest rates and current borrowing amounts 
interest income insured mortgage securities interest income from insured mortgage securities decreased by approximately million or to million for from million for this decrease was principally due to the prepayment of mortgage securities held by criimi mae and its wholly owned subsidiaries for net proceeds aggregating approximately million and the sale of four mortgage securities and a portion of a fifth mortgage security for net proceeds aggregating approximately million during interest income originated loans interest income from originated loans of approximately million for was derived from originated loans included in the cmo iv securitization 
the cmo iv securitization totaled million face value of conduit loans  a majority of which were no lock 
interest expense interest expense increased by approximately million or to approximately million for from approximately million for this increase was principally a result of increased borrowings in connection with the acquisition of subordinated cmbs during additionally  criimi mae incurred interest expense in connection with million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes issued during the fourth quarter of and the issuance of collateralized mortgage obligations in connection with cmo iv 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of million face amount of debt de recognized from the financial statements in conjunction with cbo in may and the decrease in the company s weighted average cost of borrowing to in from in  primarily due to a decrease in one month libor  based on the average  for the year as compared to the year due to the chapter filing  certain lenders declared defaults or otherwise taken action against the company with respect to a number of criimi mae s financing facilities 
see legal proceedings for a discussion of material litigation between the company and various creditors and agreements the company has reached with certain of these creditors 
net interest margin net interest margin increased by approximately million or for to approximately million from approximately million for the net interest margin increase was due primarily to the increase in subordinated cmbs and  to a lesser extent  income from originated loans  as previously discussed 
gain on sale of cmbs in may  criimi mae completed cbo pursuant to which it sold million of investment grade securities created through the resecuritization of approximately billion of its subordinated cmbs 
criimi mae recognized a gain of approximately million on the sale of million face amount investment grade securities sold without call provisions  recognizing criimi mae s transfer of control on those securities 
the sale of million face amount investment grade securities with significant call provisions was treated as a financing and resulted in an unrealized gain of approximately million 
certain of these securities included call provisions to enable criimi mae to repurchase bonds if market conditions warrant  and call bonds when it is no longer cost effective to service them 
the sold investment grade securities treated as a financing  as well as approximately billion face amount of investment grade and non investment grade securities retained by criimi mae  are now required to be reflected on criimi mae s balance sheet at their fair market value 
additionally  due to the sale treatment under fas  all remaining subordinated cmbs and insured mortgage securities are required to be carried at fair market value 
this reclassification currently results in a cumulative net decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million a million decrease from september  
additionally  as part of cbo  cmslp sold trustee servicing rights for million  resulting in a gain of million for tax purposes  and approximately  for financial reporting purposes 
equity in earnings from investments equity in earnings from investments decreased by approximately million or to million during as compared to million during this decrease included impairment losses on purchased mortgage servicing rights recorded by cmslp since their fair value was less than their amortized cost at december  the general market turmoil commencing in late summer of resulted in the use of higher yields in determining the servicing rights fair value which caused the fair value to be less than the amortized cost 
at september   cmslp was responsible for certain servicing functions on a mortgage loan portfolio of approximately billion 
however  due to criimi mae s chapter filing and its relationship with criimi mae  cmslp arranged for bomcm to succeed it as master servicer on two commercial mortgage pools during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a loss of approximately million for the recorded value of the rights  of which substantially all of the loss flowed through to criimi mae 
these decreases are partially offset by increases in servicing fee streams and float income earned on escrow balances derived from the remaining servicing portfolio  which has grown to approximately billion as of december  as compared to approximately billion as of december other income other income increased by approximately million or to million during as compared to million during this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in short term interest and other income earned during on the amounts deposited in the loan origination reserve account  which had an average balance of approximately million for the year ended december  approximately million of short term interest income and net carry income were earned on these deposits for the year ended december  amounts earned on the origination reserve account for the year ended december  were immaterial 
gains on mortgage dispositions during  net gains on mortgage dispositions were approximately million  of which approximately  was a result of prepayments of mortgage securities held by criimi mae s subsidiaries  or approximately of its portfolio 
in addition  criimi mae sold four unencumbered mortgage securities and a portion of a fifth mortgage security  which resulted in a financial statement gain of  during  cri liquidating s disposition of its remaining mortgage assets and its interest in three limited partnership participation agreements resulted in net gains of approximately million before minority interests for financial statement purposes 
these net gains were partially offset by nine prepayments of mortgage assets held by criimi mae s subsidiaries which resulted in financial statement losses of  for any year  gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgages disposed of during the period 
the proceeds realized from the disposition of mortgage assets are based on the net coupon rates of the specific mortgages disposed of in relation to prevailing long term interest rates at the date of disposition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million for as compared to million for the increase in general and administrative expenses during these periods was primarily the result of the significant growth of criimi mae s commercial mortgage operations during the first nine months of this increase was partially offset in the fourth quarter due to the closing of regional offices  the suspension of certain business activities and the dismissal of employees involved in suspended activities following the chapter filing 
realized loss on reverse repurchase obligation and unrealized losses on warehouse obligations during  the company recorded realized and unrealized losses aggregating million and million  respectively  primarily due to the impact of financial market volatility on losses on hedge positions and commitments related to commercial mortgage loans in the company s securitization pipeline 
as part of cmo iv  the company intended to sell certain of the security tranches that were not initially sold to the public the cmo iv bbb bonds 
in anticipation of this sale  the company entered into a transaction to hedge the value of those securities 
as a result  criimi mae borrowed and then sold a year treasury note in the amount of million 
the company was informed by citibank that the position was closed on october  this transaction did not qualify for hedge accounting purposes because it involved the purchase and sale of a cash instrument and therefore is required to be recorded at market marked to market 
because treasury rates declined from the date of the transaction to the liquidation of the position  the company recorded a realized loss of approximately million  of which approximately million was recognized as of september  with the remaining  loss recognized in the fourth quarter 
the parties who fund the company s loan originations are required under the relevant agreements to hedge the related loans and to provide timely written hedge position reporting 
as of december   the company s obligation under the citibank program was million based primarily on information provided by citibank in excess of the fair value of the loans and the company s loss exposure under the prudential program was million if the company does not exercise its option 
as a result  criimi mae recorded an aggregate million unrealized loss on its obligations as of december  the unrealized loss of million relating to the citibank program as of december   is based on the estimated fair value of the loans offset by the unpaid principal balance of the loans at december   hedge losses and certain estimated fees and other costs 
depending on market conditions  including interest rate movements  these losses could materially increase or decrease in subsequent reporting periods 
the company has calculated the prudential loss based upon the assumption that the company will not exercise its option with prudential 
write off of capitalized origination costs since the company no longer has the intention to securitize the remaining loans in warehouse that were originated through the citibank and prudential programs  the net deferred costs of million associated with the warehoused loans were written off in reorganization items during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded million in reorganization items due to the chapter filings of criimi mae  cm management and holdings ii 
reorganization item amount professional fees  write off of debt discounts and deferred costs  employee retention program accrued costs  lease cancellation fees  excise tax  other  total  financial statement net income as a result of the foregoing  net income available to common shareholders for financial statement purposes was approximately million for  a decrease from approximately million for on a per basic share basis  financial statement net income decreased to per basic share for from per basic share in tax basis income criimi mae earned approximately million in tax basis income available to common shareholders in or per share  compared to approximately million or per share in the primary factors resulting in the million increase in tax basis income from to was due to the growth of criimi mae s portfolio of subordinated cmbs and  to a lesser extent  earnings from cmo iv 
also contributing to the increase in tax basis income was a million gain on the sale of the trustee servicing rights associated with cbo see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting the increases in the foregoing were increases in interest expense  general and administrative expenses  reorganization items and the write off of certain net deferred costs related to the citibank and prudential programs 
although  in absolute dollars  tax basis income increased from to  tax basis income per share decreased due to the increase in the average number of shares outstanding from  in to  in total tax basis income per share for included of non recurring income from the mortgage dispositions of a subsidiary  cri liquidating  that completed its scheduled liquidation in late see also note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations versus interest income subordinated cmbs income from subordinated cmbs increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million during as compared to approximately million during this increase was a result of the acquisition of subordinated cmbs at purchase prices aggregating approximately million during as compared to approximately million during generally accepted accounting principles require that the income on subordinated cmbs be recorded based on the effective interest method using the anticipated yield over the expected life of these mortgage assets 
this currently results in income which is lower for financial statement purposes than for tax purposes 
based on the timing and amount of future credit losses and certain other assumptions estimated by management  as discussed below  the estimated weighted average anticipated unleveraged yield for criimi mae s subordinated cmbs for financial statement purposes as of december  and  was approximately and  respectively 
this return was determined based on the anticipated yield over the expected weighted average life of the subordinated cmbs  which considers  among other things  anticipated losses and interest expense attributable to the financing of the rated tranches at current interest rates and current borrowing amounts 
interest income insured mortgage securities mortgage income decreased by approximately million or to approximately million for from approximately million for this decrease was principally due to the scheduled disposition of the remaining mortgages of cri liquidating s mortgage assets in in accordance with its business plan 
also contributing to the decrease in mortgage income was the prepayment of nine mortgages held by criimi mae and its wholly owned subsidiaries for net proceeds aggregating approximately million of proceeds during interest expense interest expense increased by approximately million or to approximately million for from approximately million for this increase was principally a result of additional amounts borrowed in connection with the acquisition of subordinated cmbs during and to a lesser extent  the marginally higher cost of debt on cbo these increases were mitigated by temporary paydowns of short term secured financing facilities during  pending the purchase of additional cmbs 
net interest margin net interest margin increased by approximately million or for the twelve months ended december  to approximately million from approximately for the corresponding period in the net interest margin increase was due primarily to the increase in subordinated cmbs 
equity in earnings from investments equity in earnings from investments decreased by approximately  or to million during as compared to million during the decrease was primarily due to a one time receipt in the fourth quarter of of previously unpaid and unaccrued net servicing fees approximately million received by cmslp on a group of multi family loans 
this decrease was partially offset by higher income from cmslp  which resulted from additional servicing fee streams derived from an expanded servicing portfolio  which grew to approximately billion as of december  as compared to approximately billion as of december  the increased servicing fee revenue was partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses associated with the growth in the servicing portfolio  as well as amortization of certain purchased servicing rights 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million or to million for as compared to million for the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of the continued growth of criimi mae s commercial mortgage operations 
gains losses on mortgage dispositions during  cri liquidating disposed of its remaining mortgage assets and its interest in three limited partnership participation agreements resulting in net gains of approximately million for financial statement purposes 
these net gains were partially offset by nine prepayments of mortgage assets held by criimi mae and its subsidiaries which resulted in financial statement net losses of  this compares to the disposition of cri liquidating mortgage assets which resulted in financial statement net gains of approximately million and criimi mae mortgage prepayments which resulted in net losses of  during gains or losses on mortgage dispositions are based on the number  carrying amounts and proceeds of mortgages disposed of during the period 
the proceeds realized from the disposition of mortgage assets were based on the net coupon rates of the specific mortgages disposed of in relation to prevailing long term interest rates at the date of disposition 
financial statement net income as a result of the foregoing  net income available to common shareholders for financial statement purposes was approximately million for  a increase from approximately million for on a per basic share basis  financial statement net income increased to per basic share for from for tax basis income criimi mae earned approximately million in tax basis income available to common shareholders during  a increase from approximately million earned in tax basis income per share increased to in from in ordinary income increased to in from in the primary factor for the increase in tax basis income for as compared to was continued growth in criimi mae s portfolio of subordinated cmbs 
partially offsetting these increases in income was a decrease in mortgage interest income due to the mortgage security dispositions described above  an increase in interest expense as a result of additional amounts borrowed to acquire subordinated cmbs and an increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of criimi mae s continued growth 
net capital gains resulting from the disposition of cri liquidating s mortgage assets  on a per share basis  decreased from 
per weighted average share in to 
per weighted average share in see also note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities increased for as compared to primarily due to the increase in the net interest margin resulting from the company s acquisitions of subordinated cmbs and  to a lesser extent  cmo iv as previously discussed in results of operations 
this increase in net interest margin was partially offset primarily by an increase in net receivables associated with the chapter filing 
net cash used in investing activities increased for as compared to the increase was primarily a result of increased purchases of subordinated cmbs 
also contributing to the increase in cash used in investing activities was the purchase of million of commercial loans in connection with cmo iv 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of proceeds received from the sale of collateral bond obligations in connection with cbo and from mortgage securities disposition proceeds 
net cash provided by financing activities increased for as compared to primarily due to proceeds from debt issuances related to the sale of the collateralized mortgage obligations in connection with cmo iv  collateralized bond obligations in connection with cbo  and variable rate secured borrowings  net of principal payments  and increased proceeds from equity offerings 
these increases were partially offset by payments made in connection with collateral calls made by lenders primarily in the latter part of the third quarter 
versus net cash provided by operating activities increased for as compared to primarily due to an increase in net income 
partially offsetting this increase is an increase in gains on mortgage dispositions and an increase in interest receivable on subordinated cmbs as a result of subordinated cmbs acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities increased for as compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in purchases of subordinated cmbs  decreased proceeds from mortgage dispositions  increased purchases of servicing rights and the funding of the loan origination reserve 
net cash provided by financing activities increased from as compared to primarily due to increased proceeds from debt issuances  net of principal payments 
additionally  proceeds from equity offerings increased primarily as a result of various stock offerings in the net proceeds from debt issuances and equity offerings were used primarily to fund additional subordinated cmbs purchases  and  to a lesser extent  fund the estimated subordinate class of loans originated through criimi mae s mortgage loan conduit program 
partially offsetting the increase was an increase in dividends paid resulting from increased net income 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the petition date  criimi mae used proceeds from long term  fixed rate match funded debt refinancings  short term  variable rate  secured borrowings  securitizations  other borrowings  issuances of common and preferred shares and unsecured borrowings to meet the capital requirements of its business plan 
since the chapter filing  the company has suspended its subordinated cmbs acquisition  origination and securitization operations  but continues to service mortgage loans through cmslp 
prior to the petition date  criimi mae financed a substantial portion of its subordinated cmbs acquisitions with short term  variable rate borrowings secured by the company s subordinated cmbs 
the agreements governing these financing arrangements typically required the company to maintain loan to value ratios 
the agreements further provided that the lenders could require the company to post cash or additional collateral if the value of the existing collateral fell below this minimum amount 
in order to refinance a portion of its short term  variable rate secured borrowings with long term  fixed rate debt  the company entered into resecuritization transactions 
in may  criimi mae completed cbo  its second resecuritization of its subordinated cmbs portfolio  which under fas  qualified for both sale and financing accounting 
through cbo  criimi mae refinanced million of its variable rate debt with fixed rate  match funded debt 
the debt is considered match funded because the maturities and principal requirements of the debt match those of the related collateral 
the transaction also generated additional borrowing capacity of approximately million  which was used primarily to fund additional subordinated cmbs purchases 
in june  criimi mae securitized million of originated or acquired commercial mortgage loans by selling million face amount of fixed rate investment grade securities 
the tranches not sold to the public were partially financed with variable rate  secured financing agreements 
after the above structured finance transactions  the company continued to have a substantial amount of short term  variable rate  secured financing facilities which were subject to the previously discussed collateral requirements based on cmbs security prices 
as a result of the turmoil in the capital markets commencing in late summer of  the spreads between cmbs yields and the yields on treasury securities with comparable maturities began to increase substantially and rapidly 
criimi mae s short term secured creditors perceived that the value of the subordinated cmbs securing their facilities with the company had fallen below the minimum loan to value ratio and  consequently  made demand upon the company to provide cash or additional collateral with sufficient value to cure the perceived value deficiency 
in august and september of  the company received and met collateral calls from its secured creditors 
at the same time  criimi mae was in negotiations with various third parties in an effort to obtain additional debt and equity financing that would provide the company with additional liquidity 
on friday afternoon  october   the company was in the closing negotiations of a refinancing with one of its unsecured creditors that would have provided the company with additional borrowings  when it received a significant collateral call from merrill lynch 
the basis for this collateral call  in the company s view  was unreasonable 
after giving consideration to  among other things  this collateral call and the company s concern that its failure to satisfy this collateral call would cause the company to be in default under a substantial portion of its financing arrangements  the company reluctantly concluded on sunday  october  that it was in the best interests of creditors  equity holders and other parties in interest to seek chapter protection 
accordingly  the company filed for relief under chapter on monday  october  at december   criimi mae had secured financing agreements with gacc  lehman ali  inc  first union  morgan stanley  merrill lynch  and citicorp 
certain of these lenders have registered the pledged securities in their own names 
as a result  the trustee makes payments on such securities to the registered holder 
during the fourth quarter  certain registered holders withheld payments related to securities not registered to criimi mae 
the company has negotiated and finalized agreements with four of its lenders 
criimi mae s cash position has increased from approximately million on october  to approximately million as of march  based on present information  the company believes that it will have sufficient cash flow to fund its current operations while in bankruptcy during however  due to the uncertainty of the effects of the chapter filing on the business of the company  pending litigation  material reorganization items to be incurred during the pendency of the bankruptcy and numerous other factors beyond the company s control  no assurance can be given that the company s cash flow will be sufficient to fund operations while the company is in bankruptcy during the company s ability to resume the acquisition of subordinated cmbs  as well as its loan origination and securitization programs  depends on its ability to obtain additional capital and emerge from bankruptcy as a successfully reorganized company 
factors which could affect the company s access to the capital markets  or the costs of such capital  include changes in interest rates  general economic conditions and perception in the capital markets of the company s business  covenants under the company s current and future debt securities and credit facilities  results of operations  leverage  financial conditions and business prospects 
the company can give no assurances as to whether it will obtain capital or the terms upon which capital can be obtained 
dividends during the pendency of the chapter proceedings  the company is prohibited from paying dividends without first obtaining bankruptcy court approval 
among the other factors which impact criimi mae s dividends are i the level of income earned on uninsured mortgage assets  such as subordinated cmbs including  but not limited to  the amount of oid income and losses  if any  on subordinated cmbs  and  to the extent applicable  originated loans  which varies depending on prepayments  defaults  etc  ii the level of income earned on criimi mae s or its subsidiaries insured mortgage security collateral depending on prepayments  defaults  etc  iii the fluctuating yields on short term  variable rate  debt and the rate at which criimi mae s libor based debt is priced  as well as the rate criimi mae pays on its other borrowings  iv the rate at which cash flows from mortgage assets  mortgage dispositions  and  to the extent applicable  loan origination reserves  escrow deposits and distributions from its subsidiaries can be reinvested  v changes in operating expenses including those related to the chapter filing  vi to the extent applicable  dividends paid on preferred shares  vii to the extent applicable  whether the company s taxable mortgage pools continue to be exempt from corporate level taxes  viii the timing and amounts of cash flows attributable to its other lines of business mortgage servicing  advisory  to the extent applicable  origination services and  ix to the extent applicable  realized losses on certain transactions 
dividends paid or accrued per share are summarized below for the three months ended for the twelve months ended december  december  common shares series b preferred shares in addition to the per share amounts described above  amounts paid or payable to series c cumulative preferred shares for the three and twelve months ended december  were  and  respectively  and amounts paid or payable to series d cumulative preferred shares for the three and twelve months ended december  were  and  respectively 
in addition to the per share amounts described above  series a preferred shares were paid  for the twelve months ended december  and series c cumulative preferred shares were paid  for the twelve months ended december  due to the chapter filing on october   dividends were not paid in the fourth quarter on common or preferred shares 
however  since dividends on the company s preferred shares are cumulative  the dividends payable at december  were accrued in the financial statements 
reit status criimi mae has elected to qualify as a reit for tax purposes under sections of the internal revenue code for the tax year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s principal market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates related to the us treasury market as well as the libor market 
the company will have an increase in the amount of interest expense paid on its variable rate obligations primarily due to increases in one month libor 
the company will also experience fluctuations in the market value of its assets related to changes in the interest rates of us treasury bonds as well as increases in the spread between us treasury bonds and cmbs 
criimi mae has entered into interest rate protection agreements to mitigate the adverse effects of rising interest rates on its variable rate borrowings 
the caps provide protection to criimi mae to the extent interest rates  based on a readily determinable interest rate index typically one month libor  increase above the stated interest rate cap  in which case  criimi mae will receive payments based on the difference between the index and the cap 
the term of the cap as well as the stated interest rate of the cap  which in most cases is currently above the current rate of the index  will limit to some degree the amount of protection that the caps offer 
prior to the petition date  criimi mae financed a substantial portion of its subordinated cmbs acquisitions with short term  variable rate borrowings secured by the company s cmbs 
the agreements governing these financing arrangements typically required the company to maintain collateral at all times with a market value not less than a specified percentage of the outstanding indebtedness 
the agreements further provided that the lenders could require the company to post cash or additional collateral if the value of the existing collateral fell below this threshold amount 
these financing arrangements were used by criimi mae to provide financing during the period of time from the acquisition or creation of the subordinated cmbs to the date when criimi mae would resecuritize the portfolio in order to match fund a significant portion of the portfolio with fixed rate debt  thereby eliminating interest rate risk on this portion of the cmbs 
criimi mae  in limited cases  entered into transactions to hedge the value of securities it intended to sell by selling short treasury or government insured securities the company did not own 
these transactions are marked to market with unrealized gains or losses reflected in the company s income statement
