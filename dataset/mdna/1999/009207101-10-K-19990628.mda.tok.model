under the terms of the dry lease service agreements  which currently cover approximately of the revenue aircraft operated  the company passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
agreements are renewable annually and may be terminated by the customer at any time upon to days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with the customer are standard within the air freight contract delivery service industry 
the company is not contractually precluded from providing such services to other firms  and has done so in the past 
loss of its contracts with the customer would have a material adverse effect on the company

in general  the bulk of global s revenues and earnings have typically occurred during the second and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the winter season  and comparatively little has occurred during the first and fourth fiscal quarters due to the nature of its product line 
the company is currently attempting to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company expended exceptional effort in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal to design and produce prototype equipment to expand its current product line to include three basic models of scissor lift equipment for catering  cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft 
in addition  in june  the company was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force for a total amount of approximately million

results of operations fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue primarily resulted from increases in revenue from mas and the impact of a full year of revenue from global in fiscal however  global s revenue for the full fiscal year ended march  was only approximately greater than revenue for the seven months of operations of global included in the prior fiscal year

in the fiscal year ended march   global had an operating loss of  compared to operating income in the prior period of  several factors contributed to this change in global s operating results 
first  global s revenue for the full fiscal year ended march  was only greater than revenue for the seven months of operations included in the prior fiscal year 
the company believes that fiscal revenue reflects both the effect of significantly reduced demand for aircraft deicer equipment due to above normal winter temperatures and significant price competition that resulted in above normal sales discounts 
the company anticipates that the four year contract recently awarded to global to supply the united states air force with deicing equipment for a total of million will reduce the sensitivity of global s operating results to seasonal weather conditions 
because management expects shipments under that contract will not commence until the quarter ending december   the full impact of the contract will not occur until the year ending march  second  during fiscal  global incurred significant expense developing new products to diversify its product line

year issue the company has initiated a comprehensive review of its operations and computer systems to identify the extent to which it could be affected by the year issue  which is the result of computer programs written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
the company has broken down its review to assess its information technology systems it systems  the aspects of its operations that rely on devices that may contain embedded microchips non it systems and its relationships and reliance on vendors  suppliers  customers and others with whom the company deals whose operations may be affected by the year issue 
this review was conducted by the company s year committee  authorized to assess the company s risks and develop a comprehensive plan to address the year issue 
state of readiness it systems 
as a result of such review  as of the date of this annual report on form k  the company believes it has catalogued all it systems utilized directly by the company 
the company has revised  and is testing  certain customized it systems to enable such systems to work properly following the year and has verified that recently acquired it systems from third party vendors are year compliant 
management utilized external resources to upgrade internal software systems to become year compliant 
management believes that such systems will be completely tested by june  non it systems 
the company utilizes a number of devices that include embedded microchips that may be affected by the year issue  including aircraft operated under lease agreements with its major customer 
the company anticipates completing the testing and replacing of any noncompliant devices by june  under its agreements with its major customer the cost of replacing such components in aircraft leased by the company from its customer would be passed on to the customer 
material third parties 
the company is making concerted efforts to understand the year compliance readiness of third parties including  among others  domestic and international government agencies and air traffic control systems material to the company s operations  vendors  suppliers and major customers whose year non compliance could either have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations or involve a safety risk to employees or customers 
the company has actively encouraged year compliance on the part of third parties and has developed contingency plans in the event of their year non compliance by june  the company has contacted  in writing and by telephone  each mission critical vendor and supplier  requesting completion of a questionnaire to assess such third party s year compliance 
the company s vendors and suppliers are under no contractual obligation to provide such information to the company 
although the company has received written or verbal assurances of compliance by june   year issue disruptions experienced by mission critical vendors could adversely affect the company s operations 
the company has met with its major air cargo customer on numerous occasions to discuss year readiness 
in addition  the company has reviewed public filings of its major customer to assess the customer s state of year compliance 
such discussions and filings indicate plans by such customer to be internal systems year compliant  including operating subsidiaries  by november  however  such customer s operations rely on many third parties  including governmental agencies  airports and air traffic control systems described below 
in conjunction with the company s major air cargo customer and industry trade associations  the company is involved in an industry wide effort to understand the year compliance status of airports  air traffic systems  and other us and international government agencies that may affect the company s air cargo operations 
the company s air cargo routes are selected and scheduled by its major customer 
in addition to general risks raised by the year issue  the company s primary business segment  providing air cargo services to the overnight express delivery industry  is subject to significant additional risks 
first  the company s relationship with its major air cargo customer is based  in significant part  on the company s operating reliability 
a failure to timely confirm its year compliance to the customer could result in a loss of such relationship 
the company has provided this customer with an anticipated time schedule for completion of its year compliance program  which the company has verified fits within the customer s planned schedule 
in addition  the bulk of the company s aircraft fleet is leased from such customer and is dedicated for use in flying routes designated by the customer 
costs the company estimates the cost incurred to date for year compliance is approximately  no future cost are expected to be incurred 
the foregoing costs do not include the allocation of internal employee time since the company does not track such internal costs 
contingency plans the company has developed contingency plans for year non compliance  some of which are discussed above 
due to the company s dependence upon  and its current uncertainty with  the year compliance of certain government agencies  third party suppliers  vendors and customers with whom the company deals  the company is unable to determine at this time its most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
while costs related to the lack of year compliance by third parties  business interruptions  litigation and other liabilities related to year issues could materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  the company expects its internal year compliance efforts to reduce significantly the company s level of uncertainty about the impact of year issues affecting both its it systems and non it systems
