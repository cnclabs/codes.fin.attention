item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results  performance or achievements or the machine tool industry to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  i changes in general economic and business conditions that affect demand for computer numeric control cnc systems  machine tools and software products  ii changes in manufacturing markets  iii innovations by competitors  iv quality and delivery performance by our contract manufacturers and v governmental actions and initiatives including import and export restrictions and tariffs 
results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal years indicated  selected items from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of worldwide sales and service fees and the year to year percentage changes in the dollar amounts of those items 
percentage of revenues year to year change increase decrease vs 
vs 
sales and service fees gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring charge operating income interest expense net income fiscal compared with fiscal net income for the fiscal year ending october  was million  or per share  on a diluted basis  compared to million  or per share  for the preceding year 
included in results was a million restructuring charge which is more fully discussed below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income in fiscal and also included million and million  respectively  of license fees and litigation settlements net of expenses and foreign withholding taxes 
excluding the restructuring charge and net license fee and litigation settlements  net income in fiscal would have been million  or 
per share  on a diluted basis  compared to million  or 
per share  in fiscal in addition  the provision for income taxes in fiscal increased by  or  primarily the result of the earnings of a foreign subsidiary which no longer has the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
sales and service fees were million for fiscal  a decrease of from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in sales for the fiscal year was due in part to the negative impact of a stronger us dollar during the first three fiscal quarters  when converting foreign sales to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
at constant exchange rates  net sales and service fees for the fiscal year would have been million 
sales of computerized machine systems  before foreign currency translation effects  increased million  or  for the fiscal year and accounted for of our annual sales and service fees 
domestic sales of computerized machine systems in fiscal approximated the fiscal level while sales in the united kingdom  which experienced unfavorable economic conditions  declined million  or 
sales of computerized machine systems in continental europe  primarily germany and france  increased million  or  in fiscal also contributing to the increase in computerized machine systems was our offering of a new milling machine featuring a fully integrated delta tm cnc system sold under the dynapath tm name and our press brake system sold with a fully integrated autobend cnc system 
both computerized machine systems were released for sale in the second half of fiscal the increase in sales of computerized machine systems was offset by a million  or  decline in sales of stand alone cnc systems 
the decline in stand alone cnc systems was the result of reduced shipments to original equipment manufacturers oem s and retrofit dealers of stand alone cnc systems  primarily related to our delta series cnc systems  as we reposition these products for marketing as components of integrated machine systems 
service income declined by approximately  or  as a result of our on going transfer of customer servicing responsibility to certain of our distributors as well as improved quality of the computerized machine systems 
international sales  including export sales from the united states  increased to approximately of consolidated sales and service fees for fiscal compared to for fiscal orders for the year were million compared to million in the prior year  a million  or  decrease 
computerized machine system orders increased million  or  while stand alone cnc system orders decreased million  or 
computerized machine system unit orders in continental europe principally germany france increased while orders in the united states and england declined reflecting weaker demand in those markets 
offsetting the increase in computerized machine system orders was a decline in stand alone cnc system orders units of 
the decline in orders for stand alone cnc systems is the result of our repositioning these products for marketing as components of integrated computerized machine systems 
backlog was million at october  and million at october  gross profit margin as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the increase was primarily the result of reduced costs of computerized machine systems produced by our contract manufacturers in taiwan due to the weakening of the new taiwan dollar in fiscal also contributing to the improved margin was an increased mix of higher margin european sales 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal totaling million related to our subsidiary autocon technologies  inc ati 
ati historically marketed its delta series of cnc systems to oem s and through retro fit dealers 
throughout fiscal  we have been repositioning ati to market its cnc products as components of fully integrated computerized machine systems under the dynapath tm brand name 
the first of several planned models of the dynapath tm machine systems product line was successfully launched in fiscal resulting in sales of  the decline in oem controls sales  concurrent with a decline in demand for retro fit cnc systems and inventory write downs  resulted in operating losses related to ati  before restructuring charges  of million for the fiscal year ended october  in october  we initiated a more comprehensive restructuring of ati s business to include consolidation of operations  contract manufacturing of cnc systems in taiwan  simplification of the cnc product offering and cancellation of certain product development projects  as well as rationalizing the sales and customer service activities 
this restructuring program  which is expected to be completed during the first half of fiscal  resulted in a million restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge was comprised of approximately  of reserves for the write down of fixed assets and  of accrued liabilities for employee severance costs and obligations under lease of manufacturing and office space that will no longer be used 
interest expense for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  from the amount reported for the corresponding period in fiscal  primarily due to debt reduction in fiscal combined with the full year effect of the million debt reduction that occurred in fiscal license fee income and litigation settlement fees for fiscal  represented of income before taxes compared to in fiscal and was attributable almost entirely to licenses entered into during the year by ims 
as of october   license fees of approximately  net of legal fees and expenses  have been deferred and are expected to be recognized through fiscal there are a limited number of remaining cnc users that ims has identified as potential licensees 
accordingly  we believe that it is unlikely that future license fee income and litigation settlement fees will equal that recorded in fiscal for further information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal  consisted of approximately  of foreign withholding taxes resulting from license fee income and litigation settlement fees and approximately million related to the earnings of a foreign subsidiary which no longer has the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
the provision for foreign income taxes in fiscal consisted almost entirely of foreign withholding taxes resulting from license fee income and litigation settlement fees 
net operating loss carryforwards available to offset pre tax income in future periods are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a german tax examiner has contested our transfer of net operating losses between two of our german subsidiaries that merged in fiscal the contingent tax liability resulting from this issue is approximately million 
we have protested this matter and the german tax authorities are expected to rule on the tax examiner s finding in the first half of fiscal in the event an unfavorable ruling is received from the german tax authorities  we will appeal to the german federal tax court 
no provision for the contingency has been recorded 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales and service fees in fiscal decreased million  or  compared with fiscal of the total decrease  million reflected the net effects of translating foreign currency revenues into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
sales of computerized machine systems  which totaled million in fiscal  were below the million recorded during fiscal the decrease occurred in the us market  with a decline of million  or  as well as in s 
e 
asia  where the decline of million  or  was most pronounced and reflected the economic turmoil in that region 
sales of computerized machine systems in europe increased  or  in spite of the adverse impact of foreign currency translation 
the first half of fiscal was marked by an unusually high level of shipments  as the increasing availability of products from our contract manufacturers permitted an accelerated reduction of the higher than normal backlog that existed at the end of fiscal sales of cnc systems and software which do not include systems that are sold as an integral part of a machine tool increased during fiscal by  or  primarily due to increased shipments of autobend r control products in response to improved worldwide market demand 
sales of service parts and service fees decreased by  or  compared to fiscal  which is attributable to improvements in recent years in the quality of our products along with a transfer of responsibility to our distributors in the united states for certain servicing activities 
international sales  including exports from the united states  increased to approximately of consolidated sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal worldwide new order bookings during fiscal were million  an increase of from the million reported for fiscal  in spite of the unfavorable effect of weaker foreign currencies 
new order bookings would have been million  an increase of measured at average fiscal exchange rates constant us dollars 
new orders for computerized machine systems increased in units and in constant us dollars 
domestic us computerized machine systems orders increased in units and in dollars which was attributable primarily to demand for our proprietary designed inch axis machining center models introduced in late fiscal computerized machine system orders in europe increased in units and in constant us dollars  due in large part to demand for the new inch axis models 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in computerized machine systems orders in south east asia of million  or  to less than million in fiscal new orders for cnc systems and software  exclusive of cnc systems and software sold as an integrated component of machine tools  declined million  or  due primarily to reduced orders for the delta series controls from oem customers 
backlog at october  was million compared to million at october gross profit percentage  as a percentage of sales  increased to in fiscal  compared to for fiscal net of currency translation effects 
the improvement in margin is attributable to the combined effects of an increased percentage of higher margin european shipments in the total sales mix and increased domestic and european shipments of higher margin products introduced in the latter part of fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expense in fiscal decreased by approximately  or  from fiscal and is primarily the result of translating operating expenses of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
interest expense for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  from the amount reported for the corresponding period in fiscal  primarily due to a million reduction in outstanding borrowings and the payment during fiscal of  of nonrecurring fees to our lenders 
license fee income  net for fiscal  represented approximately of income before taxes compared to in fiscal and was attributable almost entirely to licenses entered into during the year by ims 
the provision for income taxes is almost entirely the result of foreign withholding taxes related to license payments received during the fiscal year 
the income tax liability incurred in the united states and certain other jurisdictions was offset by the reversal of valuation allowance reserves against our net operating loss carryforwards 
primarily as a result of the substantial licensing fee income received during the period  net income for fiscal increased by approximately million compared to fiscal the increase also reflected the benefits of improved margins and the substantial reduction in interest expense 
year compliance the year problem 
many information technology it hardware and software systems it systems and non it systems containing embedded technology  such as microcontrollers and micro processors non it systems  can only process dates with six digits eg   instead of eight digits eg  
this limitation may cause it systems and non it systems to experience problems processing information with dates after december  eg  could be processed as or or with other dates  such as september   which was a date traditionally used as a default date by computer programmers 
these problems may cause it systems and non it systems to suffer miscalculations  malfunctions or disruptions 
these problems are commonly referred to as year or yk problems 
our state of readiness 
we have begun to implement a plan to ensure that the it systems and material non it systems that we control are yk compliant before january  in the first phase of the plan  which has been completed  we assessed the potential exposure of our it systems and material non it systems to yk problems 
in the second phase  which we have also completed  we designed a procedure to remediate our exposure to yk problems in the it systems and material non it systems that we control 
we are currently in the third phase  which involves the actual remediation and enhancements of the it systems and material non it systems that we control 
after we complete the third phase  we will begin the fourth and final phase of testing the remediation and enhancements to the it systems and material non it systems that we control to ensure yk compliance 
we believe that we have identified all it systems and material non it systems that we control that may require yk remediation 
we have assigned nine people both employees and outside consultants to complete the remediation and enhancements to our it systems that we control 
we plan to complete the remediation  enhancements and testing by june  we have assigned three employees to either remediate or cause the remediation of material non it systems that we control and that we have identified as possessing a yk problem 
we plan to complete the remediation of these non it systems by june  we have acquired some of these non it systems during the past few years and we believe that a substantial number of these newer systems do not possess a yk problem 
in addition  the vendors of some of these newer non it systems have warranted them to be yk compliant 
we have contacted the third parties who control our other material non it systems including  without limitation  communication systems  security systems  electrical systems and hvac systems to assess whether any of these systems possess a yk problem that could adversely affect our operations if a malfunction occurred 
we have also implemented procedures to help ensure that any new non it systems that we acquire or utilize are yk compliant 
we have completed year testing on our cnc products and have prepared technical bulletins that describe the products tested and the impact year will have on those products 
these technical bulletins are available upon request or can be obtained from our web site hurco 
com 
we believe that our cnc products will continue to function in year with only some models experiencing a minor file dating issue 
we are developing a policy for providing software updates to those products that will have the dating issue 
the costs to address the company s year issues 
our costs through october  to identify and remediate our year problems have not been material 
our costs to complete the year project are not expected to be material either 
the risks associated with our year issues 
our year compliance effort has not identified any worst case scenarios that we believe are reasonably likely to occur 
we do not expect year issues to interrupt our business unless disruption occurs as a result of year problems involving basic infrastructure outside of our control 
our computerized machine systems are manufactured primarily by three contract manufacturers in taiwan 
an interruption in supply from the contract manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have received assurances from all contract manufacturers that year will not cause delays in production 
although we have not identified any specific year issues that are reasonably likely to impact the production of the contract manufacturers  because of the uncertainty of the year issue  some risk of disruption in production does exist 
contingency plan 
we will continue to evaluate the impact year will have on our contract manufacturers 
if year issues are identified that we believe could reasonably disrupt production of the contract manufacturers  we will delay our fiscal finished goods inventory reduction program and maintain finished goods inventory at a level to protect against anticipated production delays 
we will continue monitoring the year issue and will develop a contingency plan if a reasonably likely risk is identified 
euro currency many of the countries in which we sell our products and services are member states of the economic and monetary union emu 
beginning january   member states of the emu may begin trading in either their local currencies or the euro  the official currency of emu participating member states 
parties are free to choose the unit they prefer in contractual relationships during the transitional period  beginning january and ending june our computer system contains the functionality to process transactions in either a country s local currency or the euro 
we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effects on our operations related to the emu s conversion to the euro 
however  there can be no assurance that the conversion of emu member states to the euro will not have a material adverse effect on our operations 
foreign currency risk management we manage our foreign currency exposure through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
we also moderate our currency risk related to significant purchase commitments with certain foreign vendors through price adjustment agreements that provide for a sharing of  or otherwise limit  the risk of currency fluctuations on the costs of purchased products 
the results of these programs achieved our objectives in fiscal and fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at october  cash provided by operations totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal cash flow from operations in fiscal was enhanced by receipts of approximately million of license fees  net of legal fees and taxes  received during fiscal  compared to million in fiscal working capital was million at october   compared to million at october  the working capital increase is attributable to an increase in inventory of million and accounts receivable of million offset by a increase in accounts payable 
the increase in inventories relates primarily to finished product available for shipment along with components to support current production schedules 
the increase is attributable to planned increases in production by our contract manufacturers for the latter half of fiscal  combined with lower than expected demand 
we anticipate an additional increase in finished product inventory during the first half of fiscal  which is expected to be absorbed during the second half of the fiscal year as reduced supplier delivery schedules take effect 
the increase in accounts receivable is entirely attributable to the timing of shipments in the fourth fiscal quarter 
days sales outstanding were days at october  and the increase in accounts payable relates to the increased shipments from contract manufacturers late in the fiscal year under terms which generally range from to days 
accounts payable are expected to decrease during the second half of fiscal commensurate with reduced inventory purchases 
capital investments for the fiscal year ended october  consisted principally of expenditures for software development projects and purchases of equipment 
cash used for investing activities during the year were funded by cash flow from operations 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock through october   under our previously announced stock repurchase program 
these shares are reflected as a reduction of common stock outstanding in calculating basic and diluted earnings per common share 
total debt at october  was million  representing of total capitalization  compared to million  or  of total capitalization at october  our bank credit agreement was amended on december  to permit borrowings  at any one time outstanding  of up to million inclusive of letter of credits of million 
all other terms under the agreement remained unchanged 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants at october  we believe that anticipated cash flow from operations and available borrowings under credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our bank line of credit is affected by the general level of us and european interest rates and or libor 
however  we only had million outstanding under our bank line of credit at october  and the effect of interest rate changes would not be significant 
foreign currency exchange risk a significant portion of our product content is sourced from foreign suppliers or built to our specifications by contract manufacturers overseas 
our contractual arrangements with those suppliers typically include foreign currency risk sharing agreements which reduce the effects of currency fluctuations on product cost 
the predominant portion of foreign currency exchange rate risk regarding product cost relates to the new taiwan dollar 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales and service fees  including export sales  were derived from overseas markets 
all computerized machine systems  cnc systems and certain proprietary service parts are sourced by a central engineering and manufacturing division of the us parent company and re invoiced to our foreign sales and service subsidiaries  primarily in their functional currencies 
the parent company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to inter company sales and inter company accounts receivable in foreign currencies 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes
