item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this report contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to certain factors which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in important factors regarding forward looking statements attached hereto as exhibit overview on february   we entered into an agreement with ascend which at the time was publicly owned but since then was acquired by lucent technologies  inc and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of lucent to sell to ascend substantially all of our assets relating to what had historically been our primary business of developing and selling speech coding technologies and products 
the sale to ascend was consummated on september  also on february   we entered into a definitive agreement with verbex to acquire substantially all of the assets of verbex 
the verbex transaction was consummated on february  since that time  voxware has been focusing its efforts on verbex s business of developing and selling speech recognition products for the warehousing and manufacturing markets as well as other industrial markets 
verbex historically generated revenues primarily from product sales  licenses and development services 
verbex product sales consist of portable devices used for mobile industrial speech recognition applications verbex s mvp product line  stationary speech recognition devices  primarily used for warehouse receiving and package sorting applications  and accessories that complemented its product offerings  including microphones  headsets and computer hardware 
verbex also licensed its vcore speech recognition software application for use in embedded applications  and provided maintenance services to customers  generally under one to three year agreements 
development services consist of providing technical resources and assistance to customer specific development efforts  which include porting verbex s technology to specific customer platforms 
revenues from product sales are generally recognized when products are shipped 
prior to its acquisition of verbex  voxware generated revenues relating to its speech and audio coding business from two sources fees from software product licenses and fees for services provided 
voxware s speech and audio coding product revenues consist of two components software license fees  and royalties and recurring revenues 
voxware licensed its products primarily to software and hardware companies which incorporated voxware s products and technologies into their products 
arrangements with customers  which were negotiated on a case by case basis  included one or more of the following initial license fees  quarterly license fees  annual license fees or royalties based on the licensee s revenue generated or units shipped of products incorporating voxware s technologies 
as a result  the timing and amount of our revenues were substantially dependent on the timing and efforts of our licensees in developing and marketing products incorporating our products and technologies 
software product revenues are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  the payment is due within one year and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
royalty revenues are recognized in the period of customer shipment 
service revenues consist of customer maintenance support and engineering fees 
customer maintenance support revenues are recognized over the term of the support period  which typically lasts for one year 
engineering fees are generally recognized upon customer acceptance or upon delivery if customer acceptance is not required 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the sale to ascend did not include voxware s rights and obligations under its existing license agreements 
we will continue to have revenue from existing licensees of our speech coding technology in the multimedia and consumer devices markets after the sale to ascend  in the form of periodic license renewal fees  royalties and service fees 
with the consent of ascend  we may also license our speech coding technologies after the sale for uses that are not competitive with ascend 
although we do not have any agreements or arrangements with ascend relating to any general or specific guidelines for obtaining ascend s consent  we believe that ascend will consent to our licensing the speech coding technologies in the multimedia and consumer devices markets 
we do not believe that we will have any revenues from new licensees in the internet protocol ip telephony market 
our revenue from licensing speech coding technologies and audio compression technologies has been decreasing over the last two years 
therefore  we expect that  even if ascend is willing to give its consent  our new licensing activity relating to the speech coding technologies will decrease significantly after the sale to ascend 
further  over time  as we focus on the verbex business  we expect that revenues from licenses of speech coding technologies will become a less significant part of our revenues 
the majority of our existing licensees of our speech compression products compete in the multimedia internet software market  which is a relatively new market  and many of the companies compete against much more established companies and or have businesses that are relatively immature 
we believe that a significant number of our licensees which compete in this market have not incorporated  and may never incorporate  voxware s technologies into their products 
therefore  we may never derive royalties or other recurring revenues from many of our existing license agreements in the multimedia internet software market 
with respect to internet protocol ip telephony  deployments in that market have primarily utilized standardized codec technologies and not voxware s proprietary codec technologies 
in addition  deployments in ip telephony have been characterized by bandwidth rich managed networks intranets  which networks generally do not benefit significantly from low bandwidth solutions such as voxware s technologies 
as a result of these factors  demand for voxware s technologies in the ip telephony market has not been significant 
in connection with the sale to ascend  have discontinued our activities in the ip telephony market 
based on our assessment regarding the multimedia internet software and ip telephony markets  in fiscal we shifted our business and marketing emphasis to oem customers in the electronic devices market 
voxware has only a limited operating history upon which an evaluation of voxware and its prospects can be based 
since its inception  voxware has incurred significant losses and  as of june   voxware had an accumulated deficit of  in at least the near term quarters  we expect to incur net losses as we pursue a new line of business 
the recent sale of our existing business to ascend and recent acquisition of the speech recognition systems business of verbex makes the prediction of future results of operations impossible 
therefore  voxware s historical revenues should not be taken as indicative of future revenues 
in addition  voxware s operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the entrance into a new line of business  the budgeting cycles of potential customers  the volume of  and revenues derived from sales of products by our licensees that incorporate our products  the rate of new licensing activity  as well as the termination of existing license agreements  the introduction of new products or services by the voxware or its competitors  pricing changes in the industry  the degree of success of voxware s efforts to penetrate its target markets  technical difficulties with respect to the use of products developed by voxware or its licensees  the level of usage of the internet  and general economic conditions 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal revenues voxware recorded revenues of  for the year ended june  compared to revenues of  for the year ended june  the  total decrease in revenues reflects decreases in the amounts of license fees  royalties and recurring revenues and service revenues from our speech compression technology products  partially offset by an increase in industrial speech recognition product sales 
during the year ended june   voxware derived approximately  of total revenues from multimedia customers versus approximately  of total revenues for the year ended june  the  decrease in multimedia revenues reflects the deterioration of the multimedia internet software market for voxware s speech compression products  a shift in voxware s focus away from the speech compression business and toward verbex s industrial speech recognition products business after voxware s acquisition of verbex in february  and also reflects that revenues earned from major customers during the fiscal year ended june  were not repeated or replaced during the year ended june  in particular  the amendment and termination of voxware s agreement with netscape  under which voxware derived  of total revenues in revenues during the fiscal year ended june  and none during the fiscal year ended june   accounts for a significant portion of the reduction in voxware s revenues 
we are not currently receiving any revenue from netscape and we do not anticipate receiving any revenues from netscape in the future 
during the fiscal year ended june   voxware recognized  of revenue from the sale of speech recognition products  all of which was recorded after our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of verbex in february these revenues represent voxware s first revenues recognized from the sale of verbex products 
we expect that over time  sales of speech recognition products will comprise the most significant portion of our revenue 
total product revenues decreased  from  in the fiscal year ended june  to  in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in product revenues reflects a decrease in the amount of license fees recognized during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the amount of license fees recognized during the fiscal year ended june   and a decrease in the amount of royalties and recurring revenues recognized during the period from customers who licensed the company s products in previous periods 
these decreases were partially offset by  in product sales attributable to speech recognition products 
we believe that the factors discussed in the overview above were primarily responsible for the overall decrease in product revenues 
for the fiscal years ended june  and  and none of the company s product revenues were attributable to product sales  respectively  and were attributable to license fees  respectively  and and were attributable to royalties and recurring revenues  respectively 
service revenues were primarily attributable to customer maintenance support and fees for engineering services 
for the fiscal year ended june   service revenues totaled  reflecting a decrease of  from service revenues of  for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in service revenues is primarily attributable to i a decline in customer maintenance support revenues because we had a much smaller portfolio of customers to which we provided maintenance support services during the fiscal year ended june  than we did for the fiscal year ended june   and ii a decline in development services revenues because of our shift in focus away from the custom development facet of the speech compression business to the operation of verbex s business 
service revenues for the fiscal year ended june  includes  earned pursuant to a services agreement between voxware and ascend  under which ten of voxware s engineers performed services for ascend at various times from february  through june  all ten of those employees became employees of ascend on june  cost of revenues cost of revenues increased  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in cost of revenues reflects increases in cost of product revenues and cost of services revenues 
cost of product revenues increased  from  in the fiscal year ended june  to  in the fiscal year ended june   reflecting materials  labor and overhead costs associated with hardware products related to the verbex business 
such costs accounted for the majority of cost of products revenues in fiscal as of june   voxware had a manufacturing staff of four compared to none at june  in fiscal  cost of products revenues represented costs related to our speech compression software licensing business  for which revenues declined significantly in fiscal since the industrial speech recognition hardware products business is a lower gross margin business than software licensing  cost of products revenues increased as a percentage of product revenues in fiscal cost of services revenues consists primarily of the expenses associated with customer maintenance support and engineering services  including employee compensation and equipment depreciation 
cost of service revenues increased  from  in the fiscal year ended june  to  in the fiscal year ended june  the increase in cost of service revenues is primarily attributable to voxware s services agreement with ascend 
under this agreement  ten of voxware s engineers performed services for ascend at various times from february  through june  for these services  voxware earned services fees which were based upon those employees salaries  and provided voxware lower gross margins than the gross margins on other services fees 
as a result  cost of service revenues increased as a percentage of revenues during fiscal as compared to fiscal operating expenses total operating expenses decreased by  from  in the fiscal year ended june  to  in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease primarily reflects headcount reductions in each of research and development  sales and marketing and administration  and other cost reductions associated with the restructuring of voxware s business focus over the past several quarters prior to the ascend and verbex transactions 
as of june   our headcount totaled  compared to total headcount of as of june  research and development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and equipment depreciation and lease expenditures related to product research and development 
research and development expenses decreased  from  in the fiscal year ended june  to  in the fiscal year ended june  as of june   we had a research and development staff of compared to at june  sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee compensation including sales commissions  travel expenses and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  from  in the fiscal year ended june  to  in the fiscal year ended june  as of june   voxware had a sales and marketing staff of compared to at june  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and fees for insurance  rent  office expenses and professional services 
general and administrative expenses decreased  from  in the fiscal year ended june  to  in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily realized through reductions in personnel  recruitment and general cost savings achieved through expense management 
as of june   voxware had a general and administrative staff of compared to at june  amortization of purchased intangibles totaled  for the fiscal year ended june  these intangibles related to the acquisition of verbex in february the total amount of intangibles capitalized from the verbex acquisition approximated  and those intangibles are being amortized over four years 
interest income interest income decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended june  from  for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease is primarily related to the decrease in voxware s total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments portfolio balance as a result of cash used for operations and the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of verbex for approximately  plus transaction costs in february as of june   voxware s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments portfolio totaled  compared to  at june  income taxes as of june   we had approximately  of federal net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in if not utilized 
as of june   we have provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset because of the uncertainty regarding realization of the deferred asset  primarily as a result of considering such factors as our limited operating history  the volatility of the market in which we compete  the operating losses incurred to date and the operating losses anticipated in future periods 
in addition  during  the state of new jersey passed legislation which allows new jersey technology companies to apply for the transfer or sale of unused new jersey state net operating losses and research and development tax credits for cash 
profitable companies can buy these losses and credits at a discount  thereby reducing their state tax obligation 
voxware applied to the state of new jersey to sell up to approximately  of its new jersey state net operating losses which  if approved  could provide voxware up to approximately  cash 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement with a broker who specializes in identifying buyers of new jersey net operating losses and tax credits 
we are currently awaiting a determination from the state of new jersey to determine what amount  if any  of voxware s state of new jersey net operating losses qualify to be sold 
we cannot assure you that these net operating losses will qualify to be sold or  if they qualify to be sold  that voxware will be able to identify a buyer for these net operating losses 
fiscal versus fiscal revenues we recognized revenues of  for the year ended june  compared to revenues of  for the year ended june  the decrease in total revenues is primarily attributable to our change in strategic focus from primarily targeting the multimedia software market in fiscal to primarily targeting the consumer devices and wireless communications markets in the latter half of fiscal the consumer devices and wireless communications markets are characterized by longer selling cycles than the multimedia software market  which impacted our revenues during fiscal for the year ended june   total revenues included  of total revenues from our largest customer  netscape 
netscape discontinued certain of its products during fiscal  including products which would incorporate our technologies  and consequently voxware and netscape entered into a second amendment of their software license agreement which terminated netscape s rights pursuant to their software license agreement 
license fee revenues for fiscal include a final payment of  from netscape pursuant to this amendment 
in addition  one other company accounted for of total revenues for the year ended june  we are not currently receiving any revenues from netscape  and we do not anticipate receiving any revenues from netscape in the future 
at june  netscape was not a stockholder in voxware 
at june  netscape was a stockholder in voxware 
for the year ended june   total revenues included  of total revenues from netscape 
in addition  two other customers each accounted for of revenues for the year ended june  product revenues product revenues totaled  and accounted for of total revenues for the year ended june  compared to  which accounted for of total revenues  for the year ended june  additionally  the decrease in product revenues as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal to fiscal is also attributable to our strategy of providing customized products to customers in the consumer devices and wireless communications markets 
this entails performing a higher level of engineering services for customers than did our previous business strategy 
as a result  we derived a greater portion of our revenues from providing services to customers in fiscal than in fiscal in fiscal  product revenues consisted of  in license fees of product revenues and  in royalties and recurring revenues of product revenues 
in fiscal  product revenues consisted of  in initial license fees of product revenues and  in royalties and recurring license fees of product revenues 
for the year ended june   product revenues included a total of  of total product revenues from our largest customer  netscape 
as detailed above  this amount was comprised of  in license fees and  in royalties and recurring revenues 
license fee revenues for fiscal include a final payment of  from netscape pursuant to this amendment 
for the year ended june   netscape accounted for approximately  of royalties and recurring revenues of total product revenues 
included in product revenues for the year ended june  is  in fees earned by voxware for product development efforts 
service revenues service revenues consist of customer support and engineering fees 
customer support services include providing updates and technical support to licensees of our products 
engineering services include providing technical resources and technical assistance to support customer specific development efforts  which include porting our technologies to specific hardware platforms and providing customized speech and audio solutions to customers 
during the year ended june   we recognized  in service revenues of total revenues  compared to service revenues of  of total revenues for the year ended june  this increase in service revenues was primarily attributable to increases in engineering fees earned from porting technologies to customers specific hardware platforms and in providing customized speech and audio solutions to customers 
the increase in service revenues as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal to fiscal is attributable to the decrease in non service revenues in fiscal caused largely by our revised strategy which focused on the consumer devices and wireless communications markets 
cost of revenues cost of product revenues consists primarily of costs of licensed technology 
cost of product revenues totaled  or of product revenues for the year ended june  compared to  or of product revenues for the year ended june  the decrease in cost of product revenues is directly attributable to the decrease in product revenues recognized during those periods 
cost of service revenues consists primarily of the expenses associated with the staffing of a customer support group and providing engineering services  which consist primarily of employee compensation and equipment depreciation 
cost of service revenues totaled  or of service revenues for the year ended june  compared to  or of service revenues for the year ended june  the absolute dollar increase in cost of services is directly attributable to the increase in service revenues during those periods  which includes a significant increase in non recurring engineering fees in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses total operating expenses decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease in total operating expenses primarily reflects headcount reductions in application development and support and other cost reductions associated with the strategic restructuring of our business focus 
a significant number of our personnel were engaged in researching  marketing and selling products in the consumer application software market during fiscal during fiscal  we restructured our business away from consumer application software and toward an oem model primarily targeting the consumer devices and wireless communications markets  which requires fewer personnel including employees and independent contractors than the consumer application software business focus in fiscal under the consumer application software model  voxware pursued a direct sales and marketing model  which required voxware to generate revenues by marketing and selling directly to independent software vendors  most of which were in the multimedia software market 
on the research and development side  voxware invested a significant amount of resources in developing a variety of applications incorporating voxware s speech compression technologies 
from a sales perspective  under the consumer application model voxware had an international sales force that called directly on independent software vendors  a technical support team that supported the direct sales force  and an inside sales and customer support team to answer end users questions about voxware s applications 
in addition  voxware invested considerable resources in developing marketing communications programs and materials for end users  and attending trade shows 
in contrast  voxware s oem model in the consumer devices and wireless communications market was an indirect model whereby voxware s objective was to target manufacturers of retail products who market and sell products incorporating voxware s technologies and pay voxware royalties on sales to end users 
this indirect model required a significantly lower cost and headcount structure than the consumer application software direct sales model  primarily because it relied on licensing core technologies that are customized for the respective licensee s platforms  rather than the development and marketing of products and applications to end users 
under an oem model  the objective is to license technology to customers who will then commit the development  marketing and sales resources necessary to distribute voxware s technologies through sales of the customer s product 
as a result  the size of voxware s development  sales and marketing teams were all significantly reduced in comparison to those under the consumer application model 
as of june   our resources were primarily dedicated to an oem model targeting the consumer devices and wireless communications markets 
as of june   our headcount totaled  compared to as of june  in connection with the decrease in headcount  in july we entered into a sublease agreement under which we subleased approximately of the space in our princeton office facility 
the initial term of that sublease agreement will expire on may  in comparing fiscal to fiscal  the overall decrease in total operating expenses was comprised of a  decrease in research and development expenses  a  decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a  decrease in general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  we decreased accrued expenses approximately  through reducing operating expenses by the same amount 
this amount related to estimates accrued in previous periods for certain liabilities and contingencies which are no longer deemed necessary 
the accrued expenses decrease during fiscal related to a legal contingency reserve of  which was included in general and administrative  software costs totaling  of which  was included in research and development   was included in sales and marketing and  was included in general and administrative and officer bonus accruals of  which were included in general and administrative 
in total  as a result of these reversals of liabilities accrued in prior periods  fiscal operating expenses were reduced by the following amounts and in their respective line items of the statement of operations research and development was reduced by  sales and marketing was reduced by  and general and administrative was reduced by  the legal contingency reserve relates to a loss contingency accrual of  and estimated legal costs of  accrued during the quarter ended september  in accordance with sfas accounting for contingencies 
as noted under the heading uncertainty regarding patents and proprietary rights on page of the company s form s  which became effective october   elk industries  inc asserted in two letters to voxware during the quarter ended september  that voxware s internet based streaming audio systems infringe us patent no 
 owned by elk industries 
at that time  we were engaged in marketing to vendors of internet based streaming applications  including our major customer  netscape 
during the quarter ended september   we accrued the amounts noted above in accordance with our policy of accruing the probable estimated loss from legal claims upon receiving notice of the claims 
the amount of this accrual represented an estimate of what we believed would be the minimum amount necessary to settle the claim of elk industries 
during the quarter ended december   we re evaluated the risk and considered that  among other things  approximately one year had passed without receiving any additional letters or other communications in regard to this issue  and we no longer viewed our sales opportunity in the internet based streaming applications market to be substantial 
as a result  we determined that the risk of loss under this contingency was now deemed minimal and reversed the accrual against the general and administrative line item of the statement of operations 
the software costs accrual relates to an accrual for a software purchase that was intended to provide a company wide solution  primarily for contract and account management for sales and marketing purposes  and also for product quality assurance and financial purposes 
in january  we signed a software license agreement with a vendor for an approximate value of  subsequent to signing the agreement  we became aware that the software package did not have the capabilities to meet our requirements 
we returned the software to the vendor  but recorded an accrual on the books until it appeared probable that the vendor would not enforce the contract and pursue legal action against us 
during the quarter ended march   after approximately one year had passed since we returned the software to the vendor  and since we had not been notified by the vendor of any claim  we determined that the accrual was unnecessary and reversed the accrual to the respective line items of the statement of operations 
the officer bonus accrual was originally recorded as of june  as an estimated bonus  including payroll taxes  for the year then ended for our then president and chief executive officer  michael goldstein 
in fiscal  approximately up until mr 
goldstein s resignation in october  our board of directors considered whether to pay mr 
goldstein any bonus for the year ended june  in fiscal  after mr 
goldstein resigned and we decided not to pay him any bonus for the year ended june   we reversed this accrual to the general and administrative line item in the statement of operations 
research and development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and equipment depreciation and lease expenditures related to product research and development 
research and development expenses decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease in research and development expenses primarily resulted from restructuring our business focus away from consumer application software and toward an oem model  which requires fewer personnel including employees and independent contractors than a consumer application software business model 
as of june   we had a research and development staff of compared to at june  sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee compensation including direct sales commissions  travel expenses  trade shows and costs of promotional materials 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the restructuring of our focus to an oem model  which requires less promotion and marketing than the previous consumer application software business model  as well as a decrease in the size of our sales force and marketing staff from at june  to at june  the decreases realized from the business model transition were partially offset by increases in expenses related to our sales offices in europe and asia which were opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and expenses incurred in connection with the formation of a product management and marketing function for the purpose of employing an oem business model in its target markets 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and fees for insurance  rent  office expenses and professional services 
general and administrative expenses decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily realized through reductions in personnel  recruitment and general cost savings achieved through expense management 
as of june   we had a general and administrative staff of compared to at june  interest income interest income increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase in interest income primarily relates to the timing of our initial public offering  which closed during november and december as the initial public offering occurred approximately four months after the start of fiscal  we earned approximately eight months interest income on the remaining net proceeds from the initial public offering during fiscal  as compared to a full year s interest income earned on the remaining net proceeds from the initial public offering during fiscal income taxes as of june   we had approximately  of federal net operating loss carryforwards for tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income  these such carryforwards begin to expire in deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
as of june   we had deferred tax assets of approximately  relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwards 
the net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had a total of  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments consisting of  of cash and cash equivalents and  in short term investments 
in september  we received  upon the closing of the ascend transaction and  was placed in escrow for a period of months to secure our indemnification obligations 
voxware also received a deposit of  from ascend in january which was restricted until the closing of the transaction  and is included in restricted cash current in the june  balance sheet 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments portfolio is liquid and investment grade  consisting of high grade money market funds  united states government backed securities and commercial paper and corporate obligations 
since inception  we have primarily financed its operations through the sale of equity securities 
cash of   and  was used to fund operations for the years ended june   and  respectively 
cash used for investing activities totaled  in fiscal  which was related to equipment purchases and the purchase of short term investments 
cash provided by investing activities totaled  in fiscal due to the liquidation of short term investments  offset by equipment purchase 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities totaled  reflecting voxware s purchase of verbex voice systems  inc and equipment purchases  offset by liquidations of short term investments 
for the years ended june   and  cash provided by financing activities totaled   and  respectively 
in fiscal   of cash was provided by financing activities  reflecting  in net proceeds from the initial public offering   in proceeds from the exercise of common stock warrants and options and  from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal   of cash was provided by financing activities  reflecting  in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and  from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal   was provided by financing activities  reflecting  in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and  from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
we have a  revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the bank s prime lending rate 
as amended on february   the credit facility requires voxware to secure all indebtedness with cash held at the bank s offices in an amount not less that of the outstanding amount of all indebtedness to the bank 
the credit facility requires payment of all outstanding principal  if any  plus all accrued interest on march  in connection with the lease of our office facility  we have outstanding a  standby letter of credit at june  naming the lessor of the office facility beneficiary of the standby letter of credit in the event that we default on the lease 
as required by the credit facility  we have secured the  standby letter of credit with cash that is included in other assets  net in the june  balance sheet 
in addition to the credit facility  the agreement with silicon valley bank provides a lease component in the amount of  for the purpose of providing a facility for the financing of the lease payments that we owe to an equipment lessor  of which none was outstanding as of june  we have no material commitments for capital expenditures except for those under operating leases for our facilities and leased equipment 
at june   our working capital totaled approximately  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances  together with the approximately  in cash received upon the closing of the ascend transaction on september   will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditures requirements  exclusive of cash required for possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products and technologies until at least june  year compliance the efficient operation of voxware s business is dependent in part on computer software programs and operating systems which it uses internally collectively  the internal programs and systems 
voxware s internal programs and systems consist of our accounting system  inventory system  payroll system  electronic mail system  telephone and pbx systems  and unix and microsoft windows nt servers 
all of these systems are based in house  with the exception of the payroll system  which is based at the vendor s facility 
we have been evaluating our internal programs and systems to identify potential year compliance problems 
we have primarily conducted these evaluations and assessments using voxware s information technology personnel  including coordinating evaluations and assessments with the respective vendors of these computer software programs and operating systems 
these actions are necessary to ensure that the internal programs and systems will be year compliant 
based on present information  we believe that we will be able to achieve year compliance through a combination of modification of some existing internal programs and systems and the replacement of other internal programs and systems with new programs and systems that are already year compliant 
we have recently completed the upgrade of our inventory system to one that is year compliant at a cost of approximately  which was paid for by verbex prior to the acquisition of verbex 
voxware did not have  and had no need for an inventory system until the acquisition of verbex 
we have been informed by adp  our outside payroll processor  that our payroll system is year compliant 
we have been informed by the vendor of our e mail system that the system is year compliant 
we are conducting our own internal assessment of the e mail system and we expect that assessment to be completed by the third calendar quarter of we believe that  to the extent that e mail system is not year compliant  we can receive an upgrade from the vendor or replace the system on a timely basis at no cost or at minimal cost 
our telephone and pbx systems have been upgraded to be year compliant 
we have no reason to believe that unix and microsoft windows nt servers are not year compliant or  to the extent that they are not compliant  that the vendors will not make appropriate upgrades available to all of their customers at no cost or at minimal cost 
in addition to our internal programs and systems  the products we sell and license externally to customers collectively  the external programs  have been assessed for year compliance 
with respect to the speech compression technologies and products historically sold by voxware  we are not aware of any year issues 
verbex had assessed its products  the mvp  speech commander and our stationary boards 
verbex concluded that it could be advisable for the users of those products to take precautions to mitigate possible year issues  such as not operating the product during the period of time when the calendar changes from december  to january  we have hired the director of engineering at verbex in connection with the verbex acquisition and we have commenced our own review of the year compliance of voxware s external programs 
while voxware is not yet aware of any year issues with our external programs that are expected to have a material financial impact on voxware as a result of our assessments to date  we continue to assess our external programs 
should we identify any material year problems  we are currently setting up a process that will enable us to contact our customers promptly so that we can provide instructions to mitigate or avert year issues related to the external programs 
we cannot assure you however  that in the event that we encounter year issues  we will be able to provide adequate instructions  or that our instructions will mitigate or avert year issues related to our external programs 
we may need to recall products and undertake to modify  upgrade or replace the products 
any such undertaking could be expensive and could have a material adverse effect on voxware and its financial condition 
to date  costs incurred in evaluating our internal programs and systems and external progrmas have not been material 
anticipated costs necessary to complete evaluations of our internal programs and systems and complete modifications and or replacements are not expected to be material 
we expect that the total cost of these efforts and upgrades should not exceed  including the cost of the upgraded inventory system described above 
voxware further estimates that less than than  of internal labor costs have been incurred to date for personnel working to resolve year issues 
we cannot assure you that our efforts and the efforts of our vendors will be successful in making all of our systems and products year compliant or that the cost and time required to achieve year compliance will not exceed our current estimates 
as a result  and due to uncertainty of the potential impact that year issues may have on voxware  there can be no assurance that year issues will not have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 
voxware expects to identify and resolve all year problems that could materially adversely affect its business operations 
however  voxware believes that it is not possible to determine with complete certainty that all year problems affecting voxware or its customers have been identified or corrected 
the number of devices that could be affected and the interactions among these devices are simply too numerous 
in addition  no one can accurately predict how many year related failures will occur or the severity  duration  or financial consequences of these perhaps inevitable failures 
as a result  voxware believes that the following consequences are possible
