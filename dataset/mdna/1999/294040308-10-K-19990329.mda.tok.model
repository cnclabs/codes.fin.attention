item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report 
certain statements made herein are forward looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of such statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements 
in particular  unanticipated changes in the economic  competitive  governmental  technological  marketing and other factors identified herein and in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission could affect such results 
general the company s revenues to date have been from i commercial operations  consisting of revenue from remediation services  conventional treatment systems and soil vapor extraction systems and the company s biological degradation systems including both in situ and ex situ bioremediation  and ii funds received from third parties and government agencies to conduct specific research and development programs 
while the company has realized significant commercial revenues for several years from remediation services and from traditional remediation systems such as soil vapor extraction systems  it has only recently seen the first substantial revenues from sales of full scale biological degradation systems for the treatment of contaminated air and water 
although great strides have been made in the commercialization of these systems  significant expenditures will be required for continued research and development  additional marketing activities and ultimately the development of manufacturing capabilities for the further commercialization of the company s biodegradation systems 
the amount and timing of such expenditures will vary depending on several factors  including the progress of development and testing  funding from third parties  the level of enforcement of environmental regulations by federal and state agencies  technological advances  changing competitive conditions and determinations with respect to the commercial potential of the company s systems 
the amount and timing of such expenditures cannot be predicted 
on april   the company acquired fluid management  inc fmi  a full service environmental consulting and engineering firm that is now operated as the company s wisconsin operations group the group 
remediation services and installation of traditional remediation systems are the group s core business and generate the greatest portion of the group s revenues 
pursuant to the wisconsin petroleum environmental cleanup fund act pecfa  a program funded by the state of wisconsin for cleaning up underground storage tanks  the group s clients or their lending banks are entitled to seek reimbursement for a majority of the remediation costs paid to the group 
the wisconsin department of commerce dcom reviews claims for reimbursement under pecfa to determine the extent to which submitted claims will be reimbursed 
typically the dcom review process is not completed until one to three years after the expense has been incurred and paid by the group s client or its bank 
this exposes the client to the risk that remediation expenses it incurred and paid ultimately may be disallowed for pecfa reimbursement by dcom 
the group has historically reimbursed its clients or their lending banks for the remediation costs for services provided by the group which ultimately were determined by dcom to be ineligible for reimbursement under pecfa 
in certain instances  the company has written guarantees to banks which  under certain conditions  could obligate the company to reimburse the bank for items disallowed under the program 
since the company acquired fmi  the company has reimbursed its clients and their lending banks an aggregate of  at december   the company had  in reserves with respect to potential ineligible claims related to approximately million in claims that had not yet been fully reviewed by dcom 
there can be no assurance that the amount of such reserve  which was determined by management based on historic reimbursement disallowance rates under the pecfa program  will be adequate 
on april   the state of wisconsin adopted new emergency rules emergency rules with regard to pecfa which effectively reduced the expected revenue per site that the wisconsin operations group can capture under the program for the foreseeable future 
the state of wisconsin s stated intent for issuance of the emergency rules was to reduce the amount of funds being paid for cleanup efforts under the pecfa program 
until the issuance of the emergency rules  the wisconsin department of natural resources dnr determined the appropriate remedial activity for each site under the program in every instance 
per the emergency rules  dnr s authority extends only to sites where groundwater contamination is evident 
where contamination of soil exists without groundwater contamination  dcom administers the remedial program with no dnr involvement 
under the emergency rules  lower cost natural attenuation is mandated unless certain conditions exist which would indicate that active remediation is necessary 
this is a significant change  since natural attenuation was previously not an approved option and virtually all sites were actively remediated 
based upon the company s experience  it is estimated that the active remediation approach under pecfa resulted in revenues ranging from  to  per site 
since the adoption of the emergency rules  the company s revenues from a typical site were reduced to approximately  to  this regulatory event has resulted  and is expected to continue to result  in a dramatic decrease in revenue  net income and cash flow from the wisconsin operations group 
the company is not aware of any proposed or pending changes to the pecfa program that would have a materially favorable impact on the business of the wisconsin operations group 
as a result of this event  the company reviewed the carrying value of the long lived assets associated with its acquisition of fmi and recorded a non cash charge of  in the second quarter of representing the impairment of the goodwill 
this charge is based on the amount by which the book value exceeded the current estimated fair market value of the goodwill 
the current estimated fair market value was determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows of the wisconsin operations group discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
the impairment charge fully eliminated the remaining carrying value of the goodwill associated with the fmi acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition of fmi in april  the company s results of operations during each of the years presented below may not be directly comparable 
results of operations compared to the company reported revenues in of  as compared to  for  an increase of 
the net loss applicable to common stock in increased to  from  in  while the basic and diluted net loss per share was compared to in the net loss includes the goodwill impairment charge of  per share taken in the second quarter 
commercial revenues net of reserves for ineligible pecfa claims increased to  from  in while revenues from corporate and government research and development contracts decreased to  from  in the increased commercial revenues are due primarily to increased sales of the company s services and products related to biological degradation systems  offset in part by decreases in service and conventional systems related revenues generated under the pecfa program at the wisconsin operations group 
an analysis of recent trends indicate an increase in the claims dcom is declaring ineligible for reimbursement  which resulted in an additional  charge against revenue in the fourth quarter of revenues from corporate and government research and development contracts decreased primarily due to the decreased volume of phase ii small business innovative research grants sbir the company is actively working on 
in  the company recorded initial revenues under two phase i sbirs from the national science foundation  two phase ii sbirs from the department of defense  as well as a phase ii sbir and a grant from the department of energy 
total costs and expenses increased to  or to  exclusive of the  goodwill impairment charge discussed above in from  in the cost of commercial operations increased to  in due to the inclusion of expenses of the wisconsin operations group for the entire year 
research and development expenses increased to  in due to an increase in internal development projects to develop new commercial products 
marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased to  in from  in due primarily to headcount reductions  other overhead expense reduction efforts and reduced amortization of goodwill associated with the fmi acquisition after recording the goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of interest income decreased to  in due primarily to the lower level of cash available for investment in equity in income of joint ventures amounted to  in compared to a loss of  in due primarily to the company s participation in the losses of the cvt america joint venture in on august   the company acquired the remaining of the venture  dissolved the venture and thereafter continued its business as part of the company s commercial operations 
compared to the company reported revenues in of  an increase of from the net loss applicable to common stock in increased to  while the basic and diluted net loss per share was compared to in the decrease in basic and diluted net loss per share is due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding primarily from issuance of common stock in connection with the fmi acquisition and a related private placement 
commercial revenues increased to  in from  in while revenues from corporate and government research and development contracts increased to  in from  in the increased commercial revenues are due primarily to the inclusion of sales of the company s wisconsin operations group  acquired on april  revenues from corporate and government research and development contracts increased primarily due to the increased volume of phase ii sbirs the company is actively working on 
in  the company recorded initial revenues under a phase i sbir from the national science foundation  three phase ii sbirs from the national science foundation  two phase i and one phase ii sbirs from the department of defense  as well as two other grants from the department of defense and the department of energy 
total costs and expenses increased to  in from  in the cost of commercial operations increased to  in due to increased revenue levels combined with the establishment of a  warranty reserve relating to systems and a  increase in reserve for bad debts to cover the write off of certain uncollectible receivables of the mwr operations group 
research and development expenses increased to  in due to an increase in work under corporate and government research and development contracts 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased to  due primarily to expenses of the wisconsin operations group  amortization of goodwill associated with the fmi acquisition  severance related expenses associated with the resignation of the company s former chief executive officer  and increased marketing expenses associated with the company s development programs 
in the company provided for a contract claim of  to cover the cost of repairing the biofiltration systems the company built for the nylonge corporation 
the repairs to the system were completed and the system restarted in late interest income increased to  due primarily to the increased level of cash available for investment as a result of the company s private placement of common stock in april equity in loss of joint ventures amounted to  in compared to  in due primarily to the company s participation in the losses of the cvt america joint venture 
on august   the company acquired the remaining of the venture  dissolved the venture and thereafter continued its business as part of the company s commercial operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations to date primarily through revenues from commercial operations  research grants from government agencies  public offerings and private placements of equity securities and research and development agreements with major industrial companies 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  additionally  the company had restricted cash of  that was being used to collateralize a bond for a large commercial project 
cash and cash equivalents decreased  from december  to december  as proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  were offset by cash used by operations of  and capital expenditures of  the company expects to incur additional capital expenditures in connection with the continued development and commercialization of its technologies 
the timing and amount of such expenditures will fluctuate depending on the timing of field tests  systems development activity  the rapidity with which the company s biodegradation systems can be further commercialized and the availability of capital 
furthermore  future projects may require the company to set aside additional capital to collateralize performance bonds 
revenue from certain of the company s contracts is recognized as services are provided and costs are incurred 
for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage relationship of costs incurred from contract inception to date to the estimated total costs for each contract 
the asset unbilled revenue represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
correspondingly  the liability deferred revenue represents billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
the balance in these accounts will fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including the number and size of fixed price contracts  contract terms and other timing and cost issues 
at december   unbilled revenue was  lower than at december  due primarily to lower revenue in the last quarter of versus the same period in accounts receivable decreased by  from december  to december  on lower fourth quarter revenue 
accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased by  from december  to december  primarily due to the payment in of bonuses and severance related to prior years and to lower state tax reserves 
on december   the company had  in reserve for claim adjustments and warranties   of which is attributable to potential pecfa claim adjustments related to approximately million in unsettled pecfa submittals and  of which is attributable to potential systems warranty claims and other contract issues 
it is anticipated that the company s currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash expected to be generated from operations will provide sufficient operating capital for at least the next to months 
the company may seek additional funds through equity or debt financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such additional funds will be available on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
other matters as of december   the company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately  for federal income tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income  if any  through the timing and manner in which these losses may be utilized are limited under section of the internal revenue code of to approximately  per year based on preliminary calculations of certain ownership changes to date and may be further limited in the event of additional ownership changes

the year issue readiness disclosure the year issue is the result of computer systems and other equipment with processors that identify a year with only two digits rather than four 
if not corrected  many computer applications and date sensitive equipment could fail or create erroneous results before  during and after the year the company utilizes information technology it systems such as computer networking systems and non it devices such as building security equipment  that are subject to potential failure due to the year issue 
the company has developed and implemented a plan to achieve year readiness the yk program 
the yk program is coordinated at the corporate level and is implemented by individuals in the company s offices throughout the country 
the yk program has been implemented in the following phases identification and assessment of all critical computer systems and equipment requiring modification or replacement  remediation or replacement and testing of modifications to critical items  evaluation of third parties  and development of contingency and business continuity plans to mitigate the effect of any system or equipment failure to the company s operations  systems and equipment arising from the year issue 
progress reports on the yk program will be presented regularly to the company s senior management and periodically to the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the year issue could affect the systems  transaction processing  computer applications and devices used by the company to operate and monitor all major aspects of its business  including financial systems  marketing services  proprietary engineering and procurement systems and technical reference databases 
with respect to business systems  such as general ledgers  human resources and payroll and field accounting software  phases and of the yk program are expected to be completed by june operating software  network capabilities and hardware are being addressed via upgrades 
completion of the upgrade process is expected by june a standard compliance process will be used to certify year compliance with vendors of purchased software 
remediation replacement and testing of the company s mission critical systems and equipment in use at the company s locations is expected to be completed by june mission critical items are those that might have a significant adverse effect in one or more of the following areas safety  environmental  legal or financial exposure and company credibility and image 
with respect to systems and equipment provided to clients  the company does not control and is not responsible for the upgrades  additions and or changes made by its clients  or by others for its clients  to those systems and equipment 
accordingly  the company does not provide to its clients any assurances  nor current information about year capabilities  nor potential year problems  with respect to past projects 
regarding current projects  the company is currently evaluating those projects for year readiness and determining whether any additional action is required 
the company relies directly and indirectly on external systems utilized by its suppliers and on equipment and materials provided by those suppliers and used for the company s business 
the company has established a procedure for reviewing year compliance by each of its suppliers 
as part of that process  the company has identified critical suppliers and is currently assessing the level of compliance for each 
the company requires its suppliers to certify and guarantee year compliance of their systems and equipment provided 
given the number of suppliers utilized by the company  compliance assessment is ongoing 
although initial reviews indicate that year compliance by the company s suppliers should not have a material adverse affect on the company s operations  there can be no assurance that suppliers will resolve all year issues with their systems and equipment in a timely manner 
the company uses both internal and external resources in its yk program 
the company has estimated that to date it has spent less than  primarily on software upgrades  on the year issue 
it anticipates spending an additional  to  for additional software upgrades  hardware modifications and administrative costs 
the program will be funded out of working capital and expensed as incurred 
the yk program has not affected any other it initiatives 
this estimate was derived utilizing numerous assumptions  including the assumption that the company has already identified its most significant year issues and that the plans of its third party suppliers will be fulfilled in a timely manner without cost to the company 
these costs are the company s best estimate given other ongoing systems initiatives 
however  there can be no guarantee that these assumptions are accurate  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
the company is developing contingency plans to address the year issues that may pose a significant risk to its ongoing operations and existing projects 
such plans will include the implementation of alternate procedures to compensate for any systems and equipment malfunctions or deficiencies with the company s internal systems and equipment  with systems and equipment utilized at the company s project sites and with systems and equipment provided to clients 
during the remediation phase of the internal business systems  the company has been and will be evaluating potential failures and will attempt to develop responses in a timely manner 
however  there can be no assurance that any contingency plans implemented by the company would be adequate to meet the company s needs without materially impacting its operations  that any such plan would be successful or that the company s results of operations would not be materially and adversely affected by the delays and inefficiencies inherent in conducting operations in an alternative manner 
the company s yk program is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control 
those risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  availability of qualified computer personnel  the year readiness of third parties and the year compliance of systems and equipment provided by suppliers 
no assurance can be given that the company will achieve year readiness 
further  there is the possibility that significant litigation may occur due to business and equipment failures caused by the year issue 
it is uncertain whether  or to what extent  the company may be affected by such litigation 
the failure of the company  its clients including governmental agencies  suppliers of computer systems and equipment  joint venture partners and other third parties upon whom the company relies  to achieve year readiness could materially and adversely affect the company s results from operations  liquidity or financial position
