all of these expenses have been paid out as of the end of the company s first quarter of fiscal interest income

certain factors that may affect future results except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements  and are based on current expectations  and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company  or industry results  to be materially different from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties associated with such statements include the following significant fluctuations and unpredictability of operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly for a number of reasons  including new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors  changes in pricing  and the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter 
historically a significant percentage of the company s net sales has resulted from orders booked and shipped during the third month of its fiscal quarter  a substantial portion of which occur in the latter half of that month 
the company has also in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and enhancements  and such delays may occur in the future 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
additionally  a significant portion of the company s operating expenses is relatively fixed  and operating expense levels are based primarily on internal expectations of future revenue 
as a consequence  quarterly operating expense levels cannot be reduced rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
concentration of sales on the macintosh platform 
to date  a majority of the company s sales relate to a single family of products running on the macintosh platform 
a decline in demand for these systems  or a failure of such systems to maintain market acceptance  as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
some of the company s products operate only on apple macintosh computers 
apple computer inc has suffered business and financial difficulties during the past several years 
in addition  the company believes that the market of users of the company s products increasingly views microsoft s windows nt operating system as an alternative platform for new digital video products 
as a result of the foregoing  there can be no assurance that resellers and customers will not delay purchases of apple based products or purchase substitute products based on non macintosh operating systems  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
the company currently anticipates significant growth in quarterly revenues of the company will not occur until new products based on the windows nt platform have been introduced by the company and have gained market acceptance 
rapid technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products and features in a timely manner to address customer requirements  respond to competitive offerings  adapt to new emerging industry standards and take advantage of new enabling technologies that could render the company s existing products obsolete 
in this regard  the company is developing new products that will operate on the windows nt platform 
the company currently anticipates that some of these new products will become commercially available during the first half of the company s current fiscal year 
the company also plans in fiscal to continue its investment in research and development  primarily in connection with the development of new windows nt based hardware and software products 
any delay or failure of the company in developing such additional new products or any delay or failure of such new products to achieve market acceptance  as a result of competition  blocking proprietary rights of third parties or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
risks associated with development and introduction of new products 
new product announcements by the company s competitors and by the company itself could have the effect of reducing customer demand for the company s existing products 
the introduction of new or enhanced products by the company also requires the company to manage the transitions from existing products 
new product introductions require the company to devote time and resources to the training of its sales channel in the features and target customers for such new products  which efforts could result in less selling efforts being made by the sales channel during such training period 
new product announcements or introductions could contribute to significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results as orders for new products commence and orders for existing products decline 
dependence on propriety technology 
the company s ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on its ability to protect its proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
the company has in the past received  and may in the future continue to receive  communications suggesting that its products may infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
the company s policy is to investigate the factual basis of such communications and negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more products  or relating to current or future technologies  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
there can be no assurance that these or other future communications can be settled on commercially reasonable terms or that they will not result in protracted and costly litigation 
risks of third party claims of infringement 
there has been substantial industry litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce any patents issued to the company or to enforce trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by the company  to defend the company against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
for a description of certain pending litigation instituted against the company  see item iii  legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
any such litigation could be costly and a diversion of management s attention  which could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in the loss of the company s proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from third parties or prevent the company from manufacturing or selling its products  any of which could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
emerging markets 
the broadcast  post production  business  and institution digital video segments to which the company is targeting its products are an emerging market 
many of the current users in this market rely on analog video tape processes 
digital editing alternatives are relatively new and currently account for a small portion of this market of current users 
the company also believes that this market includes a potential market of new users who currently out source their video production requirements 
the company s future growth will depend  in part  on the rate at which existing users convert to digital editing processes and the rate at which new users adopt digital video systems as a communications resource 
there can be no assurance that the use of digital video products like the ones offered by the company will expand among existing users of alternative video production processes or the market for new users  and any failure of the company s products to achieve market acceptance in these markets  as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
competition 
the market for the company s products is highly competitive and characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features and accelerate the release of new products 
a number of companies currently offer products that compete directly or indirectly with the company s products  including accom  inc  avid technology  inc  discreet logic inc  fast electronic gmbh  matrox electronic systems ltd  pinnacle systems  inc  and truevision  inc in addition  the company expects much larger vendors  such as apple computer inc  matsushita electric industrial company ltd  microsoft corporation  and sony corporation  to develop and introduce digital editing systems that may compete with the company s products 
many of these current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
as a result  such competitors may be able to develop products comparable to or superior to the company s products  adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies  evolving industry standards or customer requirements  or lower their product costs and thus be able to lower prices to levels at which the company could not operate profitably  the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
in this regard  the company believes that it will continue to experience competitive pressure to reduce prices  particularly for its high data rate systems 
the company has historically realized higher gross profit on the sale of its high data rate systems than its entry level systems  and such continued competitive pricing pressure could result in lower sales and gross margin  which in turn could adversely affect the company s operating results 
dependence on single or limited source suppliers 
the company is dependent on single or limited source suppliers for several key components used in its products 
the availability of many of these components is dependent on the company s ability to provide suppliers with accurate forecasts of its future requirements  and certain components used by the company have been subject to industry wide shortages 
the company does not carry significant inventories of these components and has no guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers 
there can be no assurance that the company s inventories would be adequate to meet the company s production needs during any interruption of supply 
the company s inability to develop alternative supply sources  if required  or a reduction or stoppage in supply  could delay product shipments until new sources of supply become available  and any such delay could adversely affect the company s business and operating results in any given period 
dependence on resellers 
the company relies primarily on its worldwide network of independent vars to distribute and sell its products to end users 
the company s resellers generally offer products of several different companies  including in some cases products which are competitive with the company s products 
in addition  many of these vars are small organizations with limited capital resources 
there can be no assurance that the company s resellers will continue to purchase the company s products or provide them with adequate levels of support  or that the company s efforts to expand its var network will be successful  any significant failure of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
reliance on international sales 
sales of the company s products outside of north america represented approximately of the company s net sales for the fiscal year ended november  international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  less effective enforcement of proprietary rights  currency exchange fluctuations  generally longer collection periods  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potential insolvency of international resellers and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
the company s international sales are also subject to more seasonal fluctuation than domestic sales 
in this regard  the traditional summer vacation period  which occurs during the company s third fiscal quarter  may result in a decrease in sales  particularly in europe 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s future international operations and consequently  on the company s business and operating results 
year readiness disclosure 
the year issue is the potential for system and processing failure of date related data and the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
to address these year issues with its major information technology systems  the company has initiated a program that is designed to deal with the company s internal management information technology systems 
the activities included in this program are intended to encompass all major categories of information technology systems used by the company  including manufacturing  sales  order entry  accounting and financial reporting 
the company has spent more than  over the past two years upgrading its internal management information technology systems 
the company has substantially completed an assessment of these information technology systems and believes that its information technology systems are year compliant 
however  the company utilizes third party equipment and software that may not be year compliant 
failure of third party equipment or software to operate properly with regard to the year and thereafter could require the company to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may also be vulnerable to any failures by its major suppliers  service providers and customers to remedy their own internal information technology systems due to year issues which could  among other things  have a material and adverse affect on the company s supplies and orders 
the company is unable to estimate the nature or extent of any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third parties  such as suppliers  service providers and customers  to achieve year compliance 
moreover  such third parties  even if year compliant  could experience difficulties resulting from year issues that may affect their suppliers  service providers and customers 
as a result  although the company does not currently anticipate that it will experience any material shipment delays from their major product suppliers or any material sales delays to its customers due to year issues  these third parties may experience year problems 
any such problems could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
other than the activities described above  the company does not have and does not plan to develop a contingency plan to address year issues 
should any unanticipated significant year issues arise  the company s failure to implement such a contingency plan could have a material adverse affect on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
to assist customers in evaluating their year issues as they may relate to the company s products  the company has assessed the capability of its current products and products no longer produced  to handle the year issue 
as a result of this assessment  the company believes that all current products shipping are year compliant  however  their can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability for the company s products will not have a material adverse affect on the company based on information currently available to the company  it does not believe that the year issues discussed above related to internal information technology systems or products sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition  however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters 
in addition  their can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by the company  its suppliers or other third parties will not have a material adverse affect on the company 
euro conversion 
on january   of the member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the euro 
as of january   the transition to the euro will be complete 
the company has operations within the european union and has prepared for the euro conversion 
the company does not expect the costs associated with the transition to be material 
the company s functional currency for accounting purposes is the u 
s 
dollar 
the overall effect of the transition to the euro may have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and financial results 
dependence on key personnel 
competition for employees with the skills required by the company is intense in the geographic areas in which the company s operations are located 
the company believes that its future success will depend on its continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees  especially in research and development
