item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rofin sinar is a leader in the design  development  engineering  manufacturing and marketing of laser based products used for cutting  welding and marking a wide range of industrial materials 
during fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were from sales and servicing of laser products for cutting and welding applications and approximately were from sales and servicing of laser products for marking applications 
the company s business strategy continues to include the expansion of its products and services  which may be effected through acquisitions 
the company  from time to time  reviews various opportunities to acquire businesses  technologies or products complementary to the company s present business 
currency exchange rates although the company reports its consolidated financial statements in us dollars  approximately of its sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily german marks  as well as french francs  italian lire  british pounds and japanese yen 
net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses 
exchange differences upon translation from each operation s functional currency to united states dollars are accumulated as a separate component of equity 
due to the cumulative strengthening of the us dollar against such foreign currencies during fiscal and  the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity changed from a million debit at september  to a million debit at september  the fluctuation of the german mark and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold and gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods

net sales of cutting and welding laser products increased million  or  but were partially offset by a decrease of million  or  in marking and microwelding products 
the increase in cutting and welding was due to improved demand in europe for co slab lasers to the machine tool market and for high power co welding lasers in the automotive industry 
the decrease in marking and microwelding was due primarily to lower shipments in the semiconductor electronics industry in asia 
on a geographic basis  net sales increased million  or  in europe asia and decreased million  or  in north america
