forward looking statements statements included in this report that are not historical facts  including statements concerning possible acquisition growth  regulatory compliance  year compliance  and the belief that the olp will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations and to enable it to distribute to the mlp sufficient funds to permit the mlp to meet its obligations with respect to the mlp senior notes issued in april  and sufficient funds to pay the minimum quarterly distribution per unit on all common units  are forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements 
the risks and uncertainties and their effect on the partnership s operations include but are not limited to the following a the effect of weather conditions on demand for propane  b price and availability of propane supplies  c identifying attractive acquisition candidates  acquiring them on economically acceptable terms  or successfully integrating them into our existing operations and making cost saving changes  d the availability of capacity to transport propane to market areas  e competition from other energy sources and within the propane industry  f operating risks incidental to transporting  storing  and distributing propane  g changes in interest rates  h governmental legislation and regulations  i energy efficiency and technology trends  j year compliance and k other factors that are discussed in the risk factor section of the partnership s most recent act filing with the securities and exchange commission  amendment no 
to form s registration statement  as filed february  year compliance many computer systems and applications in use throughout the world today may not be able to appropriately interpret dates beginning in the year year issue 
as a result  this problem could have adverse consequences on the operations of companies and the integrity of information processing 
the partnership began the process in of identifying and correcting its computer systems and applications that were exposed to the year issue 
the partnership initially focused on the systems and applications that were considered critical to its operations and services for supplying propane to its customers and to its ability to account for those business services accurately 
these critical areas include the retail propane accounting and operations system including related computer hardware  financial accounting and reporting system  supply and distribution accounting and operating system  payroll system  local and wide area networks and electronic mail systems 
the supply and distribution accounting and operating system  payroll system  financial accounting and reporting system  the retail propane accounting and operations system  and the local and wide area networks are believed to be year compliant 
the partnership is nearing completion of the conversion of the electronic mail system and the retail propane computer equipment and expects both to be year compliant by the beginning of november one of the key steps to achieving year compliance is the installation of new personal computers at nearly all retail outlets 
the partnership had planned the upgrade of the these computers for business reasons unrelated to year issues 
the partnership has acquired all necessary computers and is currently in the process of loading the appropriate software and delivering to each retail location 
the partnership has also taken steps to identify other non critical applications that may have exposure to the year issue 
it has established a separate company group to independently test these applications for year compliance 
to date  no material year issues have been identified as a result of this testing 
there can be no assurance that every system in every location where ferrellgas conducts business will function properly on january  in addition  there are other year risks which are beyond the partnership s control  any of which if wide spread could have a material adverse affect on the partnership s operations 
such risks include  but are not limited to  the failure of utility and telecommunications companies to provide service 
for these reasons  the partnership has developed a contingency plan should year problems temporarily affect any of our locations 
each ferrellgas location has been provided with a contingency plan that contains  among others  procedures to keep the partnership s plants operational  to access emergency management personnel  and to utilize cellular phones 
the partnership conducts business with several hundred outside suppliers 
while no single supplier is considered material to the partnership  a combined number could constitute a material amount to the partnership 
the partnership has reviewed its largest suppliers  particularly liquid petroleum gas suppliers  to obtain appropriate assurances that they are  or will be  year compliant 
this review included general public disclosures made by the supplier  general questionnaires and direct contact with suppliers regarding specific facilities 
while no supplier will provide assurances regarding year compliance or the effect from external factors on their operations  our review has indicated suppliers are addressing year issues 
if compliance by the partnership s suppliers is not achieved in a timely manner  it is unknown what effect  if any  the year issue could have on the partnership s operations 
the partnership has evaluated its year issues and does not expect that the total cost of related modifications and conversions will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
such costs are being expensed as incurred 
to date  the partnership has incurred approximately  to identify and correct its year issues 
this expense has been primarily related to its critical systems and applications 
it is estimated that in the remaining calendar year the partnership will incur an additional  to identify and correct its year issues 
the partnership does not anticipate significant purchases of computer software or hardware as a result of its year issue and does not believe that the correction of any year issues will delay or eliminate other scheduled computer upgrades and replacements 
despite the partnership s efforts to address and remediate the year issue  there can be no assurance that all critical areas and non critical applications will continue without interruption through january  and beyond 
general the partnership is engaged in the sale  distribution  marketing and trading of propane and other natural gas liquids 
the partnership s revenue is derived primarily from the retail propane marketing business 
the partnership believes that it is the second largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on gallons sold  serving more than  residential  industrial commercial and agricultural customers in states and the district of columbia through approximately retail outlets excluding area offices 
annual retail propane sales volumes were million  million  and million gallons for the fiscal years ended july    and  respectively 
the retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major oil companies  to its retail distribution outlets and then to tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  space heating  irrigation and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel  which is burned in internal combustion engines that power vehicles and forklifts  and as a heating or energy source in manufacturing and drying processes 
the partnership is also engaged in the trading of propane and other natural gas liquids and wholesale propane marketing 
through its natural gas liquids trading and wholesale marketing operations  the partnership is one of the leading independent traders of propane and natural gas liquids in the united states 
the partnership s traders are engaged in trading propane and other natural gas liquids for the partnership s account and for supplying the partnership s retail and wholesale propane operations 
the partnership primarily trades products purchased from its over suppliers  however  it also conducts transactions on the new york mercantile exchange 
trading activity is conducted primarily to generate a profit independent of the retail and wholesale operations  but is also conducted to insure the availability of propane during periods of short supply 
propane represents approximately of the partnership s total trading volume  with the remainder consisting principally of various other natural gas liquids 
for the partnership s fiscal years ended july   and  net revenues from trading activities were million  million  and million  respectively 
selected quarterly financial data due to the seasonality of the retail propane business  first and fourth quarter revenues  gross profit and net earnings are consistently less than the comparable second and third quarter results 
other factors affecting the results of operations include competitive conditions  demand for product  variations in the weather and fluctuations in propane prices 
the following presents the partnership s selected quarterly financial data for the two years ended july  fiscal year ended july  in thousands  except per unit data first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues     gross profit     earnings loss before extraordinary loss     earnings loss before extraordinary loss per limited partners unit basic and diluted net earnings loss     reflects a  extraordinary loss on early retirement of debt  net of minority interest of fiscal year ended july  in thousands  except per unit data first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter revenues     gross profit     net earnings loss     net earnings loss per limited partner unit basic and diluted results of operations fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  total revenues 
total gas liquids and related product sales decreased to  as compared to  in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in sales price per gallon as a result of the lower wholesale cost of propane experienced in the current year  the effects of warmer weather  and a decrease in revenues from wholesale propane marketing  partially offset by the effect of acquisitions of propane businesses 
the winter of fiscal was reported as the second warmest winter in recorded history 
for the year  temperatures were warmer than normal and warmer than the same period last year as reported by the american gas association 
a generally lower wholesale product cost environment experienced during fiscal caused a significant decrease in the sales price per gallon as compared to fiscal retail volumes increased by or  gallons  primarily due to acquisitions 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to  as compared to  during fiscal retail operations results increased primarily due to increased retail margins and an increase in volumes attributed to acquisitions  partially offset by decreased volumes attributed to warmer weather 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this year s operating expenses increased due to acquisition related increases in personnel costs  plant and office expenses  vehicle and other expenses and also due to performance and merit compensation increases 
vehicle and tank lease expense 
vehicle and tank lease expense increased by  due to the utilization of operating lease financing to fund fleet upgrades and replacements 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the overall average interest rate paid by the partnership on its borrowings as a result of the refinancing of fixed rate debt and existing revolving credit facility balances  partially offset by the effect of increased borrowings for acquisition and growth capital expenditures see financing activities following 
extraordinary item 
during fiscal year  the partnership recognized an extraordinary loss of  net of a minority interest of  the gross extraordinary loss included a payment of a premium and a write off of unamortized financing costs of  resulting primarily from the early extinguishment of  of its fixed rate senior notes 
fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  total revenues 
total gas liquids and related product sales decreased to  as compared to  in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in sales price per gallon as a result of the unusually higher wholesale cost of propane experienced in the previous year  the effects of the warmer weather  partially offset by acquisitions of propane businesses 
a less volatile propane market during fiscal caused a significant decrease in the cost of product  which in turn caused a decrease in sales price per gallon as compared to fiscal retail volumes decreased by or  gallons  primarily due to the decrease in volumes related to the unusually warm winter during fiscal  attributable in large part to the el nino weather phenomenon 
the winter of fiscal was reported as the third warmest winter in recorded history 
for the year  temperatures were warmer than normal and warmer than the same period last year as reported by the american gas association 
the warmer than normal temperatures were also compounded by other el nino related weather factors such as reduced wind chill  humidity  snow and cloud cover  all of which contributed to lower a demand for propane and a decrease in earnings for the partnership 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to  as compared to  during fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in retail sales gross margin dollars  partially offset by an increase from trading profits 
retail operations results decreased primarily due to decreased volumes attributed to the warmer weather  partially offset by the impact of increased retail margins and the increase in volumes attributed to acquisitions 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased slightly to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal fiscal year operating expenses were impacted by decreased variable expenses  resulting from reduced gallon deliveries due to the warmer weather  offset by increased expenses associated with acquisitions 
vehicle and tank lease expense 
vehicle and tank lease expense increased by  due to the utilization of operating lease financing to fund fleet upgrades and replacements 
interest expense 
interest expense increased over the prior year due primarily to increased borrowings for the financing of acquisitions  partially offset by a slight decrease in the average interest rate paid by the partnership on its variable rate borrowings 
liquidity and capital resources the ability of the mlp to satisfy its obligations is dependent upon future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic  financial  business and weather conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
for the fiscal year ending july   the general partner believes that the olp will have sufficient funds to meet its obligations and enable it to distribute to the mlp sufficient funds to permit the mlp to meet its obligations with respect to the  senior secured notes issued in april mlp senior secured notes and enable it to distribute the minumum quarterly distribution mqd per unit on all common units 
the mlp senior secured notes  the  olp senior notes new senior notes  the amended and restated olp credit facility credit facility and the additional olp revolving credit agreement additional credit facility see financing activities following contain several financial tests which restrict the partnership s ability to pay distributions  incur indebtedness and engage in certain other business transactions 
these tests  in general  are based on the ratio of the mlp s and olp s consolidated cash flow to fixed charges  primarily interest expense 
because the partnership is more highly leveraged at the mlp than at the olp  the tests related to the mlp senior secured notes are more sensitive to fluctuations in consolidated cash flows and fixed charges 
the most sensitive of the mlp related tests restricts the partnership s ability to make certain restricted payments which includes  but is not limited to  the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution mqd to unitholders 
although the mlp s financial performance during fiscal was adversely impacted by unseasonably warm temperatures  the partnership believes it will continue to meet the mlp senior secured notes restricted payment test during fiscal  in addition to meeting the other financial tests in the mlp senior secured notes  new senior notes  credit facility and additional credit facility agreements 
however  if the olp were to encounter any unexpected downturns in business operations  it could result in the partnership not meeting certain financial tests in future quarters  including but not limited to  the mlp senior secured notes restricted payment test 
depending on the circumstances  the partnership would pursue alternatives to permit the continued payment of the mqd to its common unitholders 
no assurances can be given  however  that such alternatives will be successful with respect to any given quarter 
because certain financial tests were satisfied during fiscal years  and pursuant to the agreement of limited partnership of ferrellgas partners  lp  the subordinated units converted to common units effective august  one of the primary financial tests applied to each of the three consecutive four quarter periods ending on july   and related to making the mqd on all common and subordinated units 
these financial tests are more fully described in note c to the consolidated financial statements provided herein 
future maintenance and working capital needs of the partnership are expected to be provided by cash generated from future operations  existing cash balances and the working capital borrowing facility 
in order to fund expansive capital projects and future acquisitions  the olp may borrow on existing bank lines  the mlp or olp may issue additional debt or the mlp may issue additional equity securities  including among others  common units 
toward this purpose  on february   the mlp filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the commission for the periodic sale of up to  in debt and or equity securities 
the registered securities would be available for sale by the partnership in the future to fund acquisitions or to reduce indebtedness 
also  the mlp maintains a shelf registration statement with the commission for  common units representing limited partner interests in the mlp 
the common units may be issued from time to time by the mlp in connection with the olp s acquisition of other businesses  properties or securities in business combination transactions 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended july   compared to  in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increased earnings before an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  the increased non cash employee stock ownership compensation charge  and the effect of trading operations and acquisitions on the net increase in receivables  inventory and payables 
investing activities 
the partnership made total acquisition capital expenditures of  during fiscal this amount was funded by  cash payments   of noncompete notes and other consideration and  of common units issued 
during the year ended july   the partnership made growth and maintenance capital expenditures of  primarily for the following purposes additions to partnership owned underground storage and related facilities  customer tanks and cylinders  relocating and upgrading district plant facilities  upgrading computer equipment and software and vehicle lease buyouts 
capital requirements for repair and maintenance of property  plant and equipment are relatively low since technological change is limited and the useful lives of propane tanks and cylinders  the partnership s principal physical assets  are generally long 
the partnership leases additions to its vehicle and transportation equipment fleet of light and medium duty trucks and tractors 
the partnership believes vehicle leasing is a cost effective method for meeting the partnership s transportation equipment needs 
the partnership continues to seek expansion of its operations through strategic acquisitions of smaller retail propane operations located throughout the united states 
these acquisitions will be funded through internal cash flow  external borrowings or the issuance of additional partnership equity securities 
the partnership does not have any material commitments of funds for capital expenditures other than to support the current level of operations 
in fiscal  the partnership does not expect an increase in growth and maintenance capital expenditures as compared to fiscal levels 
financing activities 
on august   the olp issued  of new privately placed unsecured senior notes new senior notes and entered into a  revolving credit facility credit facility with its existing banks 
the proceeds of the new senior notes  which include five series with maturities ranging from year through at an average fixed interest rate of  were used to redeem  of olp fixed rate senior notes senior notes issued in july  including a call premium  and to repay outstanding indebtedness under the then existing olp revolving credit facility 
because these financing activities occurred at the beginning of fiscal  the partnership does not expect a decrease in interest expense resulting from this transaction during fiscal the olp entered into an additional credit facility agreement on april  this new facility additional credit facility provides for a  unsecured facility for acquisitions  capital expenditures  and general corporate purposes 
the outstanding additional credit facility balance at april   may be converted to a term loan and will be due and payable in full july  see note e to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding the new senior notes  the credit facility and the additional credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the partnership s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices 
additionally  the partnership seeks to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on variable rate debt by entering into interest rate collar agreements 
the partnership has  in variable rate debt outstanding at july  moreover the partnership has only  notional amount of interest rate collar agreements outstanding 
thus  assuming a basis point change increase in the variable interest rate to the partnership  the interest rate risk related to the variable rate debt and the associated interest rate collar agreements is not material to the financial statements 
the partnership s trading activities utilize certain types of energy commodity forward contracts and swaps traded on the over the counter financial markets and futures traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex or exchange to anticipate market movements  manage and hedge its exposure to the volatility of floating commodity prices and to protect its inventory positions 
the partnership s non trading activities utilize certain over the counter energy commodity options to limit overall price risk and to hedge its exposure to inventory price movements 
market risks associated with energy commodities are monitored daily for compliance with the partnership s trading policy 
this policy includes specific dollar exposure limits  limits on the term of various contracts and volume limits for various energy commodities 
the partnership also utilizes loss limits and daily review of open positions to manage exposures to changing market prices 
market and credit risk 
nymex traded futures are guaranteed by the exchange and have nominal credit risk 
the partnership is exposed to credit risk associated with futures  swaps and option transactions in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
for each counterparty  the partnership analyzes the financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of each limit 
the change in market value of exchange traded futures contracts requires daily cash settlement in margin accounts with brokers 
forwards and most other over the counter instruments are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term 
sensitivity analysis 
the partnership has prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate the exposure to market risk of its energy commodity positions 
forward contracts  futures  swaps and options were analyzed assuming a hypothetical change in forward prices for the delivery month for all energy commodities 
the potential loss in future earnings from these positions from a adverse movement in market prices of the underlying energy commodities is estimated at  as of july  actual results may differ 
further discussion of the risk management activities and accounting for derivative commodity contracts is contained in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements
