overview the company is the entity resulting from the combination of ensys  ohmicron and sdi 
on august   ohmicron was merged with and into sdi  with certain ohmicron stockholders and note holders receiving shares of sdi common stock 
on december   sdi was merged with and into ensys 
the surviving entity was then renamed strategic diagnostics inc each of these transactions was accounted for as a purchase with sdi as the acquiring company and  therefore  the surviving company for financial reporting purposes 
as a result  the historical financial information discussed includes the results of sdi for all periods presented and the actual results of ohmicron from august  and ensys from december  ensys was formed in to develop proprietary biotechnology based test systems designed for fast and inexpensive detection of various chemicals in soil and water samples 
ensys raised approximately million in equity financing  including approximately million from the sale of  shares of ensys common stock in its initial public offering in october since  ensys commercialized eleven immunoassay test kits and four other test kits for the detection of various environmental contaminants 
ensys marketed and sold these test kits and other associated products and services to environmental consulting and engineering firms  hazardous waste processing firms  environmental testing laboratories  and various state and federal agencies through distributors and a regionally based direct sales force in the us ensys also marketed and sold its products in europe through ensys europe limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of ensys 
in march  ensys acquired from millipore  inc certain assets  which consisted primarily of inventory  work in process  equipment  intellectual property rights  contract rights and customer lists related to millipore s envirogard tm product line for million and  shares of ensys common stock 
ohmicron was founded in and began marketing its rapid assay r products in to the same general market and in the same fashion as previously described for ensys 
since its inception  sdi has focused on using proprietary technology and know how to develop  manufacture and market immunoassay test kits for applications primarily in the water quality  industrial testing and agricultural markets 
one of the strategies sdi used to develop its business was to establish relationships with other companies that had significantly greater resources and capabilities to evaluate market opportunities and potential for new products 
the company refers to these relationships as corporate partnerships 
corporate partners  who had identified and researched a market opportunity  funded sdi to develop and manufacture immunoassay products to meet the market need 
most of the corporate partner agreements were written so that sdi retained a right to manufacture the finished product  and any technology developed during the course of the project was co owned by sdi and its partner 
in this way  sdi developed proprietary technology and built a base of manufactured commercial products 
commercial operations of sdi were initiated with an agreement with a corporate partner a large integrated chemical company to develop an immunoassay test to detect certain corrosion causing bacteria 
this product was introduced in late and sdi purchased all rights and technology related to this product in in february  sdi entered into a million corporate partnership with em industries  inc an affiliate of merck kgaa  darmstadt  germany for the development and manufacture of a line of immunoassay test kits capable of identifying and quantifying targeted priority pollutants 
the first products under this agreement were introduced in through august  these products were manufactured by sdi and marketed by em industries  inc in september  em industries  inc and sdi reached an agreement whereby the february agreement was terminated  together with em industries  inc s marketing rights thereunder  in exchange for certain specified royalty payments to em industries  inc and shares of sdi common stock 
the marketing activities with respect to such products in the us are now the responsibility of the company 
since  the company has entered into research and development agreements with multiple corporate partners that have led to the introduction of various products to the water quality  industrial testing  agricultural and other markets 
these agreements generally provide that sales and marketing costs associated with a new product are borne by the corporate partner 
in addition  the company currently sells directly other products that it has independently developed or acquired 
the company believes that its competitiveness has been enhanced through the combinations of talents  technology and resources resulting from the mergers and acquisitions described above 
the company has also achieved meaningful economies of scale  operates from consolidated facilities in newark  de and is now offering its customers the most appropriate test for each specific customer application 
another key strategy that sdi used to develop its business was the formation in of tsd bioservices  a joint venture between sdi and a subsidiary of taconic farms of germantown  ny 
taconic farms is a privately held company whose business is the production and sale of mice and rats  primarily to the research community 
in  the joint venture was dissolved and sdi s interests were distributed into a wholly owned subsidiary  tsd bioservices  inc tsd 
the mission of tsd is to supply antibodies  especially monoclonal antibodies  immunochemical reagents and related services to medical diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  as well as the research community 
tsd s primary facility occupies approximately  square feet of space in newark  de 
on february   the company completed the acquisition of hti bio products  inc  a privately held manufacturer of custom and proprietary antibody products and services located near san diego  ca hti see recent developments 
the company believes that its products in the water quality  industrial testing and agricultural markets are unique and fill potentially large  unmet needs 
the company also believes that its products and technology currently being developed have broad application in diverse markets 
the company believes that its established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
the company experiences a seasonal pattern to its business 
sales of industrial and agricultural products are highest during the summer months with the lower levels of activity occurring during the winter months 
accordingly  revenues in any particular quarter may not be indicative of revenues for any subsequent quarter during the year  or for the year 
as sales of the company s analytical tests for water soluble polymers which are generally not affected by seasonal patterns and agricultural products to other parts of the world develop over the next few years  the company expects its seasonal fluctuations to become gradually less pronounced 
recent developments during the second half of  several significant developments occurred in the market for testing for genetically modified organisms gmos and the labeling of food products in europe 
earlier in  the european commission adopted rule  which requires over  food processors to test ingredients for the presence of gmos and label products accordingly beginning march  during the third quarter of  the company devoted significant resources to educate regulators and industry representatives concerning the features and benefits of its products  immunoassay based  protein test kits to detect the presence of gmos 
this work continued during the fourth quarter of and the company achieved several milestones during the second half of the joint research centre s food products unit of the institute for health and consumer protection jrc ihcp  the regulatory authority responsible for the validation of test methods reviewed the company s product plans and expressed interest in validating protein based test methods like those proposed by the company 
second  to commercially validate its methods  the company licensed certain proprietary proteins from leading agricultural biotechnology companies and conducted data trials with several commercial laboratories throughout europe 
in addition  the company participated in a jrc ihcp sponsored validation study of its soya test kit  which involved qualified laboratories throughout europe 
these trials are common in the food testing industry and are generally referred to as ring studies 
during the fourth quarter  the company and these laboratories completed these studies 
the jrc ihcp has informed the company that its products have been validated to detect the presence of the tested traits at the thresholds concentrations established in the ring study protocol 
the company has now begun to manufacture and market these products throughout europe  focusing its sales efforts on the early adopters and opinion leaders in the food process industry as described below 
the company began to introduce its technology and products to the leading food processors in europe during the third quarter of prospective customers have shown interest in the technology s ability to detect the presence of gmos above a specified threshold level  its fast time to result and its cost advantages 
this work continued during the fourth quarter of the company has formed a product focus group consisting of three of the largest food companies in the world 
the company expects that this group will be utilized to refer prospective customers to the company s technology and products 
on february   the company completed the acquisition of hti 
hti had revenues of million and pre tax profits of approximately thousand 
these results are preliminary and the company expects to complete an audit on or before may  hti  a primary manufacturer of antibodies and biochemicals  was founded in hti s products and services include custom antibody production  bulk antibody and biochemical products 
the company believes that these capabilities will afford it the ability to leverage its manufacturing costs  particularly in its test strip production for agricultural  food and water quality product lines 
these products utilize large quantities of polyclonal antibodies that the company previously purchased from third parties 
the company believes that hti s product lines will also enhance the company s exisiting capabilities in antibody production by adding extensive polyclonal products and services to the monoclonal products and services provided by its tsd bioservices subsidiary tsd 
the customers of hti are complementary to tsd s and share common characteristics in that they are primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing important medical diagnostics as well as leading medical research facilities 
the company believes that the combination and integration of these customer relationships will allow both tsd and hti to offer their customers broader product offerings and will help establish these companies as a single source for all of their customers antibody and biochemical requirements 
similarly  the company believes the integration of these operations will result in significant cost savings and be accretive to earnings 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues revenues increased million in or over this increase is the result of a million increase in product related revenues  offset by a thousand decrease in contract and other revenues 
product related revenues increased to million from million in from this growth in product revenues is primarily attributable to increases in sales of products in the agricultural category tests to detect traits in genetically engineered plants of million  tsd bioservices category custom monoclonal antibody production and purification of thousand and sales of other products includes the sale of a line of antibodies for thousand to a major customer and the thousand sale of pre commercial macra lp a test kits pursuant to the june supply agreement with a major customer  both occurring during the second quarter of million  all increases over the revenues recorded in these categories 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the industrial chemical category thousand  and water quality category million  when compared to the revenues recorded in these categories 
the decline in contract and other revenues is principally the result of the company s focusing its efforts on the food testing market during the second half of during the second half of  the company strategically refocused its efforts and devoted significant resources to enter the european market for food testing to detect the presence of gmos in agricultural commodities and food fractions that are used to manufacture finished food products 
this focus resulted in a reduction in contract and other revenues and an increase in research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million in  from million in to million in this increase is primarily related to an increase in the general business activity that occurred during the year and described below 
manufacturing expenses  which include the costs of products sold  increased thousand in to million 
increased costs in materials  labor and overhead were associated with the mix of products sold in versus research and development expenses increased thousand to million in from million in this increase was due to the higher costs of labor and materials associated with additional staff required to develop new  and modify existing  products for the company s entry into the european gmo food testing market 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in increased costs for public relations  sales consulting  advertising and travel were recorded as the company increased its exposure in the markets it serves 
additional expenses were incurred as efforts in the second half of were focused on the company s entry into the european market for gmo testing 
the company reorganized its sales and marketing efforts in the second half of to focus on this rapidly emerging opportunity 
this major reorganization included closing two sales offices in the industrial sales group  consolidating certain sales responsibilities to the company s headquarters and reassigning other individuals to cover the agricultural market 
net interest and other income net interest and other income increased thousand in to thousand  from the thousand earned in this increase is due to an increase in the level of invested balances maintained throughout the year 
net income net income decreased thousand in to thousand  from income of million reported in this decrease in net income is attributable to the increased costs  particularly research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  related to the company s entry into the european food market which more than offset increases in revenues  all as described above 
year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues revenues increased million in or over this increase is attributable to the increase in business activity after the mergers note and the increased sales of products in the company s emerging markets 
product revenues increased million or due primarily to increases in total product sales in emerging markets tests to detect  i proprietary polymers and ii traits in genetically engineered plants in agriculture to million from thousand in contract and other revenues decreased thousand or to million in the volume includes approximately thousand in revenues from transactions between ensys and sdi prior to the merger 
these businesses were integrated during operating expenses operating expenses decreased million or in to million 
this decrease is attributable to the inclusion in of a one time charge of million to write off research and development costs acquired in connection with the mergers 
excluding this charge  operating expenses increased million or as a result of increases in manufacturing costs of million or  research and development expenses of thousand or and selling  general and administrative expenses of million or 
these increases are all attributable to the higher costs of operation principally additional personnel and related costs of the combined companies 
net interest and other income net interest and other income increased thousand in from thousand in this increase is attributable to the increase in invested funds acquired through the mergers  offset by thousand of equity income recorded in as a result of the tsd bioservices dissolution note 
net income net income increased million in to million from a loss of million 
this increase in net income is attributable to the higher volume of revenues reduced in part by the increased costs and the one time write offs in all associated with the mergers 
liquidity the company s working capital  which consists principally of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  increased by thousand in to million at december  from million at december  this increase is attributable to the increases in accounts receivable of thousand  inventories of thousand and other current assets of thousand  and by reductions in accrued expenses of thousand and other current liabilities of thousand 
these were partially offset by decreases in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of thousand  and an increase in accounts payable of thousand 
under the terms of the agreement to acquire hti  the company paid approximately million in cash  issued  shares of series b preferred stock and assumed approximately thousand of long term debt 
the preferred shares convert into common shares on a for basis at any time at the option of the holder  and at the option of the company when the closing price of the company s stock exceeds for a period of days  and carry a cumulative  annual cash dividend of per share and a liquidation preference 
the company is also obligated to pay a percentage of net sales of certain products over the next three years  not to exceed million 
approximately million of acquisition financing has been provided by the company s commercial bank  with the balance coming from existing cash on hand 
for the year ended december   the company satisfied all of its cash requirements from cash available and on hand  and from a financing agreement with its commercial bank of thousand for specific equipment purchases and leasehold improvements 
at december   the company had thousand in long term debt and stockholders equity of over million 
the company believes it has  or has access to sufficient assets to meet its operating requirements for the forseeable future 
the company s ability to meet its long term capital requirements will depend on a number of factors including the success of its current and future products  the focus and direction of its research and development program  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation  the company s marketing and distribution strategy and the success of the company s plan to make future acquisitions 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to meet the future liquidity requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties see note to the consolidated financial statements 
year issues the company is aware of and is evaluating many of the year issues associated with both information technology it and non it systems which could cause problems and network failures should the systems fail to recognize year designations after the company is currently reviewing its own computer  communication  software and operating systems to determine if they are year compliant 
the company has planned system wide testing in the first quarter of for all internal network hardware and software  all enterprise system software and all user workstation hardware and software 
during the second quarter of  the company will test all internal and oem equipment 
any system failures will be addressed when detected 
the company expects that absent unforeseen negative results of its testing  its systems will be year compliant no later than july  accordingly the company has not conducted any contingency planning 
the company relies primarily on third party provided software purchased and licensed commercially  therefore the company believes its year risks are minimal 
as a result its historical and estimated future costs of remediation are now  and are not expected to become  material 
the company will continue to contact critical suppliers  collaborators and partners to determine if their operations  as they relate to the company  are year compliant 
the company cannot presently estimate the impact of the failure of such third parties to be year compliant 
although the company will take all practical measures to prevent problems related with the year programming issues  such problems and failures may occur which could seriously affect the company s progress 
because of the unprecedented nature of such problems  the extent of the effect on the company s progress cannot be certain
