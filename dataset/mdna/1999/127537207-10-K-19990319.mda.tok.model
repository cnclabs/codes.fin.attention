item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general on september   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of sun world 
the company s acquisition of sun world was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the consolidated financial statements include sun world from the date of acquisition 
in addition  in  the company changed its fiscal year end from march to december in order to align the company s year end with that of sun world 
results of operations the consolidated financial statements set forth herein for the years ended december  and and the nine months ended december   reflect the results of operations of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries  sun world since september   and southwest fruit growers swfg in which the company was the general partner and had an approximate percent partnership interest 
on november   the company purchased the assets of swfg and the partnership dissolved 
a summary of the sun world elements which management of the company believes is essential to an analysis of the results of operations for such periods is presented below 
for purposes of this summary  the term sun world will be used  when the context so requires  with respect to the operations and activities of the company s sun world subsidiary  and the term cadiz will be used  when the context so requires  with respect to those operations and activities of the company not involving sun world 
the company s net income or loss in future fiscal periods will be largely reflective of a the operations of the company s water development activities including the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program the program and b the operations of sun world 
sun world conducts its operations through four operating divisions farming  packing  marketing and proprietary product development 
net income from farming operations varies from year to year primarily due to yield and pricing fluctuations which can be significantly influenced by weather conditions  and are  therefore  generally subject to greater annual variation than sun world s other divisions 
however  the geographic distribution of sun world s farming operations and the diversity of its crop mix makes it unlikely that adverse weather conditions would affect all of sun world s properties or all of its crops in any single year 
nevertheless  net profit from sun world s packing  marketing and proprietary product development operations tends to be more consistent from year to year than net profit from sun world s farming operations 
as such  sun world continues to strategically add volume in the packing and marketing areas that will complement sun world s in house production or fill in contra seasonal marketing windows 
sun world has entered into agreements internationally to license selected proprietary fruit varieties and continues to pursue additional domestic and international licensing opportunities 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company s agricultural operations are impacted by the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry 
sun world has historically received the majority of its net income during the months of june to october following the harvest and sale of its table grape and treefruit crops 
due to this concentrated activity  sun world has  therefore  historically incurred a loss with respect to its agricultural operations in the other months during the year 
the cooler wet weather patterns experienced in california during the first half of delayed the harvest of all california grape and treefruit production by as much as four weeks from the harvest schedule and also reduced yields on certain crops which prefer warmer weather conditions  particularly early season table grapes in the san joaquin valley 
the table below sets forth  for the periods indicated  the results of operations for the company s four main divisions before elimination of any interdivisional charges  as well as the categories of costs and expenses incurred by the company which are not included within the divisional results in thousands year ended december  divisional net income farming   packing   marketing   proprietary product development   general and administrative   special litigation  litigation benefit  depreciation and amortization   interest expense  net   net loss   farming operations

farming profits from the coachella valley operations increased million from due to strong fob prices for peppers and watermelons and record table grape yields partially offset by lower table grape fob prices due to downward pressure from the record yields coupled with increased production from mexico 
farming profits for the desert lemon operations at blythe and cadiz increased million from due to strong yields and strong fob pricing experienced in farming profits from the san joaquin valley operations decreased million primarily due to reduced yields and higher harvest costs on the early season table grapes in the san joaquin valley 
these unfavorable results were partially offset by improved fob pricing on plums and the removal of certain underperforming peach and nectarine crops at the conclusion of the season 
farming profits for coastal sweet peppers were off million from primarily attributable to increased production costs 
packing operations 
during  sun world s four packing and handling facilities contributed million in revenues offset by million in expenses resulting in million in net income

the decrease in net income from packing operations is primarily attributable to the impact of reduced yields experienced in the farming operations during the year  particularly for the early season table grapes in the san joaquin valley 
during the year  sun world packed million units and moved an additional million units through the cold storage facilities for a total of million units processed through the packing operations 
in  sun world packed million units and moved an additional million units through the cold storage facilities for a total of million units 
products packed or handled during the year primarily consisted of sun world grown table grapes  treefruit  sweet red and yellow peppers  seedless watermelons and lemons  as well as table grapes and citrus products packed for third party growers

these unit sales resulted in marketing revenue of million while marketing expenses totaled million for resulting in a net income from marketing operations of million 
during  sun world marketed million units and generated revenues of million offset by expenses of million resulting in net income of million 
the decrease in units sold  revenues and net income primarily resulted from the decreased yields experienced in the farming operations  particularly the early season table grapes in the san joaquin valley

the partnership revenues relate to the operations of american sunmelon for the period from january  to october  and the revenues related to the distribution of proceeds from the partnership from the sale of substantially all of its assets to a third party on october  in addition  the increase in proprietary product development income is also attributable to the licensing agreement for the company s sugraone table grape variety entered into with the south african table grape industry in december revenues of million were recognized in related to current and past royalties for fruit sales and for past sugraone grapevine plantings 
net income of million for the year ended december  related primarily to the operations of american sunmelon

although yields for these crops were higher than normal  similar high crop yields throughout the industry resulted in lower prices 
as sun world was able to command a premium price for its proprietary products such as superior seedless tm table grapes and black diamond r plums  the impact of the industry wide lower prices were somewhat mitigated

liquidity and capital resources general discussion of liquidity and capital resources based on the million of cash at december  and the revolving credit facilities in place for both cadiz and sun world  as further discussed below  the company believes it will be able to meet its working capital needs over the next year without looking to additional outside funding sources  although no assurances can be made 
see current financing arrangements below 
under sun world s historical working capital cycle  working capital is required primarily to finance the costs of growing and harvesting crops  which generally occur from january through september with a peak need in june 
sun world harvests and sells the majority of its crops during the period from june through october  when it receives the majority of its revenues 
in order to bridge the gap between incurrence of expenditures and receipt of revenues  large cash outlays are required each year which are financed through a revolving credit agreement 
in april  sun world entered into a million one year facility the sun world revolver 
in february  sun world increased the sun world revolver to a million facility in conjunction with a one year renewal of the facility 
see current financing arrangements sun world below 
in order to provide additional availability of working capital and to provide a readily available funding mechanism for add on acquisition opportunities  cadiz entered into a three year million revolving credit facility the cadiz revolver in november current financing arrangements cadiz obligations as cadiz has not received significant revenues from its water resource activity to date  cadiz has been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence 
historically  cadiz has addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements with its lenders  private equity placements and the exercise of outstanding stock options 
as of december   cadiz was obligated for approximately million under a senior term loan facility 
with cadiz election to extend the facility in  the maturity date of the term loan is april  the company issued certain additional warrants in conjunction with the extension 
cadiz also has the right to obtain an additional one year extension 
the company is currently evaluating opportunities to refinance this term loan 
if the extension is exercised  cadiz would be required to issue certain warrants and the interest rate would be adjusted 
currently  the term lender holds a senior deed of trust on substantially all of cadiz non sun world related property 
the cadiz revolver is secured by a second lien on substantially all of the non sun world assets of the company 
principal is due on december  the company had million outstanding under the cadiz revolver at december  during  the company issued additional warrants in connection with borrowings under the cadiz revolver 
as the company continues to actively pursue its business strategy  additional financing specifically in connection with the company s water programs may be required 
responsibility for funding the design  construction and program implementation costs of the capital facilities for the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program will  under currently developed principles and terms  be shared equally by the company and the metropolitan water district of southern california metropolitan 
the company is analyzing various alternatives for funding its share of the estimated million to million cost of the program capital facilities 
these funding alternatives include a long term financing arrangements or b utilization of monies to be received from metropolitan for its initial purchase of  acre feet of indigenous groundwater 
the principles of agreement call for payment to cadiz of at least million for this initial groundwater 
based upon the results of analyses performed by investment banking firms retained by the company  management believes that several alternative long term financing arrangements are available to the company 
sun world obligations the first mortgage notes the sun world notes were issued in the principal amount of million on april  and will mature on april  the sun world notes will be redeemable at the option of sun world  in whole or in part  at any time on or after april  interest accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually on april and october of each year 
the sun world notes are secured by a first lien subject to certain permitted liens on substantially all of the assets of sun world and its subsidiaries  other than growing crops  crop inventories and accounts receivable and proceeds thereof  which secure the sun world revolver  and certain real property pledged to third parties 
the sun world notes are also secured by the guarantee of cadiz and the pledge by cadiz of all of the stock of sun world 
commencing october   sun world offered to exchange the exchange offer up to million aggregate principal amount of its series b first mortgage notes the exchange notes for million aggregate principal amount of the sun world notes 
the exchange notes are registered under the securities act of and have the same terms as the sun world notes

to meet its working capital needs for  sun world has renewed the sun world revolver for an additional year including an increase in the facility to million 
additionally  sun world has an intercompany revolving credit agreement with cadiz for seasonal working capital needs as needed 
no amount was outstanding under the intercompany revolver as of december  cash used for provided by operating activities 
cash used for operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash used for operating activities is primarily due to the elimination of the company s share of partnership operations related to the sale by american sunmelon of the majority of its assets in october as the cash distribution to sun world corresponding to the sale is included in investing activities

specifically  in july  the company and metropolitan approved the principles and terms for agreement for a water storage and supply program on the company s land in the cadiz and fenner valleys of eastern san bernardino county the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program 
the principles and terms for agreement provide that metropolitan will  during wet years or periods of excess supply  store surplus water from its colorado river aqueduct in the company s groundwater basin 
during dry years or times of reduced allocations from the colorado river  the previously imported water  together with additional existing groundwater  will be extracted and delivered  via a conveyance pipeline  back to the aqueduct 
during the year term of the agreement  metropolitan will store a minimum of  acre feet of colorado river aqueduct water in the company s groundwater basin and purchase a minimum of  acre feet of existing groundwater for transfer during dry years 
the program will have the capacity to convey  either for storage or transfer  up to  acre feet in any given year 
during storage operations  metropolitan will pay a fee per acre foot for put of water into storage and a fee per acre foot for return of water from storage  and a storage fee per acre foot every year that water is stored in the groundwater basin 
on the transfer of water  metropolitan will pay a base rate of approximately per acre foot  which will be adjusted according to a water price formula 
additionally  recognizing that delivery of the company s high quality  indigenous groundwater to the aqueduct provides a significant water quality benefit  metropolitan will pay the company a water quality fee for both transferred and returned water 
the program facilities  including spreading basins  extraction wells  conveyance pipeline and a pumping plant  are estimated to cost between and million  and both parties will share these costs 
all operational costs of the program  including annual operations  maintenance and energy costs  will be an obligation of metropolitan 
the principles and terms for agreement call for the establishment of a comprehensive independent groundwater monitoring and management plan to ensure long term protection of the groundwater basin 
the parties have commenced the environmental review process  which will include compliance with california environmental quality act and national environmental protection act requirements 
the final agreement may reflect adjustments to these principles and terms in order to reflect information identified during this review 
the final agreement will be presented to the respective boards of both parties for approval 
the program is anticipated to be operational by the year in addition to the development of its water resources  the company is actively involved in further agricultural development and reinvestment in its landholdings 
such development will be systematic and in furtherance of the company s business strategy to provide for maximization of the value of its assets 
the company also continually evaluates acquisition opportunities  which are complimentary to its current portfolio of water and agricultural resources 
with the acquisition of two citrus ranches in  the company will grow  pack and market additional boxes of citrus from december through march  which is contra seasonal to the company s primary farming operations 
this acquisition helps to further diversify the company s portfolio and enables the company to utilize its bakersfield packing facility during a previous period of limited utilization 
the company believes that  based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  sun world can adequately service its indebtedness and meet its seasonal working capital needs utilizing available internal cash  the sun world revolver and  if necessary  through an intercompany revolver with cadiz 
cadiz expects to be able to meet its ordinary working capital needs  in the short term  through a combination of cash on hand  quarterly management fee payments from sun world  payments from sun world under an agricultural lease whereby sun world now operates the company s  acres of developed agricultural property at cadiz  california  and the possible exercise of outstanding stock options 
except for the foregoing  additional intercompany cash payments between sun world and cadiz are subject to certain restrictions under its current lending arrangements 
since the company s inception  inflation has not had a material impact on the cost of materials required in the development of property or on labor costs 
similarly  the value of the company s real property has not been materially impacted by inflation 
in the event the rate of inflation should accelerate in the future  the company believes the increase in value of its real property will exceed any increases in costs attributable to inflation 
year the year yk issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in the company s activities and operations 
if the company or its significant suppliers or customers fail to make necessary modifications  conversions  and contingency plans on a timely basis  the yk issue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
the impact of the yk issue cannot be quantified at this time because the company cannot accurately estimate the magnitude  duration  or ultimate impact of noncompliance by suppliers  customers  and third parties that have no direct relationship to the company 
the company has established a corporate wide project team to identify and mitigate all yk issues 
the team has identified three categories of software and systems that require attention information technology it systems  such as mini mainframes  pcs  and networks  non it systems  such as equipment  machinery  climate control  and security systems  which may contain microcontrollers with embedded technology  and partner supplier and customer it and non it systems 
for each category  the project team is utilizing the following steps to identify and resolve yk issues inventory the systems  assess risks and impact of each system  prioritize projects  fix  replace  or develop contingency plans for non compliant systems  and test yk compliance 
the status of each of the major categories as of february is as follows information technology currently  various it remediation projects are at different phases of completion 
the company s assessments have identified three major internal it remediation projects as applications  pc based accounting and payroll systems  and pc based network servers and desktop computers 
the company s plan is to resolve compliance issues in critical business information systems by august  year compliance for as applications the ibm as hardware and operating systems are year compliant 
the company utilizes as applications for its sales order entry  accounts receivable  produce inventory  and grower accounting systems 
the primary year issue as it relates to the ibm as is that the core business applications software currently does not process nor store properly dates after december  currently  date storage fields are being expanded from six digits to eight digits for all affected display screens and reports where appropriate 
the company plans to have all programming and testing with regard to core business as applications completed by august  as of february   the company is approximately complete with the as project and remains on schedule to have the as applications year compliant by august  year compliance for pc based accounting and payroll systems the company utilizes commercial pc based accounting systems for its general ledger  accounts payable  project costing  purchasing  non produce inventory  payroll and human resource systems 
as of january  all required service packs to make these applications year compliant have been installed and tested 
year compliance on pc based network servers and desktop computers the company has contacted all significant pc based desktop and server system manufacturers to ascertain year compliance 
all significant pc based systems are either year compliant without any changes or will be with the installation of rom upgrades 
the company plans to complete the required rom upgrades by march  non it systems although no other areas of the business are expected to create year issues  the project team is continuing to review all areas of the business to determine year compliance 
management believes that given the agricultural nature of the company s business  the project team will not encounter any major yk issues which cannot be corrected or would have a material adverse affect on the company  although no absolute assurances can be given 
suppliers and customers it and non it systems the company has identified all significant suppliers and customers and has started the process of sending surveys and conducting formal communications to determine the extent to which it may be affected by those third parties yk preparedness plans 
in the absence of adequate responses and disclosures from major suppliers and customers  the company will attempt to make independent assessments 
however  a compliance failure by a major supplier or customer  or one of their suppliers or customers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
as a result  in some cases the company will develop contingency plans for suppliers and customers determined to be at risk of noncompliance or business disruption 
such plans could include finding alternative suppliers or manual intervention where necessary 
costs related to the yk issue are funded through operating cash flows 
the company presently believes that the total costs to obtain yk compliant systems will not exceed  which consists mostly of internal labor for programming and testing 
certain trends and uncertainties in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important risk factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements of the company made by or on behalf of the company 
the company wishes to caution readers that these factors  among others  could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any projected  estimated or forward looking statements relating to the company 
the following factors should be considered in conjunction with any discussion of operations or results by the company or its representatives  including any forward looking discussion  as well as comments contained in press releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  or other communications by the company 
in making these statements  the company is not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding the company s business or results  and is not undertaking to address how any of these factors may have caused changes to discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  certain of these matters may have affected the company s past results and may affect future results 
risks inherent in agricultural operations 
the company is subject to risks associated with its agricultural operations 
numerous factors can affect the price  yield and marketability of the crops grown on the company s properties 
crop prices may vary greatly from year to year as a result of the relationship between production and market demand 
for example  the production of a particular crop in excess of demand in any particular year will depress market prices  and inflationary factors and other unforeseeable economic changes may also  at the same time  increase operating costs with respect to such crops 
in addition  the agricultural industry in the united states is highly competitive  and domestic growers and produce marketers are facing increased competition from abroad  particularly from mexico 
there are also a number of factors outside of the company s control that could  alone or in combination  materially adversely affect the company s agricultural operations  such as adverse weather conditions  insects  blight or other diseases  labor problems such as boycotts or strikes and shortages of competent laborers 
the company s operations may also be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies  social and economic conditions  and industry production levels 
risks of water development projects 
the company anticipates that it will continue to incur operating losses from its non sun world operations until such time as it is able to receive significant revenues from the development of its water development projects  including the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program 
in addition to the risk of delays associated with receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and permits  the company may also encounter unforeseen technical difficulties  which could result in construction delays  and cost increases with respect to the company s water development projects 
the company is continuing to negotiate the terms and conditions of water storage and supply programs with various california water agencies including metropolitan with respect to preparing the final agreement for the cadiz groundwater storage and dry year supply program 
however  the outcome of other negotiations cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
the circumstances under which transfers or storage of water can be made and the profitability of any transfers or storage are subject to significant uncertainties  including hydrologic risks of variable water supplies  risks presented by allocations of water under existing and prospective priorities  and risks of adverse changes to or interpretations of us federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies 
other important risk factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the company or on behalf of the company are discussed elsewhere within this form k in the sections entitled seasonality  regulation  competition  year  and liquidity and capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations that impact the fair value of these obligations 
the company s policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
other instruments  such as interest rate swaps  options  floors  caps or collars may also be used depending upon market conditions 
no such instruments were used in the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interests rates  and fair values by year of scheduled maturities to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes in thousands of dollars
