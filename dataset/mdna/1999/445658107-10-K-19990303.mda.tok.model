additional capital spending for new revenue equipment is anticipated during  however  funding for such expenditures is expected to come from cash generated from operations and existing borrowing facilities 
year the company utilizes and is dependent upon a wide variety of complex information technologies it to conduct daily business operations 
some of the company s older computer software programs and equipment use two digit fields rather than four digit fields to define the applicable year 
as a result  some of the time or date sensitive functions of these programs and equipment could result in equipment shutdowns  miscalculations  inability to process data and or disruption of operations as the year approaches 
it is possible that some problems may develop during eg applications that utilize future or projected data  well before january  the company recognized the importance of year issues and developed an action plan in the plan includes systematic reviews of all internal hardware  software and functions to either verify that the system is year compliant or modify replace the software or system as required 
the process includes the use of a software testing tool which simulates the transition to the year the original plan contemplated all conversion efforts to be completed by the end of as of december   the majority of application programs ie software that interacts with users through computer terminals and produces reports had been modified or replaced 
these programs have been unit tested by it staff members  but still require detail testing by users and year simulation 
a number of the primary financial systems utilized to pay vendors  track customer accounts receivable and produce regular financial reports have been converted or are in the final stages of conversion to be year compliant 
the additional modifications  installations and unit testing of the company s internal computer and it applications are currently expected to be completed by july in addition to the issues and risks associated with the company s internal it systems and equipment  the company has relationships and is dependent upon a number of third parties that include customers and suppliers of goods and services 
daily business operations include the electronic data interchange of information edi with customers and providers of transportation services such as railroads and motor freight carriers 
other third party providers of critical services such as voice and data communications  natural gas and electricity  and diesel fuel are also an integral part of daily business operations 
if significant numbers or certain critical customers or suppliers experience failures in their computer systems or equipment due to year non compliance  it could adversely affect the company s normal business activities 
while some of these risks are not controllable by the company  a number of actions and procedures have been implemented to assess and or reduce this risk 
formal communications have been initiated with certain significant customers and suppliers 
depending upon the circumstances  formal certifications of year compliance have been requested and received 
the company has not received enough formal responses to date to make an accurate assessment of the year readiness of its primary customers and suppliers 
since  the company has spent approximately million on year compliance 
estimated future expense to complete testing and related compliance work is  for a total cost of million 
these costs are being charged to operations as incurred 
this cost estimate excludes certain new system acquisitions  development and implementation expenses that relate to on going business activity  normal upgrades and enhancements 
the company has also spent approximately million of acquisition and implementation costs for primary financial systems upgrades 
these costs are being capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software since these new systems were acquired for business reasons and not to remediate year problems  if any  in the former systems 
current estimated future costs for such financial systems upgrades are million 
the company presently believes that its internal computer systems and equipment will not pose significant operational problems relative to the year issue 
there can be no assurance that the company will properly identify all year issues or that certain external customers or suppliers will not experience disruption of it functions or actual services provided 
even short term disruption of telecommunications service  for example  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
in order to reduce the risks associated with the year problem  the company is developing a contingency plan which is expected to be completed by june  recent pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activities 
sfas requires an entity to measure all derivatives at fair value and to recognize them in the balance sheet as an asset or liability  depending on the entity s rights or obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
the recognition of changes in fair value of a derivative that affect the income statement will depend on the intended use of the derivative 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss on the derivative will be recognized currently in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for special hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative will either be recognized in income along with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged or be deferred in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
sfas will be effective for the company no later than the quarter ending march   sfas may not be applied retroactively to financial statements of prior periods 
the company has not determined the impact that statement will have on its financial statements and believes that such determination will not be meaningful until closer to the date of initial adoption 
forward looking statements this report contains statements that may be considered as forward looking or predictions concerning future operations 
such statements are based on management s belief or interpretation of information currently available 
these statements and assumptions involve certain risks and uncertainties and management can give no assurance that such expectations will be realized 
among all the factors and events that are not within the company s control and could have a material impact on future operating results are general economic conditions  cost and availability of diesel fuel  adverse weather conditions and competitive rate fluctuations 
future financial and operating results of the company may fluctuate as a result of these and other risk factors as detailed from time to time in company filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of its issuance of short term commercial paper 
however  due to its selective utilization of interest rate swaps  the effects of interest rate changes are mitigated 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if short term market interest rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
at december   the company s interest rate swap agreements had a fair value of million net liability position 
the company has no material future earnings or cash flow expenses from changes in interest rates related to its long term debt obligations as all of the company s long term debt obligations have fixed rates 
at december   the fair value of the company s fixed rate long term obligations approximated carrying value 
although the company conducts business in foreign countries  international operations are not material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  foreign currency translation gains and losses were not material to the company s results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  the company is not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the company s future costs or on future cash flows it would receive from it s foreign investment 
to date  the company has not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
