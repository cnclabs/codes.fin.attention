the company believes that its current cash position  funds generated from operations  funds available from its equity holdings in echostar common stock and its lines of credit will be adequate to meet its requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and external investment for the foreseeable future 
due to trading constraints on the ability to sell echostar shares and potential volatility of the value of the stock  there could be a significant reduction in funding available from the liquidation of echostar stock 
year the company is aware that many existing information technology it systems  such as computer and software products  as well as non it systems that included embedded technology  were not designed to correctly process data after december  the company has created a year project team to review  and evaluate the company s products  computer systems  test equipment systems and other non it systems 
the company determined that it was necessary to modify or replace portions of its software so that its it and non it computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond the company believes that with the modifications and conversions to new software  the year issue has been mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made  or are not completed in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has also initiated discussions with its suppliers regarding their plans to investigate and address their year problems  if any 
failures by the company s suppliers computer systems could adversely affect the demand for its products 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems  services  and products rely will be timely converted  or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have an adverse affect on the company s business financial conditions or results of operations 
the company has been using both external and internal resources to upgrade its commercial software programs for the year issue 
to date  the amounts incurred and expensed for developing and carrying out the plan have not had a material effect on the company s operations 
the total remaining estimated cost for addressing the year issue is not expected to be material to the company s operations and is included in the company s operating budget 
all remaining year issue costs will be funded through operating cash flows 
as the efforts of the year project team continue  the company may identify situations that present material year risks that will require substantial time and material expense to address 
in addition  if any customers  suppliers or service providers fail to appropriately address their year issues  such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  because a significant percentage of the purchase orders received from the company s customers are computer generated and electronically transmitted  a failure of one or more of the computer systems of the company s customers could have a significant adverse effect on the level and timing of orders from such customers 
similarly  if year problems experienced by any of the company s significant suppliers or service providers cause or contribute to delays or interruptions in the delivery of products or services to the company  such delay or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
finally  disruption in the economy generally resulting from year issues could also materially adversely affect the company 
although the year project team has not determined the most likely worst case year scenarios or quantified the likely impact of such scenarios  it is clear that the occurrence of one or more of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial conditions or results of operations 
the company s year project team s activities have included the development of contingency plans in the event the company has not completed all of its remediation programs in a timely manner 
in addition  the year project team has developed contingency plans in the event that any third parties who provide goods and services essential to the company s business fail to appropriately address their year issues 
there can be no assurance that such plans will be sufficient to address any third party failures or that unresolved or undetected internal and external year issues will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk on october  echostar announced it had signed a letter of intent to acquire media through the exchange of common stock 
on february  in connection with the purchase by echostar of media the company sold its interest in media in exchange for  shares of echostar common stock

this facility allows for a million operating line of credit 
funds borrowed under this line of credit bear interest at prime plus prime rate was at september  
certain assets of the company secure the line of credit and the company is required under this line of credit to be in compliance with a tangible net worth covenant 
the credit agreement expires july  the company s exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates primarily relates to the company s credit facility 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels prevailing at september   the fair value of the debt obligations would not change materially 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk 
notwithstanding the analysis of the direct effects of interest rate risk  the indirect effects of fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  worldwide demand for the company s products could be effected by interest rate fluctuations that could change the buying patterns of the company s customers
