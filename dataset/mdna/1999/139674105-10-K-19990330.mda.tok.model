factors affecting noninterest income are discussed below 
service charges on deposit accounts decreased  or  in  compared to an increase of  or  in service charge revenues in any one year are dependent on the number of accounts  primarily transaction accounts  and the level of activity subject to service charges 
the decrease in is primarily attributable to higher compensating balances and an increase in charged off deposit accounts

loan growth in was funded primarily through deposits acquired through acquisitions and maturities in the investment portfolio 
table provides information on average balances while table highlights the changing mix of the company s earning assets over the last three years 
loans local markets were generally improved during loan demand was steady and internal growth was spread evenly throughout the year 
the first federal florida acquisition completed in the first quarter of increased the number of markets served and enhanced the company s line of mortgage products and services 
price and product competition remained strong during and there continues to be an increased demand for fixed rate  longer term financing 
areas that reflected stronger demand were real estate  home equity and indirect automobile lending 
although management is continually evaluating alternative sources of revenue  lending is a major component of the company s business and is key to profitability 
while management strives to grow the company s loan portfolio  it can do so only by adhering to sound banking principles applied in a prudent and consistent manner 
management consistently strives to identify opportunities to increase loans outstanding and enhance the portfolio s overall contribution to earnings

as a percent of the total portfolio  loans with fixed interest rates have increased from in to in allowance for loan losses management attempts to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
the evaluations are based on the collectibility of loans and take into consideration such factors as growth and composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of potential losses  past loss experience and general economic conditions 
as part of these evaluations  management reviews all loans which have been classified internally or through regulatory examination and  if appropriate  allocates a specific reserve to each of these individual loans 
further  management establishes a general reserve to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio which are not specifically identified 
the general reserve is based upon management s evaluation of the current and forecasted operating and economic environment coupled with historical experience 
the allowance for loan losses is compared against the sum of the specific reserves plus the general reserve and adjustments are made  as appropriate

when establishing the allowance  management makes various estimates regarding the value of collateral and future economic events 
actual experience may differ from these estimates 
it is management s opinion that the allowance at december   is adequate to absorb losses from loans in the portfolio as of year end 
table provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan categories for each of the past five years 
the allocation of the allowance is developed using management s best estimates based upon available information such as regulatory examinations  internal loan reviews and historical data and trends 
the allocation by loan category reflects a base level allocation derived primarily by analyzing the level of problem loans  specific reserves and historical charge off data 
current and forecasted economic conditions  and other judgmental factors which cannot be easily quantified eg concentrations  are not presumed to be included in the base level allocations  but instead are covered by the unallocated portion of the reserve 
the company faces a geographic concentration as well as a concentration in real estate lending 
both risks are cyclical in nature and must be considered in establishing the overall allowance for loan losses 
reserves in excess of the base level reserves are maintained in order to properly reserve for the losses inherent in the company s portfolio due to these concentrations and anticipated periods of economic difficulties 
as part of its year contingency plan discussed on page  the company has reviewed its significant borrowers and allocated reserves to address the impact of the year issue

the company s nonperforming loans increased million  or  from a level of million at december  to million at december  during  loans totaling approximately million were added  while loans totaling million were removed from nonaccruing status 
of the million added  million was attributable to two relationships 
of the million removed from the nonaccrual category  million consisted of principal reductions  million represented loans transferred to ore  million consisted of loans brought current and returned to an accrual status and loans refinanced  and  were charged off

nonperforming assets to capital reserve to nonperforming loans for computation of this percentage  capital refers to shareowners equity plus the allowance for loan losses 
the majority of nonaccrual loans are collateralized with real estate 
management continually reviews these loans and believes specific reserve allocations are sufficient to cover the loss exposure associated with these loans 
interest on nonaccrual loans is generally recognized only when received 
cash collected on nonaccrual loans is applied against the principal balance or recognized as interest income based upon management s expectations as to the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest in full 
if interest on nonaccruing loans had been recognized on a fully accruing basis  interest income recorded would have been  higher for the year ended december  restructured loans are those with reduced interest rates or deferred payment terms due to deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
other real estate totaled million at december  versus million at december  this category includes property owned by capital city bank which was acquired either through foreclosure procedures or by receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
during  the company added properties totaling million including parcels of bank premises and partially or completely liquidated properties totaling million  resulting in a net increase in other real estate of  management does not anticipate any significant losses associated with other real estate 
potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has doubt as to the borrower s ability to comply with present loan repayment terms 
potential problem loans totaled  at december  loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amounts exceed of total loans 
due to the lack of diversified industry within the markets served by the bank and the relatively close proximity of the markets  the company has both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded 
further  due to the nature of the company s markets  a significant portion of the portfolio is associated either directly or indirectly with real estate 
at december   approximately of the portfolio consisted of real estate loans 
residential properties comprise approximately of the real estate portfolio 
management is continually analyzing its loan portfolio in an effort to identify and resolve its problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
as of december   management believes it has identified and adequately reserved for such problem assets 
however  management recognizes that many factors can adversely impact various segments of its markets  creating financial difficulties for certain borrowers 
as such  management continues to focus its attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential losses as they arise

in  average taxable investments decreased million  or  while tax exempt investments decreased million  or 
since the enactment of the tax reform act of  which significantly reduced the tax benefits associated with tax exempt investments  management has monitored the level of tax exempt investments 
the tax exempt portfolio  as a percent of average earning assets  has declined from in to in management continues to purchase bank qualified municipal issues when it considers the yield to be attractive and the company can do so without adversely impacting its tax position 
as part of the addition to the portfolio discussed above  municipal securities  totaling approximately million  were purchased during the fourth quarter 
the investment portfolio is a significant component of the company s operations and  as such  it functions as a key element of liquidity and asset liability management 
securities may be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale 
classifying securities as available for sale offers management full flexibility in managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting its regulatory capital levels 
securities in the available for sale portfolio are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities are recorded  net of tax  in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareowners equity 
at december   shareowners equity included a net unrealized gain of  compared to  at december  it is neither management s intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore the company does not maintain a trading portfolio

the company s credit facility imposes certain limitations on the level of the company s equity capital  and federal and state regulatory agencies have established regulations which govern the payment of dividends to a bank holding company by its bank subsidiaries 
based on the company s current financial condition  these limitations and or regulations do not impair the company s ability to meet its cash obligations or limit the company s ability to pay future dividends on its common stock at current payout rate

the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
at december   the company had million in commitments to extend credit and million in standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company uses the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
if commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels  management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact its ability to meet on going obligations 
it is anticipated capital expenditures will approximate to million over the next twelve months 
management believes these capital expenditures can be funded internally without impairing the company s ability to meet its on going obligations

inflation the impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property  plant and equipment 
assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature  and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices 
while the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates  interest rates react more to change in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of the company s ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled earnings analysis 
year compliance introduction the year issue creates challenges with respect to the automated systems used by financial institutions and other companies

significant borrowers were mailed a questionnaire and have been assigned a year risk rating by the company 
appropriate response to current and future credit requests will take their year status into consideration 
a similar assessment was conducted of deposit customers relative to liquidity risk 
investment and funding strategies have been planned to ameliorate any potential risk in this area 
continuation of these and additional activities are planned for the remainder of contingency planning 
the company is in the process of completing a business resumption contingency plan 
this plan will incorporate procedures for core business processes  in the event disruption of business occurs 
verification

management has identified the following potential risks which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s subsidiary bank may experience a liquidity problem if there are a significant amount of deposits withdrawn by customers who have uncertainties associated with the year the company has implemented a contingency plan to ensure there are appropriate levels of funding available

the company is in the process of incorporating a contingency plan for addressing this situation

if the businesses are adversely affected by the year issues  their ability to repay loans could be impaired and increased credit risk could affect the company s financial performance 
as part of the company s yk plan  the company has identified its significant borrowers  and has documented their year readiness and risk to the company 
sanctions could be imposed against the company if it does not meet deadlines or follow timetables established by the federal and state governmental agencies which regulate the company and its subsidiaries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk overview market risk management arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
capital city bank group does not actively participate in exchange rates  commodities or equities 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
interest rate risk management the normal course of business activity exposes capital city bank group to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rate risk may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
capital city bank group s asset liability management process manages the company s interest rate risk 
the financial assets and liabilities of the company are classified as other than trading 
an analysis of the other than trading financial components  including the fair values  are presented in table this table presents the company s consolidated interest rate sensitivity position as of year end based upon certain assumptions as set forth in the notes to the table 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity analysis is to measure the impact on the company s net interest income due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the asset and liability values presented in table may not necessarily be indicative of the company s interest rate sensitivity over an extended period of time 
the company is currently liability sensitive which generally indicates that in a period of rising interest rates the net interest margin will be adversely impacted as the velocity and or volume of liabilities being repriced exceeds assets 
however  as general interest rates rise or fall  other factors such as current market conditions and competition may impact how the company responds to changing rates and thus impact the magnitude of change in net interest income
