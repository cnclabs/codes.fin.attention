item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview simon transportation provides nationwide  predominantly temperature controlled truckload transportation for numerous major shippers 
in recent years  much of the company s growth has resulted from earning core carrier status with major shippers and meeting the demands of these shippers for additional equipment 
the company has grown to million in revenue for its fiscal year ended september   from million in revenue for fiscal  a compounded annual growth rate of 
from fiscal through fiscal  the company s pretax earnings grew to million from million  a compounded annual growth rate of 
the increase in pretax earnings was attributable primarily to revenue growth  greater equipment productivity  and the reduction in financing costs attributable to public offerings in and during fiscal  the company continued its strong revenue growth  with revenue increasing approximately 
pretax earnings decreased substantially  however  as the company experienced financial and operating difficulties 
for much of the year the industry wide driver shortage contributed to a substantial number of unseated tractors 
to address this problem  the company raised driver wages by a total of four cents per mile 
although management believes the higher wages have made the company more competitive in attracting and retaining drivers  the combination of unproductive equipment and higher wages adversely affected the company s profitability 
the company s financial results also were affected by unusually high accident claims and repair expense during the second fiscal quarter 
during fiscal year  management deferred deliveries of new tractors to better match the anticipated availability of drivers 
this reduced revenue growth for the year to compared with historical levels 
the company continued to experience financial and operating difficulties due to driver turnover rates far in excess of historical averages and the fact that driver pay increases effective in fiscal have not been offset by increases in the freight rates charged by the company 
management is focusing its efforts on reducing the rate of driver turnover 
in july the company reduced its shop and administrative personnel by approximately 
in comparing the company s historical financial position and results of operations  readers should be aware of changes in financing methods 
during fiscal year  the company financed most of its tractors and trailers with debt and capitalized leases 
during fiscal years   and  the company has financed most of its revenue equipment under operating lease arrangements 
financing equipment with operating leases increases the company s operating ratio because the implied interest component of the lease payments is reflected as an above the line operating expense rather than as interest expense 
the use of operating leases also affects the presentation of the statement of cash flows 
however  the method of financing does not affect net earnings or net cash flows 
the company s operating ratio may fluctuate from time to time based upon the method of equipment financing 
the company operated as an s corporation from october  to november  as a result  the company s net taxable earnings were taxed directly to the company s existing stockholders rather than to the company 
the pro forma statement of earnings data included in the selected financial and operating data set forth the company s net earnings for such periods as if the company had been subject to federal and state income taxes at a combined effective rate of for fiscal years and in addition to the ongoing income tax effect  the termination of the company s s corporation status resulted in a one time  non cash charge of approximately million during fiscal year in recognition of deferred income taxes 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to operating revenue for the periods indicated fiscal years ended september  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and benefits fuel and fuel taxes operating supplies and expenses taxes and licenses insurance and claims communications and utilities depreciation and amortization rent total operating expenses operating earnings loss gain on sale of real property interest expense and other  net earnings loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net earnings loss comparison of fiscal year ended september   with fiscal year ended september  operating revenue increased million  to million during the fiscal year from million during the fiscal year 
the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a increase in the weighted average number of tractors  to  during the fiscal year from  during the fiscal year  and an increase in average revenue per loaded mile to during the fiscal year from in the fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per tractor per week to  during the fiscal year from  during the fiscal year due to slower than expected freight demand in the company s second fiscal quarter and a significant number of tractors without drivers throughout much of the fiscal year  particularly the first and fourth quarters 
salaries  wages and benefits increased million  to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  salaries  wages  and benefits increased to of revenue during the fiscal year from during the fiscal year 
the increase is primarily attributable to the full effect of the two cent per mile driver wage increases effective april   and excess non driving personnel during most of the fiscal year 
in july  the company reduced its shop and administrative personnel by approximately 
as a result  management expects a decrease in salaries  wages and benefits as a percentage of revenue in future periods 
fuel and fuel taxes increased million  to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  fuel and fuel taxes decreased to of revenue during the fiscal year from during the fiscal year

depreciation was adjusted for a million net gain on the sale of revenue equipment during the fiscal year compared with a million net gain during the fiscal year 
rent increased million  to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  rent increased to of revenue during the fiscal year from during the fiscal year as the company added new equipment and replaced equipment that had been financed under capital lease arrangements with equipment financed under operating leases 
substantially all of the company s revenue equipment is financed through operating leases 
in addition  the fixed monthly rental payments were not as efficiently spread over lower revenue per tractor 
the company has utilized operating leases in the most recent year because of more favorable terms 
if the company continues to use operating lease financing  its operating ratio may be affected in future periods because the implied financing costs of such equipment are included as operating expenses instead of as interest expense 
as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating ratio increased to during the fiscal year from during the fiscal year 
interest expense and other  net decreased million  to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense and other  net decreased slightly to of revenue during the fiscal year compared with during the fiscal year

as a result of the factors described above  net earnings decreased million to a loss of million during the fiscal year from net earnings of  during the fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  net loss was of revenue in the fiscal year compared with net earnings of of revenue in the fiscal year 
comparison of fiscal year ended september   with fiscal year ended september  operating revenue increased million  to million during the fiscal year from million during the fiscal year 
the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to a increase in the weighted average number of tractors  to  during the fiscal year from  during the fiscal year

communications and utilities increased million  to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities increased to of revenue during the fiscal year from of revenue during the fiscal year primarily as a result of an access fee charged to the company by the owners of pay telephones based on calls to toll free numbers 
in addition  the fixed costs of utilities for the company s terminals and costs associated with the usage of the company s satellite tracking system did not remain proportionate with the decreased revenue per tractor 
depreciation and amortization decreased   to million in the fiscal year from million in the fiscal year

as a percentage of revenue  net earnings decreased to of revenue in the fiscal year from of revenue excluding the gain on the sale of the company s former headquarters in the fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business has required significant investment in new revenue equipment that the company historically has financed with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  equipment leases from third party lessors  borrowings under its line of credit  and cash flows from operations 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are funds provided by operations and borrowings and leases with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
during the  and fiscal years  the company financed most of its tractors with operating leases 
net cash used in provided by operating activities was million  million  and million  for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
the company s principal use of cash from operations is to service debt and leases incurred to purchase new revenue equipment and internally finance accounts receivable associated with growth in the business 
accounts receivable increased million   and million for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
the average age of the company s accounts receivable was   and days for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million  for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively  and consisted of net purchases of property and equipment 
the company expects capital expenditures primarily for revenue equipment and satellite communications units  net of revenue equipment trade ins  to be approximately million in aggregate for fiscal years and the company expects projected capital expenditures to be funded mostly with operating leases  borrowings and cash flows from operations 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million  million  and million  for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively

during fiscal year  the company purchased  shares of class a common stock at an average market price of per share for a total cash outlay of  the company purchased  shares at an average market price of per share for a total cash outlay of  in fiscal the maximum amount committed under the company s line of credit at september  was million 
as of september   the company had drawn million against the line 
the interest rate on the line of credit is percent above the day london interbank offered rate libor in effect from time to time 
at september   the company had other outstanding long term debt and capitalized lease obligations including current portions of approximately million  most of which comprised obligations for the purchase of revenue equipment 
as of september   the company s future commitments under noncancelable operating leases amounted to million 
see notes  and to consolidated financial statements 
the company s working capital at september    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
management believes that available borrowings under the line of credit  future borrowings under installment notes payable or lease arrangements for revenue equipment  and cash flows generated from operations  will allow the company to continue to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures  and obligations under debt and capitalized and operating leases at least through fiscal year inflation inflation has had a minimal effect upon the company s profitability in recent years 
most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
the company expects that inflation will affect its costs no more than it affects those of other truckload carriers 
seasonality the company experiences some seasonal fluctuations in freight volume  as shipments have historically decreased during the first calendar quarter 
in addition  the company s operating expenses historically have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
forward looking statements 
fuel availability and cost the company actively manages its fuel costs by requiring drivers to fuel at company terminals or  whenever possible en route  at service centers with which the company has established volume purchasing arrangements 
the company controls fuel purchases by using its proprietary software and qualcomm communications ability to schedule fueling stops and amounts purchased based upon fuel prices at locations on drivers routes 
the company historically has been able to pass through most increases in fuel prices and taxes to customers in the form of higher rates and fuel surcharges 
the company has fuel surcharge agreements with a majority of its customers 
however  the recent increases in fuel prices will not be fully offset by these surcharges 
year compliance the company has completed a review of each of its core systems to determine year compliance 
the company s billing  dispatch  edi  fueling  payroll  telephone  vehicle maintenance  and yard and equipment inventory systems and all other critical hardware and software systems were designed to be year compliant from inception 
the company has also completed its review and assessment of the year compliance status of its facilities and equipment 
all facilities and systems are year compliant with the possible exception of some older personal computers 
these computers do not perform date critical job functions 
the company will continue to replace these units during the normal course of business 
in april  the company installed a new mainframe to handle its core operating systems 
the company acquired the new computer as part of its normal course of business 
the prior machine continues to serve as a backup system 
both computers  peripherals and all operating software have been extensively tested by company personnel and we believe all are year compliant 
the company relies on qualcomm to provide the satellite tracking system necessary to track the location of its equipment  and to provide dispatch and routing information to its drivers 
the company has been informed that the software utilized by qualcomm and the company is fully year compliant 
the company utilizes comdata to transmit payroll funds to its drivers and to allow drivers to purchase fuel outside of the company s terminal locations 
the company has been informed that the software and systems utilized by comdata and the company is fully year compliant 
the company also interacts with many of its vendors through electronic data interchange edi 
the company has received written assurances from its significant vendors and customers representing approximately of its fiscal revenue that they will be year compliant 
although the company is year compliant in its edi applications  we cannot and do not guarantee the year compliance of our business partners systems 
the company has incurred internal staff costs necessary to review and further year compliance of its core operating systems 
because the systems were designed to be year compliant since inception  the costs have not had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company also incurred additional internal staff time to complete its compliance review of non core systems embedded in facilities and equipment 
these non core systems include microcontrollers contained in tractor engines and other components  refrigeration units  and terminal facilities 
the costs of such review were not incremental since they represented the redeployment of existing information technology resources 
the company believes that the most likely worse case scenario is the failure of some third party provided services 
the company anticipates that the risks related to its core and non core systems will be mitigated by ongoing assessment and correction of the systems 
the primary risk to operations is service disruption from third party providers that supply satellite communication  telephone  fueling and financial services 
any disruption of these critical services would hinder the company s ability to receive  process and track its freight or communicate with its customers and drivers 
forward looking statements 
a failure of the satellite communication system could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company is relying on the contingency plan established by qualcomm to prevent the interruption of business 
as an additional backup  the company plans to use its existing telephone systems to dispatch its equipment and provide support to its drivers in the event of a complete satellite system failure 
in the event of edi failures on the part of our customers  the company plans to use its telephone and facsimile system to receive load tenders from its customers 
the company would switch to paper invoices for its customers unable to use edi 
management believes that the company s current state of readiness  the nature of the company s business  and the availability of the contingency plans minimizes year risks 
management does not foresee significant liability to third parties if the company s systems are not year compliant 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements the company may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  the company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to the following economic factors  fuel prices 
negative economic factors such as recessions  downturns in customers business cycles  surplus inventories  inflation  and higher interest rates could impair the company s operating results by decreasing equipment utilization or increasing costs of operations 
increases in fuel prices usually are not fully recoverable 
accordingly  high fuel prices can have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
recruitment  retention  and compensation of qualified drivers 
competition for drivers is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers 
this shortage could force the company to significantly increase the compensation it pays to drivers or curtail the company s growth 
resale of used revenue equipment 
the company historically has recognized a gain on the sale of its revenue equipment 
the market for used equipment has experienced greater supply than demand in and if the resale value of the company s revenue equipment were to decline  the company could find it necessary to dispose of its equipment at lower prices or retain some of its equipment longer  with a resulting increase in operating expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are fluctuation in fuel prices and interest rates on our debt financing 
we are not engaged in any fuel hedging transactions 
thus  we are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices but are not exposed to any market risk involving hedging costs 
the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are interest rates on our debt financing 
our variable rate debt consists of a revolving line of credit  an unsecured term loan and an equipment finance term loan carrying interest rates tied to libor or the eurodollar rate 
these variable interest rates expose us to the risk that interest rates may rise 
at september   assuming borrowing equal to the million drawn on the line of credit and million on other outstanding variable rate loans  a one forward looking statements 
percentage point increase in the libor and eurodollar rate would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  the balance of our equipment financing carries fixed interest rates and includes term notes payable and capitalized leases totaling approximately million 
these fixed interest rates expose us to the risk that interest rates may fall 
a one percentage point decline in interest rates would have the effect of increasing the premium we pay over market interest rates by one percentage point or approximately  annually
