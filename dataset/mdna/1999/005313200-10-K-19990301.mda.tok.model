segment information segment and foreign operations information is contained in note segment information and foreign operations of notes to consolidated financial statements 
see also note recent pronouncements of notes to consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information and the possible impact of that standard on future disclosure by the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes its available cash resources  generated primarily from operations and credit lines  will provide adequate funds to finance the company s operations in fiscal if necessary  the company will seek to increase its credit line to support the company s future growth

financing activities provided million in cash in fiscal this was primarily attributable to common stock issued to employees under the company s employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
bank loans increased slightly  with million of borrowings outstanding under the company s lines of credit at september  compared to million at september   see note credit and borrowing arrangements of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  some based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
although the company s cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next fiscal year 
however  the company may need to increase its sources of capital through additional borrowings or the sale of securities in response to changing business conditions or to pursue new business opportunities 
should the company not be able to renew existing credit facilities  new sources of funding will be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional sources of capital will be available on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
business considerations from time to time  the company may disclose  through press releases  filings with the sec or otherwise  certain matters that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements including the forward looking statements contained in this form k are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  including without limitation those set forth below 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
litigation commencing in december  a total of eleven class action lawsuits were filed in federal court by or on behalf of stockholders who purchased company stock between january  and december  these actions name as defendants the company and certain of its present officers and directors 
the complaints allege various violations of the federal securities laws in connection with restatement of the company s financial statements and seek unspecified but potentially significant damages 
the company intends to contest these actions vigorously 
a stockholder derivative action  purportedly on behalf of the company and naming as defendants company officers and directors was also filed in state court seeking recovery for the company based on stock sales by these defendants during the above time period 
the company is also a defendant in various legal proceedings incidental to its business 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of these actions at this time  management is of the opinion that any unaccrued liability resulting from these claims would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
government regulation the design  clinical activities  manufacturing  labeling  distribution  sale  marketing  advertising and promotion of the company s products are subject to extensive and rigorous governmental regulation in the united states and foreign countries 
in the united states and certain foreign countries  the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory clearances or approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
there can be no assurance that any necessary clearance or approval will be granted the company or that fda or other regulatory agency review will not involve delays adversely affecting the company 
in addition  a failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions including warning letters  as well as civil penalties  injunctions  suspensions or losses of regulatory clearances  product recalls  seizure or administrative detention of products  operating restrictions through consent decrees or otherwise  and criminal prosecution  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
following an inspection in mid  cortet  inc  which the company acquired in may  received a warning letter from the fda concerning inspectional observations relating to the adequacies of cortet s quality assurance system 
cortet responded to the observations and the warning letter and received correspondence from the fda s florida district office indicating that cortet s responses appeared to adequately address the fda s concerns 
in mid  the state of california  under a contract with the fda  completed a routine inspection of adac s facility in milpitas  california 
the state investigator issued a fda form containing observations of non compliance of the recently implemented qsr 
the state investigator also placed a temporary shipment hold on pinnacle pending the company satisfactorily responding to the state s concerns regarding the company s quality systems 
the company promptly responded to the fda and the state and initiated a number of corrective actions 
the state lifted the pinnacle shipment hold on august  and  in september  adac received a letter from the fda indicating that the company had adequately responded to the fda s concerns 
although the company was deemed to have adequately responded to the state and fda following the foregoing inspections  the company is responsible for the full implementation of all corrective actions 
in addition  as all companies are  the company remains subject to periodic inspections in the future and there can be no assurance as to the timing or outcome of any subsequent inspection 
the scope of any re inspection could be more comprehensive than the inspections of cortet and the company s milpitas facility  and there can be no assurance that the fda  upon re inspection  will deem the company s corrective actions to be adequate or that additional corrective action  in areas not addressed in the warning letter or the form  will not be required 
any failure by the company to fully implement the required corrective actions or to comply with any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its products  and in more serious cases  could result in seizure  recall  injunction and or civil fines 
any of the foregoing  would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is also subject to ftc restrictions on advertising and numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection and disposal of hazardous substances 
changes in existing requirements  adoption of new requirements or failure to comply with applicable requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
competition the markets served by the company are characterized by rapidly evolving technology  intense competition and pricing pressure 
there are a number of companies that currently offer  or are in the process of developing  products that compete with products offered by the company 
some of the company s competitors have substantially greater capital  engineering  manufacturing and other resources than the company 
these competitors could develop technologies and products that are more effective than those currently used or marketed by the company or that could render the company s products obsolete or noncompetitive  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
dependence on new products and product enhancements adac s success is dependent upon the successful development  introduction and commercialization of new products and the development of enhancements to existing products 
because the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive  the company must continue to develop and successfully commercialize innovative new products and product enhancements such as forte  mcd pet  mcd ac pet and envoi in order to pursue its growth strategy 
the development of new products and product enhancements entails considerable time and expense  including research and development costs  and the time  expense and uncertainty involved in obtaining any necessary regulatory clearances 
failure of the company to develop  market and sell new products and enhancements effectively in future periods could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
future operating results the company s future operating results may vary substantially from period to period 
the timing and amount of revenues are subject to a number of factors that make estimation of revenues and operating results prior to the end of the quarter very uncertain 
the timing of revenues can be affected by delays in product introductions  shipments and installation scheduling  as well as general economic and industry conditions 
furthermore  of the orders received by the company in any fiscal quarter  a disproportionately large percentage has typically been received and shipped toward the end of that quarter  which is typical for the industry 
accordingly  results for a given quarter can be adversely affected if there is a substantial order shortfall late in that quarter 
in addition  although both the company s bookings and revenue have increased in recent periods  the company s bookings and backlog cannot necessarily be relied upon as an accurate predictor of future revenues as the timing of such revenues is dependent upon completion of customer site preparation and construction  installation scheduling  receipt of applicable regulatory approvals  customer financing and other factors 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that orders will mature into revenue 
the company has accounts receivable due from customers in latin america 
recent changes in economic conditions in that region  including the devaluation of brazilian currency  may adversely affect the company s ability to collect these accounts receivable 
if the company were unable to collect a substantial majority of these accounts receivable  the company s results of operations for a quarterly period could be adversely affected 
risks related to acquisitions in the past fiscal year  the company has acquired a number of small businesses  and anticipates that it may continue to acquire businesses whose products and services complement the company s businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  among other things  difficulties in successfully integrating the businesses including products and services  as well as sales and marketing efforts  failure to retain existing customers or attract new customers to the acquired business operations  failure to retain key technical and management personnel  coordinating geographically separated organizations  and diversion of adac management attention 
these risks  as well as liabilities of any acquired business whether known or unknown at the time of acquisition  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the company  including adverse short term effects on its reported operating results 
the company seeks to mitigate these risks by taking reserves when appropriate in connection with these acquisitions 
in addition  the company has in the past and may in the future issue stock as consideration for acquisitions 
future sales of shares of the company s stock issued in such acquisitions could adversely affect or cause fluctuations in the market price of the company s common stock 
year compliance the following statements are a year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only digit entries in the date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to fail 
as a result  in one year  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
the company is utilizing both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test its internal systems  for year compliance 
although management is continuing to assess the expense associated with internal year compliance  the company does not believe such compliance will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the company has completed an assessment and analysis of its internal information technology systems  software and manufacturing equipment 
the company has implemented plans to correct its internal year issues  and expects to have its remediation process substantially completed by early while the company currently expects that the year will not pose significant internal operational problems  delays in the implementation of new information systems  or a failure to fully identify all year dependencies in the company s systems  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company has established a program to assess its products to ensure that they are year compliant 
to monitor this program and to inform customers about the year issues with respect to its products  the company has created a website at www 
adaclabs 
com about yearhtml 
this website identifies the status of year compatibility of its products  including products that are year compliant  products that need free software updates  products that require hardware upgrades  and products that cannot be made year compliant 
this list is periodically updated as analysis of additional products is completed 
the company will sell  or provide under warranty or service contracts  software license upgrades to update the majority of its installed base to make the products year compliant  and anticipates completing development of such upgrades in mid for older equipment which the company no longer manufactures  the company will sell hardware upgrades to its customers which will address the year compliance where possible 
the company is contacting by mail customers which require computer hardware upgrades  and is also posting information relating to year compliance for its products on the company s website as described above 
the company is gathering information from its suppliers and vendors to determine the extent to which the company s capabilities are vulnerable to failure by those third parties to remedy their own year issues 
the company is currently receiving responses to those inquiries and anticipates that the analysis of this information will be completed by mid the company will proceed with further analysis or testing of its vendors systems as needed 
however  there is no guarantee that the systems and products of other companies on which the company relies will be timely converted or that they will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is in the process of developing a contingency plan 
this plan is expected to be in place in the first half of mid the inability of the company to develop and implement a contingency plan could result in a material adverse effect on the company 
the company currently estimates that total year costs will be approximately million  of which million has already been incurred 
these cost estimates do not include any potential costs related to any customer or other claim 
in addition  these cost estimates are based on current assessments of the ongoing activities described above  and are subject to changes as the company continuously monitors these activities 
the company believes any modifications deemed necessary will be made on a timely basis and does not believe that the costs of such modifications will have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  however  the company s expectations as to the extent and timeliness of any modifications required in order to achieve year compliance and the costs related thereto are forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may vary as a result of number of factors  including those described herein 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully modify on a timely basis such products  services and systems to comply with year requirements  which failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
in addition  the company is currently seeking to ensure that the software included in its products and other systems is year compliant 
failure or perceived failure of such products to be year compliant could significantly adversely affect sales of such products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues in a variety of ways 
many potential customers may choose to defer purchasing year compliant products until they believe it is absolutely necessary  thus resulting in potentially stalled market sales within the industries in which the company competes 
conversely  year issues may cause other companies to accelerate purchases  thereby causing an increase in short term demand and a consequent decrease in long term demand for the company s products 
additionally  year issues could cause a significant number of companies  including current company customers  to reevaluate their current system needs  and as a result consider switching to other systems or suppliers 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
health care reform  reimbursement and pricing pressure there is significant concern today about the availability and rising cost of healthcare in the united states 
cost containment initiatives  market pressures and proposed changes in applicable laws and regulations may have a dramatic effect on pricing or potential demand for medical devices  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by both government and third party payors  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
intellectual property rights the company s success depends in part on its continued ability to obtain patents  to preserve its trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
there can be no assurance that pending patent applications will mature into issued patents or that third parties will not make claims of infringement against the company s products or technologies or will not be issued patents that may require payment of license fees by the company or prevent the sale of certain products by the company 
reliance on suppliers certain components used by the company to manufacture its products such as the sodium iodide crystals used in the company s nuclear medicine systems are presently available from only one supplier 
the company also relies on several significant vendors for hardware and software components for its healthcare information systems products 
the loss of any of these suppliers  including any single source supplier  would require obtaining one or more replacement suppliers as well as potentially requiring a significant level of hardware and software development to incorporate the new parts into the company s products 
although the company has obtained insurance to protect against loss due to business interruption from these and other sources  there can be no assurance that such coverage would be adequate 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
product liability although the company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it deems sufficient for its business  there can be no assurance that such coverage will ultimately prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock is and is expected to continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in anticipated or actual operating results  market speculation  announcements of new products or technology by the company or its competitors  changes in earnings estimates by the company s analysts  trends in the health care industry in general and other factors  many of which are beyond the control of the company 
in addition  broad market fluctuations as well as general economic or political conditions or initiatives  such as health care reform  may adversely impact the market price of the common stock regardless of the company s operating results
