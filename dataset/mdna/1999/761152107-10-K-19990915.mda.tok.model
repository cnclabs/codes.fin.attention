recent accounting developments sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june and is effective for the company s quarter ending september  sfas standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the standard  entities are required to carry all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and  if so  on the reason for holding it 
if certain conditions are met  entities may elect to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values  cash flows  or foreign currencies 
if the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness as well as the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
accounting for foreign currency hedges is similar to the accounting for fair value and cash flow hedges 
if the derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
the company has not determined the impact that statement will have on its financial statements and believes that such determination will not be meaningful until closer to the date of initial adoption 
year the company conducted a number of reviews of its information systems during fiscal and fiscal  to identify all system upgrades required to facilitate the growth in business activity 
as a consequence of these review procedures  internal application systems have been substantially upgraded in recent years along with a strategic program to replace existing accounting systems with the oracle applications enterprise package 
the decision to replace the company s existing information systems was driven by operational requirements although  as a consequence of the oracle implementation and upgrade of other systems  the company expects all information systems to be fully year compliant by september while management expects the costs associated with year compliance to be approximately  the global cost of implementing the oracle application enterprise package once completed is estimated to be approximately the company has completed a review of its product lines for year compliance and  as a result of this review  believes there is no significant year exposure with regards to the company s products 
in addition to risks associated with the company s internal computer system  the company is potentially vulnerable to the failure of third parties to adequately address their year issues 
resmed continues to assess the readiness of key third parties by monitoring such parties readiness statements 
significant third parties with which the company interfaces include  among others  customers and business partners  technology suppliers and service providers and the utility infrastructure power  transport  telecommunications on which all entities rely 
the most likely worst case scenario is that a lack of readiness by these third parties would expose the company to the potential for loss  impairment of business process and activities and general disruption of its markets 
resmed is in the process of obtaining assurances from its major suppliers that they are addressing this issue and that products purchased by resmed will function properly in the year however  there is no assurance that the systems of third parties on which the company relies will be year ready  or that any system failure by such parties would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
beyond the above review procedures  the company is in the process of  and has developed  a number of year contingency plans should a year compliance issue arise 
however  there can be no assurance that customers  suppliers and service providers on which the company relies will resolve their year issues accurately  thoroughly and on schedule 
failure to complete the year project by december  could have a material adverse effect on future operating results or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources as of june  and june   the company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s working capital approximated million and million  respectively  at june  and the marginal decline in working capital balances primarily reflects funds used for construction of the company s new manufacturing facility 
beyond this expenditure  working capital balances increased due to increases in trade receivables and inventories partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
the company has financed its operations and capital expenditures through cash generated from operations and  to a much lesser extent  through sales of common stock 
during the fiscal years ended june  and  the company s operations generated cash of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of continued increases in net revenues  offset in part by increases in accounts receivable  inventory and prepayments 
given million expended on the new production facility  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale declined to million at june  from million at june   a decline of million 
during fiscal and  approximately million and million of cash was received upon exercise of common stock options 
the company s investing activities excluding the purchases and sales of marketable securities for the fiscal years ended june  and aggregated million and million  respectively 
the majority of the activities were for the construction of the new production facility and the purchase of production tooling and equipment 
to a lesser extent the company also purchased office furniture  research and development equipment and incurred costs associated with implementation of its new oracle applications computer system 
as a result the company s june  balance sheet reflects an increase in net property plant and equipment to approximately million at june   from million at june   an increase of approximately million 
the company anticipates spending approximately a further million for the ongoing implementation of its oracle computer system over the next twelve months 
these payments are to be funded through cash flows from operations and existing cash resources 
the results of the company s international operations are affected by changes in exchange rates between currencies 
changes in exchange rates may negatively affect the company s consolidated net revenue and gross profit margins from international operations 
the company has a substantial exposure to fluctuations in the australian dollar with respect to its manufacturing and research activities which is managed through foreign currency option contracts 
in may  the australian federal government agreed to lend the company up to  over a six year term 
such loan bears no interest for the first three years and bears interest at a rate of thereafter until maturity 
the outstanding principal balance of the loan was repaid during fiscal   remained outstanding at june  the company expects to satisfy all of its short term liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
foreign currency market risk the company s functional currency is the us dollar although the company transacts business in various foreign currencies including a number of major european currencies as well as the australian dollar 
the company has significant foreign currency exposure through both its australian manufacturing activities and international sales operations 
the company has established a foreign currency hedging program using purchased currency options to hedge foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities and manufacturing expenditure 
the goal of this hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates on the company s foreign currency exposures denominated in the deutschmark and australian dollar 
under this program  increases or decreases in the company s foreign currency denominated financial assets  liabilities  and firm commitments are partially offset by gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
the company does not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or purchased currency options for trading purposes 
the table below provides information about the company s foreign currency derivative financial instruments  by functional currency and presents such information in us dollar equivalents 
the table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including foreign currency call options held at june  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected contractual maturity dates for the company s foreign currency derivative financial instruments

aus dm aus dm aus dm forward looking statements from time to time  the company may publish forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects  technological developments  new products  research and development activities  patent and other litigation and similar matters 
there are a variety of factors that could cause the company s actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations include the following the market for products designed to treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions is characterized by frequent product improvements and evolving technology 
the development of new or innovative products by others or the discovery of alternative treatments for such conditions could result in the company s products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for the company s products is also highly competitive 
the failure of the company to meet the prices offered by its competitors  or offer products which either contain features similar to or more desirable than those products offered by its competitors or which are perceived as reliable by consumers could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
most of the company s competitors have greater financial  research  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors sell additional lines of products  and therefore can bundle products to offer higher discounts  or offer rebates or other incentive programs to gain a competitive advantage 
the company s competitors may also employ litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
the company s inability to compete effectively against existing or future competitors would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operating results have  from time to time  fluctuated on a quarterly basis and may be subject to similar fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations may result from the absence of a backlog of orders for the company s products  the introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  the geographic mix of product sales  the success of the company s marketing efforts in new regions  changes in third party reimbursement  timing of regulatory action  timing of order by distributors  expenditures incurred for research and development  competitive pricing in different regions  seasonality  the cost and effect of promotional and marketing programs and the effect of foreign currency transaction gains or losses  among other factors  in addition  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in the various countries in which the company conducts its operations 
the company s success is dependent upon the ability of the company s customers to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors for purchasing the company s products 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the prescribed device has not received appropriate united states food and drug administration fda or other governmental regulatory clearances  is not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods as determined by the payor  or is experimental  unnecessary or inappropriate 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
the cost containment measures that health care providers are instituting could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to sell its products and may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in some markets  such as spain  france and germany  government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of the company s products  subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations 
in australia and some other foreign markets there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat sleep disordered breathing related respiratory conditions 
a substantial portion of the company s net revenue is generated from sales outside north america 
the company expects that such sales will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net revenues in the future 
the company s sales outside of north america are subject to certain inherent risks of global operations  including fluctuations in currency exchange rate  tariffs  import licenses  trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies and foreign medical device manufacturing regulations 
the company has had foreign currency transaction gains and losses in recent periods 
a significant fall in the value of the united states dollar against certain international currencies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
other factors which could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial conditions include the costs and other effects of legal and administrative cases and proceedings  settlements and investigations  claims and changes in those items  and developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights and intellectual property licenses
