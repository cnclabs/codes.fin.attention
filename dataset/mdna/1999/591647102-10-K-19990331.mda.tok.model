item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and the description of metrocall s business in business 
overview metrocall is a leading provider of local  regional and national paging and other wireless messaging services 
through its nationwide wireless network  the company provides messaging services to over  us cities  including the top smsas 
since  metrocall s subscriber base has increased from less than  to more than million 
metrocall has achieved this growth through a combination of internal growth and a program of mergers and acquisitions 
as of december   the company was the second largest messaging company in the united states based on the number of subscribers 
metrocall derives a majority of its revenues from fixed  periodic usually monthly fees  generally not dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging services 
while a subscriber continues to use the company s services  operating results benefit from this recurring stream with minimal requirements for incremental selling expenses or fixed costs 
metrocall has grown internally by broadening its distribution network and expanding its target market to capitalize on the growing appeal of messaging and other wireless products and services  to gain access to different market segments and to increase the penetration and utilization of its nationwide network 
since december   the company has added approximately million new subscribers through internal growth 
over the past three years  metrocall has emphasized a number of distribution channels that are characterized by lower arpu  such as resellers  and correspondingly lower operating costs 
to offset declines in arpu and to capitalize on the growth of paging and other wireless messaging services  the company has expanded its channels of distribution to include  among others  company owned and operated retail outlets  strategic partnerships and alliances  internet sales  with each distribution channel focusing on the sale rather than the lease of pagers 
some of these channels tend to have higher arpu s than the company s strategic partners and typical resellers  who purchase service in quantity at wholesale rates 
furthermore  metrocall has been successful in marketing enhanced services  such as nationwide paging services  voice mail and other ancillary services for its strategic partners and other alliances 
the company has also grown significantly through mergers and acquisitions 
since july  metrocall has acquired the following companies  adding approximately million subscribers to its subscriber base 
acquisition acquired company date number of subscribers parkway july   satellite august   a network november   page america july   pronet december   amd october   total  on october   metrocall continued its consolidation efforts by acquiring amd  the paging operations of at t  which increased its customer base by adding approximately million subscribers 
as part of the acquisition  metrocall also acquired the npcs license 
metrocall expects to realize the following benefits from the amd acquisition greater scale and scope 
the amd acquisition increases the company s geographic presence to include alaska  arkansas  colorado  kansas  minnesota  missouri  oklahoma  oregon  utah and washington 
in addition  it adds to the company s existing presence in the northeast  southeast  midwest  mid atlantic and southwest and west 
premium  high revenue customer base 
the amd acquisition adds premium  high revenue subscribers to the company s existing customer base 
amd s arpu has historically been higher than the paging industry average 
amd provided its paging and messaging services to large business customers  which typically generated a higher arpu than individual customers 
approximately of amd s subscribers were high arpu alphanumeric customers  one of the highest percentages in the paging industry 
synergies 
as metrocall continues to integrate amd s paging operations with its own paging operations  metrocall expects to realize significant synergies 
for example  amd provided nationwide paging services without the benefit of a nationwide network 
as a result  amd spent million in reselling other carriers services  which adversely affected its margins 
over time  the company expects to switch a portion of amd s customers to its nationwide network  which will reduce third party costs and increase the utilization of its network 
in addition  metrocall expects to realize significant annual cost savings from elimination of duplicative amd functions 
the company expects to complete the integration of amd by the fourth quarter of metrocall cannot assure you that it will be able to integrate amd successfully or achieve the expected synergies 
metrocall s growth  whether internal or through consolidation  requires significant capital investment for paging equipment and technical infrastructure 
the company also purchases pagers for that portion of its subscriber base that it leases pagers to 
during the year ended december   capital expenditures totaled million  which included approximately million for pagers  representing increases in pagers on hand and net increases and maintenance to the pager base 
metrocall estimates that capital expenditures for the year ending december  will approximate million 
results of operations the definitions below will be helpful in understanding the discussion of metrocall s results of operations 
service  rent and maintenance revenues include primarily monthly  quarterly  semi annually and annually billed recurring revenue  not generally dependent on usage  charged to subscribers for paging and related services such as voice mail and pager repair and replacement 
service  rent and maintenance revenues also include revenues derived from cellular and long distance services 
net revenues include service  rent and maintenance revenues and sales of customer owned and maintained coam pagers less net book value of products sold 
service  rent and maintenance expenses include costs related to the management  operation and maintenance of the company s network systems and customer support centers 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and administrative costs of the company s sales force and related marketing and advertising expenses 
general and administrative expenses include costs related to executive management  accounting  office telephone  repairs and maintenance  management information systems  rent and employee benefits 
year ended december  compared with december  the following table sets forth the amounts of revenues and the percentages of net revenues defined as total revenues less the net book value of products sold represented by certain items in metrocall s consolidated statements of operations and certain other information for fiscal years and of of increase revenues revenues revenues or decrease service  rent and maintenance    product sales    total revenues    net book value of products sold    net revenues    arpu number of subscribers    service  rent and maintenance revenues 
service  rent and maintenance revenues increased approximately million from million in to million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to the growth in the company s subscriber base 
in  metrocall added approximately  subscribers or through internal growth and added approximately million subscribers or through the amd acquisition 
also in service  rent and maintenance revenues included those revenues generated from the million subscriber base acquired in the december  pronet merger for which no revenues were recognized during and the million subscribers metrocall acquired from the amd acquisition on october  the decline in monthly arpu of per unit from to was attributable to the company s subscriber distribution mix and the related increase in its lower arpu indirect reseller distribution channel 
the decline in arpu was partially offset by the increase in the company s rental base due to the amd acquisition  as amd had higher revenue rental subscribers 
factors affecting arpu in future periods include  among other things  distribution mix of new subscribers  competition and new technologies 
metrocall cannot assure that arpu will not decline in future periods 
product sales revenues 
product sales revenues increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in net book value of products sold increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in the increase in product sales revenues was directly attributable to higher unit sales and greater geographic penetration related to the pronet merger and the amd acquisition 
metrocall s gross margin on product sales increased from in to in as a result of increased depreciation taken on units sold that resulted in a lower book value and higher margin at the sales date 
pagers are classified as property and depreciated from the date of acquisition 
the following tables set forth the amounts of operating expenses and related percentages of net revenues represented by certain items in metrocall s consolidated statements of operations and certain other information for fiscal years and of of operating expenses revenues revenues increase service  rent and maintenance    selling and marketing    general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    operating expenses per unit in service decrease monthly service  rent and maintenance monthly selling and marketing monthly general and administrative average monthly operating costs overall in  metrocall experienced an reduction in average monthly operating expense per unit 
as discussed below  the company s operating results in included the operating expenses of page america and pronet for a full fiscal year 
in addition  the company s operating results include the operating expenses of amd from the october  acquisition date 
each operating expense is discussed separately below 
service  rent and maintenance expenses 
service  rent and maintenance expenses increased approximately million from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in metrocall s service  rent and maintenance expenses increased in because they included the service  rent and maintenance expenses of page america and pronet for a complete fiscal year million and the expenses of amd for the fourth quarter of million 
exclusive of the impact of the pronet merger and the page america and amd acquisitions  service  rent and maintenance expenses in remained relatively flat compared to expenses with increases in tower rents and network repairs and maintenance expenses being partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to the divesture of metrocall s telemessaging operations during for which no expenses were recognized in in  metrocall also continued to withhold payment and expense recognition of lec charges in its various service areas for any facilities used by those lecs to transport local calls to the company s local paging networks as provided under the act and the fcc s rules regarding local transport 
at december   metrocall had approximately million of credits receivable included in prepaid expenses and other current assets related to past charges assessed by the lecs for which the company is seeking reimbursement 
the increase in service  rent and maintenance expenses as a percentage of net revenues in was the result of the recent mergers and acquisitions 
average monthly service  rent and maintenance expense per unit slightly declined in as a result of the higher average subscriber base throughout as metrocall continues to expand its networks in order to serve more subscribers and offer advanced messaging capabilities  these expenses may increase 
selling and marketing expenses

the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues in was primarily from the impact of the company s recent merger and acquisitions and the related higher revenues base 
metrocall expects that selling and marketing expenses may increase as a percentage of revenues in the future as it expands its presence in existing and new markets 
average monthly selling and marketing expense per unit declined in as a result of the higher average subscriber base throughout general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in general and administrative expenses increased in because they included the general and administrative expenses of page america and pronet for a complete fiscal year million and the expenses of amd for the fourth quarter of million 
exclusive of the impact of the merger and acquisitions  general and administrative expenses increased for a variety of professional services million and additional operating personnel million 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues in was primarily from the benefit of economies of scale related to the company s recent merger and acquisitions and the related increase in the revenue base 
metrocall expects general and administrative expenses per unit to continue to decrease in as it gains additional synergies from the amd acquisition 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million from million in to million in the increase in total depreciation expense in was approximately million and resulted primarily from depreciation on additional subscriber paging equipment and other plant and equipment acquired mainly in the pronet merger and page america and amd acquisitions 
the increase in total amortization expense in was approximately million and resulted primarily from amortization expenses on intangibles acquired in metrocall s recent merger and acquisitions and the reduction in estimated useful lives of certain intangibles described below 
metrocall expects depreciation and amortization expenses in to increase as a result of a full year s impact of the amd acquisition 
effective january   the company reduced the estimated useful lives of certain intangibles  including goodwill  regulatory licenses issued by the fcc and subscriber bases recorded in conjunction with acquisitions from years to years for goodwill  from years to years for fcc licenses and from years for subscriber bases to years 
the impact of these changes was to increase amortization expense in by approximately million 
other increase interest and other income  net interest expense    income tax benefit    net loss    preferred dividends    ebitda    interest expense 
the increase in interest expense in of approximately million was the result of higher average debt balances outstanding during the fiscal year primarily associated with the additional debt assumed with the pronet merger and financing requirements of the amd acquisition 
during  total debt increased by million to million 
metrocall expects interest expense in to increase from due to expected higher average debt balances during income tax benefit 
the increase in the income tax benefit in of approximately million was the result of the tax benefit recorded on the amortization of non goodwill related intangible assets primarily generated from the pronet merger which occurred on december  for which no tax benefits were generated in and the amd acquisition which occurred on october  net loss 
metrocall s net loss increased approximately million from million in to million in the increase in net loss was primarily the result of increased depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses associated with the pronet merger and the page america and amd acquisitions offset by increases in net revenues related to an increase in the company s subscriber base as a result of internal growth and its recent merger and acquisitions 
preferred dividends 
the increase in preferred dividends in of approximately million was the result of higher dividends paid to the holders of the series a preferred and the series b preferred in and dividends paid in the fourth quarter of to the holder of the series c preferred 
dividends recognized on the series a preferred and the series b preferred increased by million and million  respectively due to their cumulative nature 
on october   metrocall issued  shares of the series c preferred in connection with the amd acquisition 
dividends recognized on the series c preferred were approximately million 
ebitda 
the increase in ebitda in of approximately million was primarily the result of the increase in revenues in offset to a lesser extent by the increase in operating expenses 
metrocall s ebitda margin improved from in to in year ended december  compared with december  the following table sets forth the amounts of revenues and the percentages of net revenues defined as total revenues less the net book value of products sold represented by certain items in metrocall s consolidated statements of operations and certain other information for fiscal years and of of revenues revenues revenues increase service  rent and maintenance    product sales    total revenues    net book value of products sold    net revenues    arpu number of subscribers    service  rent and maintenance revenues

during  metrocall s subscriber base grew by approximately million  which included approximately million subscribers acquired in the pronet merger 
monthly arpu for paging services increased by due to subscriber revenue mix acquired in the company s merger with a network in november  general service rate increases  the shift in the sales mix from primarily direct distribution channels  especially the direct sales force  to indirect channels and company owned retail stores  and the sale of enhanced paging services 
product sales revenues 
product sales revenues increased approximately million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in net book value of products sold increased approximately million from million in to million in principally because of the increase in product sales  partially offset by increased depreciation expense 
metrocall s gross margin on products sold increased from in to in the following tables set forth the amounts of operating expenses and related percentages of net revenues represented by certain items in metrocall s consolidated statements of operations and certain other information for fiscal years and of of operating expenses revenues revenues increase service  rent and maintenance    selling and marketing    general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    increase operating expenses per unit in service or decrease monthly service  rent and maintenance monthly selling and marketing monthly general and administrative average monthly operating expense overall in  metrocall experienced a increase in average monthly operating expense per unit 
as discussed below  the company s operating results in included the operating expenses of the acquisitions of parkway  satellite  and a network for a full fiscal year 
in addition  the operating results include the operating expenses of page america from the july  acquisition date 
service  rent and maintenance expenses 
service  rent and maintenance expenses increased approximately million from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in in  the overall increases in service  rent and maintenance expenses and as a percentage of revenues were attributable to the acquisitions of parkway million  satellite million  a network million and page america million completed during and additional increases were primarily due to increased site rental costs million and increased personnel costs million partially offset by reductions in third party carrier costs million 
in  the company ceased paying lecs in its various service areas for any facilities used by those lecs to transport local calls to metrocall s local paging networks as provided under the act and the fcc s rules regarding local transport  which had reduced third party carriers costs by approximately million 
the monthly service  rent and maintenance expense per unit increased by per unit as a result of the above items 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased approximately million from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of net revenues from in to in the increase in selling and marketing expenses and the increase as a percentage of net revenues were primarily associated with the and acquisitions  which added new sales offices and retail locations

traditional one way paging system equipment and operating costs have not increased and one way pager costs have declined significantly in recent years 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs are  however  subject to inflationary pressures 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources during the three years ended december   metrocall s operations have required significant funding  primarily to support mergers and acquisitions and capital expenditures for paging infrastructure and equipment requirements 
metrocall has met its funding requirements with cash generated from operating activities  borrowings under its credit facilities and proceeds from its senior subordinated notes offerings 
cash flows for  the company s cash provided by operating activities increased approximately million or from million in to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the effects of the pronet merger and the amd acquisition and related synergies  and the company s internal growth 
net cash used in investing activities in increased by million or from million in to million in during  the company borrowed million under its credit facility to fund the cash portion of the purchase price for the amd acquisition 
capital expenditures for included approximately million for pagers  representing increases in pagers on hand and net increases and maintenance to the rental subscriber base 
the balance of capital expenditures included million for information systems and computer related equipment  million for network construction and development and million for general purchases including leasehold improvements 
net cash used in financing activities in decreased by million or from million in to million in during  metrocall borrowed million under its credit facility and repaid approximately million 
of the borrowings under the facility  million was used for the cash portion of the purchase price for the amd acquisition and the remaining amount was used for general corporate purposes 
the repayments made under the facility included million using proceeds from the company s senior subordinated notes offering in as described below 
working capital working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was a deficit of million and million in and  respectively 
in  current assets increased by approximately million  primarily as a result of increases in trade receivables and other current assets acquired in the amd acquisition offset by lower cash balances 
current liabilities increased by approximately million as a result of higher deferred revenue due to a higher number of subscribers offset by lower other current liabilities 
long term debt at december  and  long term debt consisted of increase or long term debt decrease borrowings under the credit facility    senior subordinated notes    capital leases and other debt    total long term debt    borrowings and repayments under the credit facility 
during  metrocall reduced borrowings outstanding under its credit facility by approximately million 
repayments under the credit facility were funded primarily with proceeds from the company s senior subordinated notes offering in at the time of the notes offering  amounts outstanding under the credit facility approximated million  which had primarily included amounts outstanding at december  and additional borrowings of million used to fund the cash portion of the amd purchase price 
through march   metrocall borrowed under the credit facility an additional million of which million was used to fund the repurchase of the series b preferred and the remaining was used for general corporate purposes 
during  metrocall twice revised the terms of its credit facility to accommodate the amd acquisition and its notes offering 
on october   the company and its bank lenders increased the amount of borrowings available under the credit facility by million to million 
the additional million term loan facility was used to fund the cash portion of the amd acquisition 
on december   the company and its bank lenders reduced the amount of borrowings available under the credit facility by million to million in connection with the notes offering 
subject to certain conditions set forth in the company s revised credit facility agreement  metrocall may borrow up to million under two loan facilities through december  the first facility facility a is a million reducing revolving credit facility and the second facility b is a million reducing term credit 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of metrocall s assets 
required quarterly principal repayments  as defined  begin on march  and continue through december  under the revised credit facility  the company is required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants 
the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios  including total debt to annualized operating cash flow  senior debt to annualized operating cash flow  annualized operating cash flow to pro forma debt service  total sources of cash to total uses of cash  and operating cash flow to interest expense in each case  as such terms are defined in the credit facility agreement 
the covenants also limit additional indebtedness and future mergers and acquisitions without the approval of the lenders and restrict the payment of cash dividends and other stockholder distributions by metrocall 
the credit facility agreement also prohibits certain changes in ownership control of metrocall  as defined 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of these covenants 
proceeds raised from the issuance of senior subordinated notes 
in december  metrocall completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes bear interest  payable semi annually on march and september the notes may be redeemed at the company s option on or after september  the notes are unsecured obligations of the company  subordinated to all of its present and future senior indebtedness 
the company used the net proceeds from the notes of approximately million to repay outstanding indebtedness under its credit facility and for other corporate purposes 
the company is required to register the notes under the securities act by june  if this requirement is not met  the annual interest rate on the notes will increase by 
until the notes are generally freely transferable 
the notes contain various covenants that  among other restrictions  limit metrocall s ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  engage in certain other transactions with affiliates  sell assets and engage in mergers and consolidations except under certain conditions 
access to future capital metrocall s ability to access borrowings under the credit facility and to meet its debt service and other obligations including compliance with financial covenants will be dependent upon its future performance and its cash flows from operations  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond the company s control  such as prevailing economic conditions 
metrocall cannot assure you that  in the event the company was to require additional financing  such additional financing would be available on terms permitted by agreements relating to existing indebtedness or otherwise satisfactory to it 
metrocall believes that funds generated by its operations  together with those available under its credit facility  will be sufficient to finance estimated capital expenditure requirements and to fund its existing operations for the foreseeable future 
while there are no current outstanding commitments  the company may continue to evaluate strategic acquisition candidates in the future 
potential future acquisitions would be evaluated on significant strategic opportunities such as geographic coverage and regulatory licenses and other factors including overall valuation  consideration to be given and the availability of financing 
such potential acquisitions may result in substantial capital requirements for which additional financing may be required 
no assurance can be given that such additional financing would be available on terms satisfactory to metrocall 
metrocall s shares of common stock have traded on the nasdaq national market since metrocall s initial public offering in july the nasdaq national market listing maintenance standards require that  among other things  either metrocall maintain net tangible assets of million or metrocall s common stock maintain a minimum bid price of at least per share for consecutive trading days 
at december   metrocall met the net tangible asset requirement 
if in the future  the company fails to meet these standards  it could take a number of actions to maintain listing on a national exchange including  among others  a reverse stock split  stock repurchase program  or transfer of its listing to the nasdaq smallcap market 
year readiness disclosure the year issue consists of two primary shortcomings of many electronic data processing systems that may make them unable to process year date data accurately beyond the year first  computer programmers consistently abbreviated dates by eliminating the first two digits of the year  eg december  would become this shortcut may cause electronic data processing systems to recognize a date on january  as january  and process data inaccurately or stop processing altogether 
second  the algorithm used in some electronic data processing systems for calculating leap years is unable to detect that the year is a leap year 
therefore  systems that are not year compliant may not register the additional day  resulting in incorrect date calculations 
metrocall utilizes software and related computer technologies essential to its operations that may be affected by the year issue 
accordingly  the company has devised an enterprise wide program  consisting of the following phases  aimed to mitigate the year issue 
identification and assessment of potential problem areas 
by march   metrocall had inventoried a substantial portion of its computer hardware and software systems and the embedded systems contained in its plant and facilities and related infrastructure 
this process was undertaken with the goal of identifying the company s critical and non critical systems and assessing whether or not such systems are year compliant 
metrocall s critical systems include paging infrastructure  billing systems  telephone services  financial systems and operating systems and hardware 
for each of these systems  the company has developed or is in the process of developing a validation or remediation plan to address year concerns that have been identified 
remediation of identified problem areas 
during metrocall s identification and assessment phase  it had identified requirements for certain systems that it believes will enable these systems to become year compliant 
the remediation phase includes correcting identified problem areas 
this may include hardware and software revisions  developing replacement systems and eliminating non functional applications or system components 
metrocall is in various stages of remediation for its critical and non critical systems 
metrocall s goal is to complete the majority of its remediation efforts by september validation 
as metrocall makes changes to applications and components of its systems  it intends to validate and test those changes for year compliance 
the company plans to perform validation and testing on a system wide basis to ensure that any changes made are compatible with interacting systems 
the company may also conduct acceptance testing  where it deems it necessary 
metrocall is currently undertaking this phase on certain applications 
implementation 
this phase involves integrating the systems changes metrocall made in the remediation stage once they have been appropriately validated 
as metrocall implements and integrates such changes  it may still discover that its systems include both year compliant and non compliant applications and components 
metrocall does not expect this combination to have any significant adverse effect upon its operations but intends to develop appropriate contingency recovery plans to reduce the risk of such effects 
metrocall has begun this phase for certain systems applications and the company s goal is to achieve completion of the entire phase by the end of the fourth quarter third parties 
metrocall believes that many of its interconnect carriers  equipment suppliers and other primary vendors have year issues that may affect the company 
metrocall has sought and will continue to seek confirmation from these parties that they are developing and implementing plans to become year compliant 
metrocall intends to validate system processes that require interaction with vendor hardware or software in an effort to ensure system readiness by december  confirmations received to date have indicated that such respondents are in the process of implementing remediation plans in an effort to bring their systems into year compliance 
contingency plans 
the company is in the process of determining contingency plans for each of its systems if such systems are not year compliant 
the contingency plans will address likely worst case scenarios for each system included in the year program 
they will also consider  to the extent metrocall believes necessary  plans that address certain potential third party non compliance 
at this time  metrocall does not have sufficient information to assess the likelihood of such worst case scenarios but anticipates completion of such planning during the following briefly describes each of metrocall s critical systems and their year readiness 
paging infrastructure 
metrocall has an extensive paging infrastructure that provides services to its customers over a number of different frequencies 
the company has identified and performed certain year readiness assessment activities with regard to its paging software and hardware  and is working with its primary vendor that provides software to the company s paging infrastructure 
metrocall expects certain software upgrades to be installed by the end of the third quarter of  and those upgrades will be validated and tested shortly thereafter 
certain of the company s hardware units will require upgrade to support the required software 
such units will be upgraded at the same time the software upgrades are performed 
metrocall expects to incur approximately million during to support these paging infrastructure initiatives 
billing systems 
metrocall currently utilizes three different billing platforms that are used for the recordation and processing of customer invoices 
two of these platforms are commercial software applications 
the company has received vendor certification with respect to these platforms hardware  databases and the substantial majority of the software 
the third platform was developed by the former amd 
its year readiness was previously tested and warranted by amd s prior corporate owner 
metrocall has scheduled upgrades to certain operating systems to promote proper integration for the third and early fourth quarters once the upgrades have been completed  the company will move forward with its testing of the platforms and their interfaces to the paging and financial systems 
metrocall expects to incur approximately million during on these initiatives 
telephone services 
metrocall s ability to provide paging and messaging services is directly linked to its ability to accept and direct telephone traffic over an extended network 
in addition  the company s ability to sell products  administer customer calls and communicate between offices is dependent on its telephone network 
metrocall is currently in various phases of the remediation and validation stages for its internal telephone network 
metrocall s goal is to complete this phase by the end of the fourth quarter  with validation and implementation completed by december the company s cost for these initiatives in is expected to be approximately million 
metrocall is actively contacting its external telephone service providers to determine their level of year readiness 
financial systems 
metrocall s financial systems  which include its accounts payable  general ledger  fixed asset  purchase and inventory systems  have been vendor certified for year compliance 
the company is in process of testing the financial systems for functionality and data integrity between interfaces 
the company expects to have all testing completed by the end of the third quarter of metrocall does not expect to incur any significant costs related to year readiness for its financial systems 
operating systems and hardware 
metrocall has identified and performed year readiness assessment activities with regard to its network operating systems 
certain of such systems are scheduled for software upgrades that will improve their functionality and are year compliant 
the company anticipates completing these upgrades throughout with validation and implementation occurring shortly thereafter 
metrocall has identified personal computers that are not year compliant and which it intends to replace by december  the company expects the cost of these initiatives to be approximately million 
metrocall is utilizing both internal and external resources to remediate and test its systems for year compliance 
the company is incurring internal labor as well as consulting and other expenses related to infrastructure and facilities enhancements necessary to prepare its systems 
although it is metrocall s goal that its systems be year compliant on or before december   there can be no assurance that the company s year program will be successful or that its interconnect carriers and primary vendors will also successfully address their year issues 
metrocall is unable to predict the potential impact on its financial condition and results of operations in the event its year program is not successful 
additional factors affecting future operating results and financial condition as the company has described in this annual report on form k  metrocall believes that its future operating results and funds generated from operations and available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet general corporate requirements and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  metrocall s ability to meet its debt service and other obligations is dependent upon such future performance  which will be subject to factors beyond its control 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones metrocall faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  metrocall s business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
metrocall has a history of operating losses 
metrocall has sustained net losses of million  million and million for fiscal years  and those losses are significantly attributable to its consolidation and growth strategies and capital expenditure requirements 
metrocall cannot assure you that it can reverse such losses in the future 
in addition  at december   metrocall s accumulated deficit was approximately million and its working capital deficit was million 
the company s business requires substantial funds for capital expenditures and acquisitions  both of which cause significant depreciation and amortization expenses 
additionally  metrocall has substantial levels of borrowing  which results in significant interest expense  expected to be outstanding in the foreseeable future 
metrocall therefore expects to continue to incur losses from operations 
metrocall cannot assure you that it will achieve profitability in the future 
metrocall s substantial indebtedness may have operating consequences 
metrocall had total debt outstanding of approximately million at december  this substantial indebtedness  along with the net operating losses and working capital deficits it has sustained in recent periods  may have consequences for the company 
for example  it may make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its debt  require metrocall to dedicate a substantial portion of its operating cash flows from operations to pay interest expense  limit its ability to react to changing market conditions  changes in its industry and economic downturns  place metrocall at a competitive disadvantage with respect to its ability to finance future acquisitions or capital expenditures compared to its competitors that have less debt  limit its ability to borrow additional funds  and cause the company to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates because a substantial amount of its indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at floating rates 
total debt at december  included million outstanding under metrocall s credit facility which was subject to variable interest rate risk 
to the extent that interest rates fluctuate  the interest expense metrocall recognizes on borrowings outstanding on its credit facility could fluctuate 
a rate change in the company s weighted average interest rate in would have caused interest expense to increase or decrease by approximately million based on its weighted average borrowings outstanding during the year 
metrocall s debt agreements impose operating and financial restrictions 
metrocall s debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions 
such restrictions will affect  and in many respects  significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  metrocall s ability to incur additional indebtedness and certain types of indebtedness  pay cash dividends  repurchase or redeem its capital stock  make certain investments or other restricted payments  create liens  engage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates  sell assets  issue or sell stock of subsidiaries  merge or consolidate with other companies 
metrocall s credit facility requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
the terms of the company s preferred stock also contain certain restrictive covenants 
events beyond metrocall s control could affect its ability to meet these financial ratio tests and restrictive covenants  and metrocall cannot assure you that it will meet them 
if metrocall does not comply with these restrictions  it could lead to default even if the company can currently pay its scheduled debt obligations 
if there was a default  the holders could demand immediate payment of the debt 
this could cause much of metrocall s other debt to be accelerated 
metrocall cannot assure you that it would be able to pay or refinance this debt on acceptable terms in that event 
a breach of any of the covenants contained in its credit facility result in an event of default 
this could allow metrocallis lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  the company s lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility are accelerated  metrocall cannot assure you that its assets will be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the banks or to its other debt holders 
most of metrocall s assets are classified as intangible 
at december   metrocall s total assets were approximately  million including net intangible assets of approximately million 
a majority of metrocall s assets consist of fcc licenses and certificates  goodwill  subscriber lists  deferred financing costs and certain other intangibles 
the carrying value of these assets could be impaired in the future due to changes in technology  regulation  available financing or competitive pressures in any of the company s individual markets 
because a majority of the company s assets are intangible  they might not be sufficient to repay all of metrocall s debt if secured creditors foreclose on assets pledged to them 
technological developments could affect metrocall s business 
future technological advances in the wireless communications industry could create new services or products that compete with metrocall s paging and wireless messaging services 
developments in narrowband pcs could affect metrocall s business 
narrowband pcs provides enhanced or advanced paging and messaging capabilities  such as confirmation or response paging 
the company intends to participate actively in this business through its alliance with pagemart 
advanced messaging services marketed by other companies have  to date  had mixed market acceptance 
the success of advanced messaging services could be affected by circumstances other than market acceptance 
these include cost of equipment and other capital requirements  technological changes in wireless messaging services  competitors marketing and sales strategies  regulatory developments and general economic conditions 
additionally  several of the company s largest competitors in the traditional paging market have narrowband pcs licenses that provide them nationwide coverage 
some of those competitors have had a significant lead on metrocall in the deployment of narrowband pcs systems 
metrocall s business may also be affected by the development of broadband pcs  which offers two way voice communications and messaging services 
broadband pcs competes with cellular telephone services and enhanced specialized mobile radio services  as well as with conventional paging services 
these broadband services are now offering alphanumeric paging and voice mail included in their handset and monthly fee 
several broadband pcs systems currently operate in the united states 
additionally  other existing or prospective radio services such as non geostationary mobile satellite services potentially could compete with the company 
these broadband services could adversely impact the demand for our paging and advanced messaging services 
changes in technology could lower the cost of competing services and products to a level at which the company s services and products would become less competitive or at which the company would be required to reduce its prices 
metrocall cannot assure you that it will be able to develop or introduce new services and products on a timely basis and at competitive prices  if at all  nor can the company assure you that its margins  inventory costs and cash flows will not be adversely affected by technological developments 
technological changes also may affect the value of pagers that metrocall owns and leases to its subscribers 
if the company s subscribers request more technologically advanced pagers  metrocall may incur additional inventory costs and capital expenditures if it is required to replace pagers leased to its subscribers within a short period of time 
metrocall could be affected by satellite failures 
metrocall relies on satellite facilities operated by other companies to control many of the transmitters on our nationwide and wide area networks 
metrocall has no control over the operation and maintenance of those satellite facilities 
the company also uses land based communications facilities such as microwave stations and landline telephone facilities to connect and control the paging base station transmitters in its networks 
the failure or disruption of transmissions by these satellite facilities could disrupt the company s paging services 
metrocall recently initiated paging service through a satellite global uplink facility in california 
the company transmits a majority of its paging traffic through this facility 
any unmitigated interruptions in satellite transmissions or in transmissions from the satellite uplink facility could adversely affect metrocall s business and results of operations 
subscriber turnover can adversely affect metrocall s results of operations 
the results of operations of paging service providers can be significantly affected when subscribers cancel their service or switch their service to other carriers 
the sales and marketing costs associated with attracting new subscribers are much higher than the costs of providing service to existing customers 
because metrocall s business has high fixed costs  disconnections directly and adversely affect its results of operations 
metrocall s business could be affected by changes in regulations 
the fcc and  to a lesser extent  various state regulatory agencies regulate metrocall s paging operations 
the company cannot assure you that those agencies will not take actions that would have a material adverse effect on metrocall s business 
changes in regulation of paging businesses or the allocation of radio spectrum for services that compete with the company s business could adversely affect its results of operations 
for example  the fcc has adopted rules under which the fcc will issue paging licenses on a wide area basis through competitive bidding 
although the company believes that these rules may simplify its regulatory compliance burdens  particularly regarding adding or relocating transmitter sites  those rule changes may increase metrocall s costs of obtaining paging licenses in the future 
additional acquisitions will require successful integration and may pose other risks 
metrocall has achieved much of its growth through acquisitions 
it may pursue more acquisitions in the future 
metrocall s success will then depend upon its ability to identify attractive candidates  to finance potential acquisitions and to integrate their business 
the challenges of acquisitions include potential strain on management  unanticipated liabilities or contingencies from the acquired company  reduced earnings due to increased goodwill amortization  increased interest costs  and costs related to integration  integrating the acquired business s financial  personnel  computer and other systems into its own  and need to manage growth and implement controls and information systems appropriate to a growing company 
if metrocall is unsuccessful in meeting these challenges  its business could be adversely affected 
the company is currently in the process of integrating the recent acquisition of amd 
that acquisition poses certain risks for metrocall s business  eg  the paging systems it acquired may not perform as expected  it may face difficulties integrating the development  administrative  finance  sales and marketing organizations of amd into its organizations  the company may face difficulties in integrating amd s communications networks with its own networks and coordinating its and amd s sales efforts 
metrocall must reassure amd s customers that their paging services will continue uninterrupted 
metrocall relies on key management personnel 
metrocall depends on the efforts and abilities of a number of its current key management  sales  support and technical personnel  including william l 
collins iii  steven d 
jacoby and vincent d 
kelly 
metrocall s success will depend to a large extent on its ability to retain and attract key employees 
the loss of certain of these employees or the company s inability to retain or attract key employees in the future could have an adverse effect on its operations 
the company has employment contracts with  but does not have key man life insurance for  each of the individuals named above
