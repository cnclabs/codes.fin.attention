item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview since the company s inception  substantially all of the company s revenue has been generated by its ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise service solutions business 
contracts for these ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise service solutions have been in virtually all cases fixed price contracts 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
in addition to possible errors or omission in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering design and testing 
since the company s business may at certain times be concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the period from contract award through installation of ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise service solutions supplied by the company generally requires from three to months 
the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting for contract revenues  upon the achievement of certain milestones 
accordingly  most of the revenue from sales of products is typically recognized when the product is shipped  with the balance recognized at the time of acceptance by the customer 
revenues from providing satellite delivered data communications services are recognized at the time the service is performed 
costs of revenues are generally recorded based on the relationship of the amount of projected final costs to the percentage of revenue recorded for the specific contract 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
costs of revenues consist primarily of the costs of purchased material  direct labor and related overhead expenses  project related travel  living costs and subcontractor salaries 
in addition  cost of revenues relating to internet access service fees consists primarily of satellite space segment charges and internet connectivity fees 
network operations expenses consist primarily of cost associated with the operation of netsat express network operations center on a twenty four hour a day  seven day a week basis including costs of personnel and teleport service costs 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and travel and living costs for sales and marketing personnel 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses paid to engineers 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with the company s management  accounting  contract and administrative functions 
the company anticipates that network operations  selling and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase during the next several years due to expected increases in personnel and expenses related to supporting the company s expanding customer base

revenues  which were primarily derived from sales of ground segment systems and networks  decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease relates primarily to the decrease in the shipment and or completion of ground segment systems and networks contracts as a result of a decline in the bookings of contract orders due to the continuing difficult economic conditions in the pacific rim  russia and other international markets 
the company expects the trend in revenues that adversely affected its results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  to continue to adversely impact the company 
these trends include the difficult economic conditions in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets and the decrease in bookings received by the company from these regions 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the shipment and or completion of ground segment systems and networks contracts 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to a significant negotiated contract in the second and third quarters of fiscal  which resulted in a higher gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended june   as well as  pricing pressures in the marketplace 
network operations

general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june   and increased as a percentage of revenues to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted mainly from an increase in personnel and related expenses 
terminated acquisition costs 
terminated acquisition costs of approximately million for fiscal year ended june   relate to certain legal  accounting and other expenses associated with the termination of a proposed acquisition of a mobile satellite communications business during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended june  due to the determination that such acquisition was not in the best interest of the company s stockholders 
write down of investments 
write down of investments of approximately million for fiscal year ended june   related to two investments which were written down in the fourth quarter ended june  the company s management s evaluated the investments and believed it would be appropriate to write down the investments to zero 
interest income net of interest expense 
interest income decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to the reduction of cash and cash equivalents from june  to june  netsat express 
the company s consolidated subsidiary  netsat express  experienced an increase in revenues of million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase resulted from the implementation of access plus services in january  as well as an increase in the equipment sales and activations 
the loss from operations associated with netsat express increased by million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily associated with an increase in general and administrative expenses relating to an increase in personnel to support the overall growth of netsat express and the implementation of operating netsat express network operations center on a twenty four hour a day  seven day a week basis during the year 
fiscal years ended june  and revenues 
revenues  which were primarily derived from sales of ground segment systems and networks and enterprise service solutions  increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily the result of a negotiated contract with sonangol  uee as well as an overall increase in the number of shipments and or completion of contracts as the company continued to expand its businesses 
revenues for the three month period ended june  decreased by to million from million for the same period in the previous year as a result of the decline in bookings in previous quarters as a result of the economic conditions in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets 
the company expects the trend in revenues that adversely affected its results of operations for the three month period ended june  to continue to impact the company 
these trends include the difficult economic conditions in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets and the decrease in bookings received by the company from these regions 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the increase in the shipment of ground segment systems and networks  and enterprise service solutions 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues were for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was due primarily to a significant negotiated contract with sonangol  uee  which resulted in higher gross profit margin offset in part by an increase in orders awarded through a competitive bidding process  which typically result in lower gross profit margins than negotiated contracts 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of bids and proposals prepared by the company  as well as an increase in marketing personnel from at june  to at june  selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  due to an increase in development costs associated with custom solutions 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june   but decreased as a percentage of revenues to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million in legal and other costs associated with operating a public company  and an increase of approximately million in personnel and related expenses to support the continued growth of the company s business 
interest income net of interest expense 
interest income increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily the result of the investment of remaining net proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
netsat express 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company s consolidated subsidiary netsat express experienced an increase in revenues of approximately million to approximately million from approximately million for the year ended june  the increase resulted from the implementation of access plus services in january  an increase in the number of pc vector equipment sales and related activations 
the increase in loss from operations associated with netsat express of approximately million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the year ended june  was mainly attributable to initial start up costs associated with providing access plus and pc vector services 
year the company is in the process of assessing the anticipated costs  problems and uncertainties associated with year issues 
the company has initiated a year compliance plan which includes information technology it and non it systems requiring or which may require modification or conversion  and supplier  facilities and other operations such as financial and banking systems readiness 
the company has substantially completed reviews of each of the above areas including identification and assessment of potential year issues  identification and contact with key suppliers or institutions based on their relative risks associated with product integrity and continued product deliveries and service 
until such reviews are complete  the company will not be able to completely evaluate whether its it and non it systems will need to be modified or replaced 
the company has incurred only nominal costs to date and estimates at this time that the total year costs will not be material 
the company is continuing its assessment which may necessitate refinement of its estimate over time 
there can be no assurance  however  that costs associated with the company s year compliance plan will not be higher than anticipated which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in association with the company s year compliance plan  the company has developed contingency plans for certain critical applications 
these contingency plans may include  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing inventories and adjusting staffing strategies 
there can be no assurance such contingency plans  once developed  will be adequate 
since the company s year compliance plan is ongoing  all potential year issues have not yet been identified 
therefore the potential impact of these issues on the company s financial condition and results of operations can not be determined at this time 
if it and non it systems used by the company or its suppliers  the product integrity of products provided to the company by its suppliers  or the software applications or hardware used in systems integrated and sold by the company  fail or experience significant difficulties related to the year  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that equipment operated by third parties that interface with or contain the company s products will timely achieve year compliance 
furthermore  if the company s ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise service solutions and satellite delivered data communication services were unable to be used by the company s customers because of year compliance problems  there can be no assurance that the company s customers will not commence litigation against the company for such systems and networks failure 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
quarterly results the following tables set forth certain unaudited financial information for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the period ended june  the company believes that this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the annual report on form k and in the opinion of management all necessary adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results of operations when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of the company and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period

general and administrative terminated acquisition costs write down of investments total operating expenses loss income from operations interest income  net net loss income the company may continue to experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its results of operations  which may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of the initiation and completion of contracts  delays in the booking of new contracts  the demand for the company s products and services  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products and services  the mix of revenues between custom built satellite communications systems and networks designed for its customers and standard installations provided to its customers  the growth of demand for internet infrastructure based products and services in developing countries  the timing of significant marketing programs  the extent and timing of the hiring of additional personnel  competitive conditions in the industry and general economic conditions in the us and abroad  such as the difficult economic conditions and currency devaluations in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets which have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact the company s quarterly results 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in one or more future quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted cash of million  accounts receivable of million  inventories of million and prepaid and other current assets of million  offset by million in accounts payable and million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
the company has experienced negative cash flow from operations since its inception 
net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal years ended june    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
several factors had a major effect on the company s liquidity during the fiscal year ended june  first  the company had a million negative cash flow from operations  which primarily relates to the net loss of million and increase in inventory of million reflecting the timing of purchases to support future shipments and or completion of ground segment systems and networks  offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the second factor affecting liquidity during the fiscal year ended june  was the company s investment activities 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company purchased million in fixed assets and through its stock repurchase program  repurchased million or  shares of the company s common stock 
in addition  during the first quarter ended september   the company purchased a million equity interest in mckibben communications  llc 
the company has incurred losses since its inception and  therefore  has not been subject to federal income taxes 
through june   the company  for income tax purposes  has generated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which may be available to reduce future taxable income and future tax liabilities 
these carryforwards expire through the tax reform act of provides for an annual limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards following certain ownership changes that could significantly limit the company s ability to utilize these carryforwards 
the exercise of options or warrants or in connection with future sales of equity could limit the company s ability to utilize the aforementioned carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities 
additionally  because the united states tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  the company may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
the company has a million credit facility consisting of a million secured domestic line of credit and a million secured export import guaranteed line of credit 
each line of credit bears interest at the prime rate as of june  plus per annum and is collateralized by a first security interest on all the company s assets 
in august  netsat express completed a private placement of common stock yielding gross proceeds of million 
these proceeds are to be used to fund netsat express operations and expand marketing initiatives as well as expected engineering and facilities growth over the coming year 
management anticipates that netsat express will experience negative cash flow as a result of these additional capital investments required for continued development of its operations and losses from operations for at least the next months 
the company expects that its cash and working capital requirements for its operating activities will continue to increase as the company expands its operations 
the company s future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the success of the company s marketing efforts in the ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise service solutions business  and the satellite delivered data communications services business  the nature and timing of customer orders  the extent to which it is able to locate additional strategic suppliers in whose technology it wishes to invest  the extent to which it must conduct research and development efforts internally and potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
based on current plans  the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements through june  however  no assurance can be given that there will be no change that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
additional funds may not be available when needed and even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of existing stockholders of the company 
if adequate funds are not available  the company will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of its operating activities  including without limitation  the timing and extent of its marketing programs  the extent and timing of hiring additional personnel and its research and development activities 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
risk factors history of net losses and accumulated deficit the company has incurred significant net losses since its inception 
the company has financed its operations to date primarily from the sale of equity securities and  to a lesser degree  from stockholder loans 
the company generated its first revenue from its ground segment systems  and networks business in june and has generated only minimal revenues from its satellite delivered data communications services business  which commenced operations in july the company has incurred net losses since inception and has incurred net losses of million  million and million during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively which amounts for fiscal years ended june   and include net losses of million  million and million  respectively for netsat express satellite delivered data communication services business and will incur further losses as it attempts to expand its businesses 
the company s ability to expand its ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise service solutions business and satellite delivered data communication services business and generate additional revenues and positive operating and net income is dependent  in large part  on its ability to obtain new contracts and the profitability of such contracts  and there can be no assurance that the company will generate significant additional revenues or report quarterly or annual positive operating or net income 
as of june   the company had an accumulated deficit of million

inherent risk of international operations for the fiscal year ended june   of the company s revenues are derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
the company anticipates that foreign sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues in the foreseeable future 
the company s foreign sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
consequently  the decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  such as the currency devaluations in the pacific rim region  russia and other international currencies  has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the demand for the company s ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions business and satellite delivered data communication services business by increasing the price of the company s products and services in the currency of the countries in which they are sold 
the economic and monetary crisis in the pacific rim countries  including korea  malaysia  thailand  philippines  indonesia and other countries in the region  as well as the economic and monetary declines in russia  has resulted in a decreased demand in such countries and other foreign regions for capital equipment such as the ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions supplied by the company and netsat express satellite delivered data communications services 
the difficult economic conditions in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets and the decrease in bookings received by the company from these and other foreign regions have adversely effected the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  and the company expects that these negative trends will continue to adversely impact it 
additional risks inherent to the company s international business activities include various and changing regulatory requirements  costs and risks of relying upon local subcontractors for the installation of its ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions  increased sales and marketing expenses  availability of export licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially adverse taxes  complex foreign laws and treaties and the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable collections 
in addition  the company is subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa which may place the company at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies  which are not subject to the fcpa 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
quarterly fluctuations the company may continue to experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in its results of operations  which may result in volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of the initiation and completion of contracts  delays in the booking of new contracts  the demand for the company s ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions and netsat express satellite delivered data communications  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by the company or netsat express or their competitors  market acceptance of new products and services  the mix of revenues between custom built satellite communications systems and networks designed for its customers and standard installations provided to its customers  the growth of demand for internet infrastructure based products and services in developing countries  the timing of significant marketing programs  the extent and timing of the hiring of additional personnel  competitive conditions in the industry and general economic conditions in the us and abroad  such as the difficult economic conditions and currency devaluations in the pacific rim region  russia and other international markets which have adversely impacted  and may continue to  adversely impact the company s quarterly results 
see inherent risk of international operations 
due to the foregoing factors  it is likely that in one or more future quarters the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
intense competition  limited barriers to entry the markets for both ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions business and satellite delivered data communication services business are highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors have greater market presence  engineering and marketing capabilities  and financial  technological and personnel resources than those available to the company 
as a result  such competitors may be able to develop and expand their products and services more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily  and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than can the company 
in addition  there are limited barriers to entry in the company s markets and certain of the company s strategic suppliers and customers have technologies and capabilities in the company s product areas and could choose to compete with the company or to replace the company s products or services with their own 
the entry of new competitors  the decision by a strategic ally to compete with the company or the decision by a customer to develop and employ in house capability to satisfy its satellite communications needs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company anticipates that its competitors may develop or acquire competing products or products that provide functionality that is similar to that provided by the company s products and may be offered at significantly lower prices or bundled with other products 
in addition  current and potential competitors in both markets in which the company competes have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products and services to address the needs of the company s current and prospective customers 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross profit margins and loss of market share  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company also is dependent on the continued success and development of the satellite communications industry  which itself competes with other technologies such as terrestrial microwave  copper wire and fiber optic communications systems 
any failure of the satellite communications industry to continue to develop  or any technological development which significantly improves the capacity  cost or efficiency of such competing systems relative to satellite systems  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see rapid industry change  technological obsolescence 
additional financing requirements  uncertainty of additional funding the company has incurred negative cash flows from operations in each year since its inception 
the company expects that its cash and working capital requirements for its operating activities will continue to increase as the company expands its operations 
the company anticipates that its capital resources are adequate to satisfy its capital requirements through june  at its current level of operations 
however  no assurance can be given that there will be no change that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
additional funds may not be available when needed and even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of existing stockholders of the company 
if adequate funds are not available  the company will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of its operating activities  including without limitation  the timing and extent of its marketing programs  the extent and timing of hiring additional personnel and its research and development activities 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms  or at all 
reliance on strategic relationships the company is dependent on certain customers and suppliers for the development and expansion of its ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions business and satellite delivered data communication services business 
however  such relationships are not governed by any contract and  accordingly  neither the company nor such customers or suppliers are obligated to maintain such strategic relationships 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such strategic relationships  that its strategic customers and suppliers will continue to assist the company by developing and expanding its business and by providing research and development expertise  or that such strategic customers and suppliers will not actually compete with the company in the future 
see intense competition  limited barriers to entry 
because the company intends to provide its satellite delivered data communications services almost entirely in developing markets where the company has little or no market experience  the company will also be dependent on local partners in such markets to provide marketing expertise and knowledge of the local regulatory environment in order to facilitate the acquisition of necessary licenses and access to existing customers 
the company has not yet formally established an alliance with a local partner 
the company s failure to form and maintain such alliances with local partners  or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by the actions of the company s competitors or otherwise  would adversely affect the company s ability to penetrate and compete successfully in such emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future in such markets or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of customer concentration the company typically relies upon a small number of customers for a large portion of its revenues 
for example  approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal were derived from sales to three customers 
at june   million  or approximately of the company s backlog was accounted for by a contract between the company and transworld communications services  inc the company expects that in the near term a significant portion of its revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers the identity of whom may vary from period to period as the company seeks to expand its business and its customer base 
the reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from one or more of such significant customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of management of rapid growth the company has been significantly and rapidly expanding its operations since its inception 
in order to pursue successfully the opportunities presented by the ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions business and satellite delivered data communication services business  the company will be required to continue to expand its operations 
such expansion has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s personnel  management  and financial and other resources 
in order to manage any future growth effectively  the company will  among other things  be required to attract  train  motivate and manage a significantly larger number of employees successfully to conduct product engineering and management  product implementation  sales activity and customer support activities  manage higher working capital requirements  and improve its operating and financial systems 
any failure to manage any future growth in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with the company s business could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk of fixed price contracts virtually all of the company s contracts for installation of ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions are on a fixed price basis 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
in addition to possible errors or omissions in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles  including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering  design and testing 
since the company s business may at certain times be concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any one contract could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk of customer concentration 
emphasis on developing markets  uncertain market potential the company believes a substantial portion of the growth in demand for its ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions business and satellite delivered data communication services business will come from customers in developing countries 
there can be no assurance that such increases in demand will occur or that prospective customers will accept such products and services in sufficient quantities or at all 
the degree to which the company is able to penetrate potential markets in developing countries will be affected in major part by the speed with which other competing elements of the communications infrastructure  such as telephone lines  other satellite delivered solutions and fiber optic cable and television cable  are installed in the developing countries and with respect to the company s satellite delivered data communication services business  also on the effectiveness of the company s local partners in such markets 
the failure to have its products and services accepted in developing countries would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see intense competition  limited barriers to entry and reliance on strategic relationships 
rapid industry change  technological obsolescence the telecommunications industry  including the ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions business and satellite delivered data communication services business  is characterized by rapid and continuous technological change 
future technological advances in the telecommunications industry may result in the availability of new products or services that could compete with the satellite ground segment products and services and satellite delivered data communications services provided by the company or render the company s products and services obsolete 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and introducing new products and services that meet changing customer needs or in responding to technological changes or evolving industry standards in a timely manner  if at all  or that services or technologies developed by others will not render the company s products or services noncompetitive 
any failure by the company to respond to changing market conditions  technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements  or the development of competing technology or products that render the company s products and services noncompetitive or obsolete would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the data code field 
these data code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates 
as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year requirements 
significant uncertainty exists in the software industry concerning the potential effects associated with such compliance 
the company is in the process of assessing the anticipated costs  problems and uncertainties associated with year issues 
the company has initiated a year compliance plan which includes information technology it and non it systems requiring or which may require modification or conversion  and supplier  facilities and other operations such as financial and banking systems readiness 
the company has substantially completed reviews of each of the above areas including identification and assessment of potential year issues  identification and contact with key suppliers or institutions based on their relative risks associated with product integrity and continued product deliveries and service 
until such reviews are complete  the company will not be able to completely evaluate whether its it and non it systems will need to be modified or replaced 
the company has incurred only nominal costs to date and estimates at this time that the total year costs will not be material 
the company is continuing its assessment which may necessitate refinement of its estimate over time 
there can be no assurance  however  that costs associated with the company s year compliance plan will not be higher than anticipated which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in association with the company s year compliance plan  the company is currently developing contingency plans for certain critical applications 
these contingency plans may include  among other actions  manual workarounds  increasing inventories and adjusting staffing strategies 
there can be no assurance such contingency plans  once developed  will be adequate 
since the company s year compliance plan is ongoing  all potential year issues have not yet been identified 
therefore the potential impact of these issues on the company s financial condition and results of operations can not be determined at this time 
if it and non it systems used by the company or its suppliers  the product integrity of products provided to the company by its suppliers  or the software applications or hardware used in systems integrated and sold by the company  fail or experience significant difficulties related to the year  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected 
in addition  there can be no assurance that equipment operated by third parties that interface with or contain the company s products will timely achieve year compliance 
furthermore  if the company s ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions and satellite delivered data communication services were unable to be used by the company s customers because of year compliance problems  there can be no assurance that the company s customers will not commence litigation against the company for such systems and networks failure 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence upon suppliers  sole and limited sources of supply the company currently procures most of the critical components and services for its products from single or limited sources in connection with specific contracts and does not otherwise carry significant inventories or have long term or exclusive supply contracts with its source vendors 
the company has from time to time experienced delays in receiving products from certain of its vendors due to quality control or manufacturing problems  shortages of materials or components or product design difficulties 
there can be no assurance that similar problems will not recur or that replacement products will be available when needed at commercially reasonable rates  or at all 
if the company were to change certain of its vendors  the company would be required to perform additional testing procedures upon the components supplied by such new vendors  which could prevent or delay product shipments 
additionally  prices could increase significantly in connection with changes of vendors 
any inability of the company to obtain timely deliveries of materials of acceptable quality or timely services  or any significant increase in the prices of materials or services  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

risk of failure to comply with government regulations the company is subject to various federal laws and regulations  which may have negative effects on the company 
the company operates earth stations in hauppauge  new york  subject to fcc rules and regulations 
the company has obtained certain licenses from the fcc for both domestic and international operation of its earth stations and must operate it in compliance with fcc rules and regulations for the terms of the licenses 
these licenses generally should be renewed by the fcc so long as the company is in compliance with the fcc rules and regulations 
the company cannot offer assurances that any necessary additional licenses will be granted by the fcc 
generally  non us citizens or their representatives  foreign governments  or corporations otherwise subject to control by non us citizens may not directly own more than of a licensee or may not indirectly own more than of a licensee  through a parent corporation or other controlling entity  under the fcc rules and regulations 
the fcc may grant waivers of its foreign ownership policy to allow for increased indirect investment in a licensee by an entity based in a world trade organization wto member country 
for an entity based in a non wto member country  the fcc will allow increased indirect investment only if a licensee can show that the non wto member country allows effective competitive opportunities for us based entities 
failure to comply with these policies may result in an order to divest the offending alien ownership  fines  denial of license renewal  and or license revocation proceedings against the licensee by the fcc 
the company has no knowledge of any present foreign ownership which would result in a violation of the fcc rules and regulations 
the company may  in the future  be required to seek a waiver of the fcc rules and regulations regarding foreign ownership  if such ownership exceeds the aforementioned benchmarks 
regulatory schemes in countries in which the company may seek to provide its satellite delivered data communications services may impose impediments on the company s operations 
certain countries in which the company intends to operate have telecommunications laws and regulations that do not currently contemplate technical advances in broadcast technology such as internet intranet transmission by satellite 
there can be no assurance that the present regulatory environment in any such country will not be changed in a manner  which may have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
the company or its local partners typically must obtain authorization for each country in which the company provides its satellite delivered data communications services 
although the company believes that it or its local partners will be able to obtain the requisite licenses and approvals from the countries in which the company intends to provide service  the regulatory schemes in each country are different and thus there may be instances of noncompliance of which the company is not aware 
although the company believes these regulatory schemes will not prevent the company from pursuing its business plan  there can be no assurance such licenses and approvals are or will remain sufficient in the view of foreign regulatory authorities  or that necessary licenses and approvals will be granted on a timely basis in all jurisdictions in which the company wishes to offer its services or that restrictions applicable thereto will not be unduly burdensome 
the company s internet operations other than the operation of a teleport are not currently subject to direct government regulation in most countries  and there are currently few laws or regulations directly applicable to access to or commerce on the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  it is likely that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted at the local  national or international levels with respect to the internet  covering issues such as user privacy and expression  pricing of products and services  taxation  advertising  intellectual property rights  information security or the convergence of traditional communication services with internet communications 
for example  the child online protection act  enacted in the united states in  imposes civil and criminal penalties on internet content providers who fail to restrict minor s access to material that is deemed harmful to them 
however  this act is currently enjoined and its constitutionality is being adjudicated 
it is anticipated that a substantial portion of the company s internet operations will be carried out in countries which may impose greater regulation of the content of information coming into the country than that which is generally applicable in the united states 
to the extent that the company provides content as a part of its internet services  it will be subject to any such laws regulating content 
moreover  the adoption of any such laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for the company s internet services or increase the company s cost of doing business or in some other manner have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel and personal privacy is uncertain 
the vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and  as a result  do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to such laws intended to address these issues  including some recently proposed changes  could create uncertainty in the marketplace which could reduce demand for the company s services  could increase the company s cost of doing business as a result of costs of litigation or increased product development costs  or could in some other manner have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the sale of the company s ground segment systems  and networks  and enterprise network service solutions outside the united states is subject to compliance with the regulations of the united states export administration regulations 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect the company s competitive position 
in addition  in order to ship the company s products into certain other countries  the products must satisfy the technical requirements of that particular country 
if the company were unable to comply with such requirements with respect to a significant quantity of the company s products  the company s sales in europe could be restricted  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on key personnel the company s future success depends to a significant extent on its executive officers and certain technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals or group of individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company maintains term life insurance in the amount of million on david e 
hershberg  the chairman and chief executive officer of the company and term life insurance in the amount of million for each of messrs 
miller  woodring  yablonski and melfi  all of whom are officers of the company 
the company believes that its future success also will depend significantly upon its ability to attract  motivate and retain additional highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining the personnel it requires to grow and operate profitably 
proprietary technology  risk of infringement the company relies heavily on the technological and creative skills of its personnel  new product developments  computer programs and designs  frequent product enhancements  reliable product support and proprietary technological expertise in maintaining its competitive position  and lacks patent protection for its products and services 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop or acquire substantially equivalent techniques or otherwise gain access to the company s proprietary and confidential technological expertise or disclose such technologies or that the company can ultimately protect its rights to such proprietary technological expertise 
the company generally relies on confidentiality agreements with its consultants  key employees and sales representatives to protect its proprietary technological expertise  and generally controls access to and distribution of its technology  software and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  there can be no assurance that such agreements will not be breached  that the company will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that a third party will not copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products or technology without authorization or develop similar products or technology independently 
failure by the company to maintain protection of its proprietary technological expertise for any reason could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to the risk of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of others 
most of the company s officers and employees were formerly officers or employees of other companies in the industry 
the company believes that neither it nor its officers or employees have violated any agreements with  or obligations to  prior employers 
although the company is not aware of any pending or threatened infringement claims with respect to the company s current or future products  there can be no assurance that third parties  including previous employers  will not assert such claims or that any such claims will not require the company to enter into license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation  regardless of the merits of such claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  such licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect the company s intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company currently has two patents in the united states  a patent pending in the united states and a pct application  corresponding to one of the united states patents  is pending in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
the company also intends to seek further patents on its technology  if appropriate 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of the company s pending or any future applications or that any claims allowed from such applications will be of sufficient scope or strength  or be issued in all countries where the company s products can be sold  to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
also  competitors of the company may be able to design around the company s patents 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold may not protect the company s products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and thus make the possibility of piracy of the company s technology and products more likely 
the company has filed applications for trademark registration of globecomm systems inc in the united states and various other countries  has received a trademark for netsat express in the united states  and has filed applications for trademark registration of netsat express in various other countries 
the company intends to seek registration of other trademarks in the future 
there can be no assurance that registrations will be granted from any of the company s pending or future applications  or that any registrations that are granted to the company will prevent others from using similar trademarks in connection with related goods and services 
risk of concentrated ownership as of september   the company s officers and directors  and their affiliates beneficially own approximately million shares  constituting approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  may be able to exert significant influence over the election of directors and other corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
possible volatility of stock price the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  acceptance of satellite communication services in developing countries  and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have affected the market price of securities of many companies in the telecommunications and high technology industries 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
see quarterly fluctuations

as of june   the company had no such foreign currency forward contracts
