year as the year approaches  a critical issue has emerged for all companies  including the company  with respect to whether application software programs and operating systems utilized by a company and the companies with which it does business can accommodate this date value 
in brief  many existing application software products in the marketplace were designed only to accommodate a two digit date position which represents the year eg  is stored on the system and represents the year

as part of this review  the company has obtained assurances from each of such parties  whose dealings with continental information systems corporation and its subsidiaries the company are material to the company or its operations  that such party does not and will not utilize software or systems that may interfere with the company  or are or will be important to the operations of such party  that may cause problems to such party or the company as a result of the year conversion
