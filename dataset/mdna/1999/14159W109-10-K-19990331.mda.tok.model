item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of eclipse s expectations regarding future trends affecting its business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of please read the section below titled factors that may affect future results to review conditions which eclipse believes could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those items identified with a footnote symbol 
eclipse undertakes no obligation to update the information contained herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview eclipse was founded in from through september  eclipse engaged in the research  development and sale of surgical laser products principally for procedures such as atherectomy and arthroscopy 
in  eclipse determined that there was a significant opportunity in the transmyocardial revascularization tmr market  and that eclipse was well positioned to enter this market because of eclipse s expertise with laser based surgical techniques and the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
accordingly  in late  eclipse changed its strategic direction to enter the tmr market 
prior to  eclipse focused almost exclusively on research and development activities relating to surgical laser products 
since  eclipse has focused on tmr and percutaneous transmyocardial revascularization ptmr activities  particularly research and development activities and clinical trials 
at december   eclipse had an accumulated deficit of  on may   hcfa adopted a policy to restrict medicare reimbursement for tmr equipment and procedures 
eclipse s products had received third party reimbursement under the preceding hcfa policy 
reimbursement was a significant factor considered by hospitals in determining whether to acquire new equipment 
on october   eclipse announced the signing of a definitive agreement that provided for a business combination with cardiogenesis corporation cardiogenesis 
on march   eclipse and cardiogenesis announced the completion of their business combination 
under the terms of the combination  each share of cardiogenesis common stock has been converted into of a share of eclipse common stock  and eclipse has assumed all outstanding cardiogenesis stock options 
cardiogenesis has become a wholly owned subsidiary of eclipse and its shares will no longer be publicly traded 
as a result of the transaction  eclipse has increased its outstanding shares by approximately million shares which are issuable to the former cardiogenesis stockholders upon proper surrender of their stock certificates 
these shares represent approximately of eclipse s post combination outstanding shares 
the transaction has been structured to qualify as a tax free reorganization and will be accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on february   eclipse received final approval from the fda for its tmr products for certain indications and is now able to sell those products in the us on a commercial basis 
eclipse has also received the european conforming mark ce mark allowing the commercial sale of its tmr laser systems and its ptmr catheter system to customers in the european community 
in february  hcfa issued an indication of coverage for tmr procedures that are fda approved 
when hcfa issues final guidelines  hospitals will again receive medicare reimbursement for tmr equipment and procedures which is expected to result in a reduction in eclipse s costs of clinical trials 
eclipse expects to continue to incur operating losses related to the expansion of sales and marketing resources  research and development activities  including clinical studies  and the continued development of corporate infrastructure 
the timing and amounts of eclipse s expenditures will depend upon a number of factors  including the progress of eclipse s clinical trials  the status and timing of regulatory approvals  the timing of market acceptance  if any  of eclipse s products  and the efforts required to develop eclipse s sales and marketing organization 
forward looking statement 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues of  for the year ended december  increased  or when compared to net revenues of  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was a result of higher laser system and disposable product sales 
future revenues could continue to be affected by restrictions on third party reimbursement 
eclipse intends to continue selling its laser systems to hospitals outright or placing the systems with hospitals under lease or fee per use agreements 
gross profit gross profit increased to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  the increase resulted from greater sales volume and a higher average sales price per laser in compared to the increase in sales volumes in resulted in increased production volumes which resulted in lower per unit manufacturing costs as a result of production efficiencies 
research and development research and development expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in these expenses reflected a higher level of costs related to the development of new products  and increases in the number of clinical trials and the cost of supporting these trials 
on february   eclipse received fda approval for the tmr laser system 
tmr with the eclipse tmr laser system is approved for treatment of stable patients with angina canadian cardiovascular society class refractory to medical treatment and secondary to objectively demonstrated coronary artery atherosclerosis and with a region of the myocardium with reversible ischemia not amenable to direct coronary revascularization 
eclipse s products for other indications are currently in clinical trials and therefore subject to limitations by the fda 
eclipse believes that continued investment in the development of new and improved products and procedures and continued investment in eclipse s clinical trials is critical to its future success 
as a result of the fda approval of the eclipse surgical tmr system and the coverage notice by hcfa during  it is anticipated that the level of research and development expenditures incurred in connection with clinical trials will decrease 
there can be no assurance that eclipse s future revenues will be sufficient to cover the research and development expenses required in connection with ongoing efforts including current and future clinical trials 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to increases in headcount  sales commissions and physician training 
eclipse expects that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as eclipse continues to focus resources on the development of the tmr and ptmr market 
forward looking statement 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by  or to  in from  in the decrease in as compared to reflected a decrease in investor relations costs 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income of  decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to lower cash balances and lower investments in marketable securities in in november  the company contributed certain licenses  patents  and other intellectual property and the microheart name to microheart holdings  inc mhh in exchange for mhh common stock  representing less than of mhh s outstanding common stock and two warrants to acquire mhh common stock for an aggregate exercise price of approximately  in addition  the company has agreed to perform research and development related to the contributed technology over the next months  for which the company will be paid  by mhh 
eclipse has recorded a  investment and related gain on the contributed technology and revenue of  related to research and development performed on the contributed technology in the year ended december  interest expense of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was a result of a note payable held by eclipse s subsidiary  microheart  inc from october to october year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues of  for the year ended december  decreased  or when compared to net revenues of  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a change in the mix of lasers sold versus placed 
this change was primarily due to a hcfa policy effective may  which restricted medicare reimbursement for tmr equipment and procedures 
eclipse s products had received third party reimbursement under the preceding hcfa policy 
reimbursement was a significant factor considered by hospitals in determining whether to acquire new equipment 
gross profit gross profit decreased to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to  or of net revenues for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from a higher level of manufacturing overhead associated with facility and infrastructure expansion including increased headcount  as well as a lower average sales price per laser in due to the higher mix of lasers placed versus sold in as compared to research and development research and development expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in these expenses reflected a higher level of costs related to the development of new products  increases in the number of clinical trials and the cost of supporting these trials  and an increase in headcount to at december  from research and development employees at december  sales and marketing sales and marketing expenditures of  increased  or for the year ended december  when compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a headcount increase to in from nine in  which resulted in significant increases in salary  commission and travel expenses 
the additional headcount has been utilized in the areas of international sales  service  training and clinical support to the increasing number of clinical sites 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the increase for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  reflected an increase in patent and patent related expenses 
at december   eclipse had patents or allowed patent applications and patent applications pending relating to various aspects of tmr  ptmr and other cardiovascular therapies as compared to five and  respectively  at december  the increase also reflected expenses related to being a publicly traded company  including investor relations fees  legal  accounting and stock administration expenses  which were incurred throughout the year in as compared to seven months in interest and other income expense  net interest income of  increased  or for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to the funds received in connection with an initial public offering in may being invested for twelve months in as compared to seven months in interest expense of  decreased  or for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease reflected the use of funds from the initial public offering to repay debt  resulting in a lower debt level in as compared to liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities were  at december  compared to  at december   a decrease of 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are readily marketable at their fair market value 
eclipse used  of cash for operating activities  including funding its operating loss and increases in accounts receivable and inventory in since its inception  eclipse has satisfied its capital requirements primarily through sales of its equity securities and  to a lesser extent  loans from shareholders 
in addition  eclipse s operations have been funded in part through sales of eclipse s products 
at december   eclipse had an accumulated deficit of  eclipse anticipates that its current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet eclipse s funding requirements through at least december  
there can be no assurance  however  that eclipse will not require additional sources of cash at an earlier date in the future  depending upon the progress of expansion of eclipse s clinical trials  any need for additional clinical trials or other testing of eclipse s products  and the timing of other required expenditures as indicated above 
if eclipse is required to obtain additional financing in the future  there can be no assurance that capital will be available on terms acceptable to eclipse  if at all 
forward looking statement 
recently issued accounting standards management does not believe that there are any recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted by eclipse  the future adoption of which will have a material impact on eclipse s financial position or results of operations 
year compliance the year compliance issue in which systems do not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to creates risks for eclipse if internal data management  accounting  manufacturing and or operational software and systems do not adequately or accurately process or manage day or date information beyond the year to address the issue eclipse has assembled a cross functional project team to review and assess internal software  data management and accounting  manufacturing and operational systems to ensure that they do not malfunction as a result of the year date transition 
the project team has identified the following systems which are in the process of being evaluated security systems network equipment facility systems printers  copiers and fax machines telephony server tape backups servers testing equipment personal computers miscellaneous software the vast majority of eclipse s information systems hardware and software is already year compliant 
these same hardware and software systems are used for process controls in eclipse s manufacturing operations which do not depend otherwise upon date data oriented equipment 
eclipse does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as a result of any failure by eclipse to be in year compliance 
eclipse will estimate the cost to modify its systems to be year compliant as part of its assessment phase  however  at present  eclipse does not anticipate that the cost will be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
to date as well  eclipse believes that the cost is not material to its financial condition or results of operations 
eclipse s products have no internal date clocks  do not use software that is dependent on date data processing and do not have electrical ports for connection of other devices that require date date processing 
this means that eclipse products  when used as intended by eclipse in accordance with eclipse procedures and user service manuals  will not be affected by the change from to eclipse is also working with its suppliers of products  services and systems to assure that the products  services and systems supplied to eclipse  and the products eclipse supplies to its customers  are year compliant 
as a contingency plan  eclipse intends to maintain higher inventory levels at year end to mitigate any possible supplier delays 
with respect to compliance of the products eclipse supplies to its customers  the efforts are complete as eclipse s products are not dependent upon date data processing and the products do not have electrical ports for connection of other devices 
eclipse has not found it necessary to delay or cancel any internal services  programs  or projects as a result of its preparatory activities for year compliance 
eclipse does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as a result of any internal or external failures to be in year compliance  however  eclipse is prepared  as a worse case scenario  for minor delivery delays in the receipt of materials and services 
eclipse expects that its year compliance project will be completed prior to the second quarter of fiscal and will not have a material adverse effect on eclipse s financial condition or overall trends in the results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that unexpected delays or problems  forward looking statement 
including the failure to ensure the year compliance of systems  services or products supplied to eclipse by a third party  will not have an adverse effect on eclipse  its financial performance  or the competitiveness or customer acceptance of its products 
further  eclipse s current understanding of expected costs is subject to change as the project progresses and does not include the potential cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
factors affecting future results eclipse has identified certain forward looking statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report on form k with a footnote symbol 
eclipse may also make oral forward looking statements from time to time 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in any such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth below and elsewhere in this form k 
eclipse operates in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section lists some  but not all  of those risks and uncertainties which may have a material adverse effect on eclipse s business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part iv item of this annual report on form k 
eclipse may fail to obtain required regulatory approvals to market its products in the united states 
eclipse may not be able to obtain the regulatory approval required for commercial sale of its laser systems in a timely manner 
on february   eclipse received final approval from the fda for its tmr products for certain indications but  to date  none of its ptmr laser systems has been approved for sale in the us the business  financial condition and results of operations of eclipse could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following events  circumstances or occurrences related to the regulatory process delays in initiating or completing clinical trials or in the receipt of regulatory approvals  the failure to obtain regulatory approvals for such products  significant limitations in the indicated uses for which such products may be marketed  or substantial costs incurred in obtaining such approvals 
eclipse must submit and the fda must approve applications for preliminary market approval  known as a pma  before it can sell its laser systems as medical devices 
before submitting a pma application  eclipse must complete clinical testing to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of their products 
in  eclipse submitted a pma application to the fda for certain applications of its tmr laser system 
on october   an advisory panel of the fda recommended that the fda approve eclipse s pma application for the tmr laser system 
along with its approval  the fda panel requested that eclipse conduct postmarket surveillance in a form to be determined through further discussions with the fda 
on february   eclipse received final approval from the fda for its tmr products 
eclipse also has applied for and received ides to engage in various clinical trials of its ptmr products and procedures 
eclipse must successfully complete clinical trials of its ptmr products and procedures before filing a pma application for those products and procedures 
eclipse products may contain defects which could delay regulatory approval or market acceptance of its products 
eclipse may experience future product defects  malfunctions  manufacturing difficulties or recalls related to the lasers or other components used in its laser systems 
any such occurrence could cause a delay in future regulatory approvals or adversely affect the acceptance of its products and could have a material adverse effect on eclipse s business  financial condition and results of operations 
eclipse may fail to comply with international regulatory requirements and could be subject to regulatory delays  fines or other penalties 
regulatory requirements in foreign countries for international sales of medical devices often vary from country to country 
the impact of the following factors would have a material adverse effect on eclipse s business  financial condition and results of operations delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  foreign regulatory approvals or clearances  the loss of previously obtained approvals or clearances  or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements 
eclipse s products are subject to other regulatory requirements in the european union and other countries 
any enforcement action by regulatory authorities with respect to past or future regulatory noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on eclipse s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the time required to obtain approval for sale in foreign countries may be longer or shorter than required for fda approval  and the requirements may differ 
in addition  there may be foreign regulatory barriers other than regulatory approval 
except as stated in the following sentence  the fda must approve exports of devices that require a pma but are not yet approved domestically 
an unapproved device may be exported without prior fda approval to any member country of the european union and the other listed countries  including australia  canada  israel  japan  new zealand  switzerland and south africa if the device is approved for sale by that country  or the device is for investigational use in accordance with the laws of that country 
eclipse received the ce mark for its tmr laser system in december and for its ptmr laser system in july in the european economic area  eclipse will be subject to continued supervision  required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities  and required to comply with additional national requirements that are outside the scope of the medical device directive 
eclipse became iso certified in may eclipse may not be able to achieve or maintain the compliance required for ce marking on all or any of its products  or produce its products profitably and in a timely manner while complying with the requirements of the medical device directive and other regulatory requirements 
if eclipse fails to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements it could face fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspensions of production  refusals by foreign governments to permit product sales  and criminal prosecution 
furthermore  if existing regulations are changed or new regulations or policies are adopted  eclipse may not be able to obtain  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals or clearances  not be able to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all  and be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining such foreign regulatory approvals 
eclipse products are experimental and have not been broadly adopted by the medical community and unless they are broadly adopted eclipse s business will be adversely affected 
tmr and ptmr products using lasers are experimental and have not yet achieved broad clinical adoption 
eclipse cannot predict whether or at what rate and how broadly its products will be adopted by the medical community 
the business  financial condition and results of operations of eclipse may be adversely affected if its products fail to achieve significant clinical adoptions  or its tmr or ptmr laser systems fail to achieve significant market acceptance 
positive endorsements by physicians are essential for clinical adoption of tmr and ptmr laser systems 
even if the clinical efficacy of tmr and ptmr laser systems is established  physicians may elect not to recommend tmr or ptmr laser systems for any number of reasons 
the reasons why tmr or ptmr laser systems may effectively treat coronary artery disease are not well understood 
although eclipse intends to use research  development and clinical efforts to understand better the physiological effects of tmr and ptmr treatments  eclipse may not achieve such understanding on a timely basis  or at all 
tmr and ptmr laser systems may not be clinically adopted unless eclipse understands thoroughly the physiological effects of the products  and disseminates such understanding within the medical community 
clinical adoption of these products will also depend upon the ability of eclipse to facilitate training of cardiothoracic surgeons and interventional cardiologists in tmr and ptmr therapy  and the willingness of such physicians to adopt and recommend such procedures to their patients 
patient acceptance of the procedure will depend on physician recommendations  the degree of invasiveness  the effectiveness of the procedure  and the rate and severity of complications associated with the procedure as compared to other procedures 
eclipse products depend on tmr technology which is rapidly changing  which could require eclipse to incur substantial product development expenditures to respond to industry changes 
tmr and ptmr laser systems are the only products of eclipse 
accordingly  if eclipse fails to develop and commercialize successfully its tmr and ptmr laser systems  then its business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
the future success of eclipse will depend in large part on its ability to respond to such changes 
in addition  eclipse must expand the indications and applications for its products by developing and introducing enhanced and new versions of its tmr and ptmr laser systems 
product research and development requires substantial expenditures and is inherently risky 
eclipse may not be able to identify products for which demand exists  or develop products that have the characteristics necessary to treat particular indications 
even if eclipse identifies and develops such products  it may not receive regulatory approval and may not be commercially successful 
third parties may limit the development and protection of eclipse s intellectual property which could adversely affect its competitive position 
the success of eclipse is dependent in large part on its ability to obtain patent protection for its products and processes  preserve its trade secrets and proprietary technology  and operate without infringing upon the patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
certain competitors and potential competitors of eclipse have obtained us patents covering technology that could be used for certain tmr and ptmr procedures 
there can be no assurance such competitors  potential competitors or others have not filed and do not hold international patents covering other tmr or ptmr technology 
in addition  international patents may not be interpreted the same as any counterpart us patents 
in september  one of eclipse s competitors sent eclipse a notice of potential infringement of their patent regarding a method for tmr utilizing synchronization of laser pulses to the electrical signals from the heart 
after discussion with patent counsel  eclipse concluded that it did not utilize the process and or apparatus that was the subject of the patent at issue  and eclipse provided a response to the competitor to that effect 
eclipse has not received any additional correspondence from this competitor on these matters 
while eclipse periodically reviews the scope of its patents and other relevant patents of which it is aware  the question of patent infringement involves complex legal and factual issues 
any conclusion regarding infringement may not be consistent with the resolution of any such issues by a court 
eclipse may not be able to protect its intellectual property because patents may not be issued  patents may be challenged  invalidated or designed around by competitors  or patent protection may not continue to be available for surgical methods in the future 
costly litigation may be necessary to protect intellectual property rights 
eclipse may have to engage in time consuming and costly litigation to protect its intellectual property rights or to determine the proprietary rights of others 
in addition  eclipse may become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation  or interference proceedings declared by the us patent office to determine the priority of inventions 
defending and prosecuting intellectual property suits  us patent office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming 
eclipse may be required to litigate further to enforce its issued patents  protect its trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation or interference proceedings will result in substantial expense  and a significant diversion of effort by technical and management personnel 
if the results of such litigation or interference proceedings are adverse to eclipse  then the results may subject eclipse to significant liabilities to third parties  require eclipse to seek licenses from third parties  prevent eclipse from selling its products in certain markets  or at all  or require eclipse to modify its products 
although patent and intellectual property disputes regarding medical devices are often settled through licensing and similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent eclipse from manufacturing and selling its products 
this would have a material adverse effect on eclipse s business  financial condition and results of operations 
eclipse relies on patent and trade secret laws which are complex and may be difficult to enforce 
the validity and breadth of claims in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  may be highly uncertain 
issued patents or patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent application may not exclude competitors or may not provide a competitive advantage to eclipse 
in addition  patents issued or licensed to eclipse may not be held valid if subsequently challenged and others may claim rights in or ownership of such patents 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that competitors have not developed or will not develop similar products  will not duplicate products of eclipse  or will not design around any patents issued to or licensed by eclipse 
since patent applications in the us are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  eclipse cannot be certain others did not first file applications for inventions covered by their pending patent applications  nor that they will not infringe any patents that may issue to others on such applications 
the us patent laws were recently amended to exempt physicians  other healthcare professionals  and affiliated entities from infringement liability for medical and surgical procedures performed on patients 
eclipse is not able to predict if this amendment will materially affect its ability to protect its proprietary methods and procedures 
competitors may independently develop proprietary information substantially equivalent to the proprietary information and techniques of eclipse  or otherwise gain access to its proprietary technology 
in addition to its patents  eclipse relies upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position 
eclipse may not be able to meaningfully protect its unpatented technology because its employees  consultants and advisors may breach their confidentiality and invention assignment agreements and there may not be an adequate remedy for such breach  its competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  or competitors may otherwise gain access to eclipse s proprietary technology 
the inability of eclipse to protect its unpatented intellectual property could materially adversely affect its business 
eclipse faces intense competition and competitive products could render its products obsolete 
the market for tmr and ptmr laser systems is intensely competitive and is constantly becoming more competitive 
if competitors are more effective in developing new products and procedures and marketing existing and future products  the business  financial condition and results of operations of eclipse may be materially adversely affected 
the market for tmr and ptmr laser systems is characterized by rapid technical innovation 
accordingly  competitors may succeed in developing tmr and ptmr products or procedures that are more effective than products marketed by eclipse  are more effectively marketed than products marketed by eclipse  or may render the products or technology of eclipse obsolete 
eclipse competes with plc systems  inc  us surgical corporation  and johnson johnson 
each of these competitors are currently selling tmr and or ptmr products for investigational use in the us and abroad 
certain companies  including plc  have completed enrollment in randomized clinical trials of products and procedures involving tmr  and received regulatory approvals in us and europe to begin commercially marketing their various tmr products 
earlier entrants in the market in a therapeutic area often obtain and maintain greater market share than later entrants 
plc obtained a pma approval of it s tmr laser system in and thus  would be able to capture a greater market share 
even with the fda approval for it s tmr laser  will face competition for market acceptance and market share for that product 
eclipse s ability to compete may depend in significant part on the timing of the introduction of competitive products into the market  which will be affected by the pace  relative to competitors  at which it is able to develop products  complete clinical testing and regulatory approval processes  obtain third party reimbursement acceptance  and supply adequate quantities of the product to the market 
eclipse sells its products internationally which subjects it to certain significant risks of transacting business in foreign countries 
the international revenue of eclipse is subject to the following risks foreign currency fluctuations  economic or political instability  foreign tax laws  shipping delays  various tariffs and trade regulations  restrictions and foreign medical regulations  customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions  and difficulty in protecting intellectual property rights 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of eclipse 
eclipse s products also compete with alternative treatment methods and its products must replace these methods to be commercially successful 
many of the medical indications that may be treatable with tmr and ptmr laser systems are currently being treated by drug therapies or surgery and other interventional therapies  including percutanous transluminal coronary angioplasty known as ptca and coronary artery bypass grafts 
the business  financial condition and results of operations of eclipse would be materially adversely affected if tmr technology fails to replace or augment existing therapies  or to be more effective  safer or more cost effective than new therapies 
a number of the existing therapies are widely accepted in the medical community  have a long history of use  and continue to be enhanced rapidly 
procedures using tmr and ptmr technology may not be able to replace or augment such established treatments 
clinical research results may not support the use of tmr or ptmr procedures to augment or replace existing treatments 
others are developing new surgical procedures and new drug therapies to treat coronary artery disease 
these new procedures and drug therapies could be more effective  safer or more cost effective than tmr and ptmr laser systems 
the market acceptance and commercial success of eclipse s tmr and ptmr laser systems will depend not only upon their safety and effectiveness  but also upon the relative safety and effectiveness of alternative treatments 
eclipse has a history of losses and may not be profitable in the future 
eclipse has incurred significant losses since inception and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
eclipse s revenues and operating income will be constrained until such time  as eclipse obtains fda and other regulatory approvals for its ptmr products  for an uncertain period of time after such approvals are obtained  and until the medical community embraces laser systems as an effective treatment for coronary artery disease 
if eclipse experiences increased demand for its products  it may not be able to expand its business to meet such demand 
eclipse may be required to expand its business to complete the clinical trials that are currently in progress  prepare additional products for clinical trials  develop future products  and generally compete successfully 
such expansion could place a significant strain on eclipse s managerial  operational and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate such expansion and compete effectively  eclipse must improve information systems  procedures and controls  and expand  train  motivate and manage its employees 
eclipse depends on single source suppliers for certain key components and production could be interrupted if a key supplier had to be replaced 
eclipse currently purchases certain critical laser and fiber optic components from single sources 
although eclipse has identified alternative suppliers  a lengthy process would be required to qualify them as additional or replacement suppliers 
any significant interruption in the supply of critical materials or components could adversely affect the ability of eclipse to manufacture its products and could materially adversely affect its manufacturing operations  business and results of operations 
eclipse anticipates that products will be manufactured based on forecasted demand and will seek to purchase subassemblies and components in anticipation of the actual receipt of purchase orders from customers 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly and depend on factors such as the business practices of each specific supplier and the terms of particular contracts  as well as the overall market demand for such materials and components at any given time 
if the forecasts are inaccurate  eclipse could experience fluctuations in inventory levels  resulting in excess inventory  or shortages of critical components  either of which could materially adversely affect its business and results of operations 
certain suppliers to eclipse could have difficulty expanding their manufacturing capacity to meet the needs of eclipse if demand for eclipse s tmr and ptmr laser systems were to increase rapidly or significantly 
in addition  any defect or malfunction in the laser or other products provided by such suppliers could cause a delay in regulatory approvals or adversely affect product acceptance 
there can be no assurance that materials obtained from outside suppliers will continue to be available in adequate quantities  or alternative suppliers can be located on a timely basis 
eclipse operates on a purchase order basis with most of its suppliers 
such vendors could at any time determine to cease the supply and production of such components 
eclipse has limited manufacturing experience which could prevent it from successfully increasing capacity in response to market demand 
eclipse has limited experience in manufacturing products 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production  including problems involving production yields  adequate supplies of components  quality control and assurance including failure to comply with gmp regulations  international quality standards and other regulatory requirements  and shortages of qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that eclipse will be able to successfully increase manufacturing capacity  or will be able to avoid manufacturing difficulties or product recalls 
eclipse must comply with fda manufacturing standards or face fines or other penalties including suspension of production 
eclipse is required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practices regulations if it markets devices in the us or manufactures finished devices in the us the fda inspects manufacturing facilities on a regular basis to determine compliance 
if they fail to comply with applicable fda or other regulatory requirements  eclipse can be subject to fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspensions of production  and criminal prosecutions 
to expand its business  eclipse will be required to establish effective sales  marketing and distribution processes and it has limited experience to date establishing these operations 
to expand its business  eclipse must establish effective processes to sell  market and distribute products 
to date  eclipse has had limited sales which have consisted primarily of sales of its tmr and ptmr laser systems for investigational use only 
for this reason  eclipse has maintained only a limited sales and marketing organization 
with the recent fda approval of it s tmr laser  eclipse expects to market its tmr products through a direct sales force and through relationships with distributors or agents 
this will require substantial management efforts and financial resources 
if eclipse is not able to establish relationships with distributors  or if such distributors are not effective  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
eclipse may need additional capital or it will be unable to continue expanding its clinical trials and testing its products 
eclipse currently anticipates that its cash balances  together with sales of products for investigational and approved use  will be sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the next twelve months 
if eclipse cannot raise enough additional funds  it may not be able to continue expanding its clinical trials and testing its products 
if this were to occur  eclipse s business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects would be materially adversely affected 
eclipse may require additional sources of cash at an earlier date 
the need for additional cash will depend upon the progress or expansion of clinical trials and any need for additional trials or other testing of products and the timing of these expenditures 
additional financing may not be available when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
eclipse will be unable to obtain additional fda approval if its products are not proven safe and effective in clinical sites 
the fda has not approved eclipse s ptmr laser systems for any indication in the united states 
there can be no assurance regarding the clinical safety or efficacy of such systems 
conducting clinical trials will require substantial financial and management resources  and take several years 
eclipse cannot determine if its tmr and ptmr laser systems will prove to be safe or effective 
the business  financial condition  and results of operations of eclipse will be materially and aversely affected if its tmr and ptmr laser systems do not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials 
eclipse may suffer losses from product liability claims if its products cause harm to patients 
eclipse is exposed to potential product liability claims  and product recalls 
these risks are inherent in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
eclipse s products are designed to be used in life threatening situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or death and eclipse could be subject to product liability claims if the use of its tmr or ptmr laser systems is alleged to have caused adverse effects on a patient or such products are believed to be defective 
any regulatory clearance for commercial sale of these products will not remove these risks 
any failure to comply with the fda s gmp or other regulations could have a material adverse effect on the ability of eclipse to defend against product liability lawsuits 
although eclipse has never experienced any product liability claims to date  any such claims could have a material adverse effect on eclipse s business  financial condition and results of operations 
eclipse s insurance may be insufficient to cover product liability claims 
there can be no assurance that the product liability insurance maintained by eclipse will be adequate for any future product liability problems  or continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if eclipse was held liable for a product liability claim or series of claims in excess of its insurance coverage  such liability could have a material and adverse effect on eclipse s business  financial condition and results of operations 
eclipse maintains insurance against product liability claims in the amount of million per occurrence  and million in the aggregate 
these coverage limits may not adequately protect eclipse from liabilities it may incur in connection with the development  manufacture and sale of its products since tmr technology is not well understood  and there is a lack of data regarding the clinical safety and efficacy of tmr and ptmr laser systems 
eclipse may require increased product liability coverage if any products are commercialized 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
eclipse may experience adverse effects related to year issues affecting its suppliers 
many currently installed computer systems and software products experience functional difficulty distinguishing between the year from the year this is commonly known as the year problem 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to function properly in the future 
as the products that eclipse itself supplies to its customers are not dependent upon date data processing and do not have electrical ports for the connection of other devices  eclipse believes that these products are year compliant 
eclipse does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as a result of any internal or external year compliance problems 
however  eclipse will prepare for minor delays in the receipt of materials and services as a result of third parties failures to meet year requirements 
eclipse cannot assure you that its preparations will be successful or that it will not experience unexpected delays or problems as a result of year problems 
eclipse is also working with its suppliers to ensure that its suppliers are year compliant 
if eclipse is not able to procure adequate supplies  it will not be able to manufacture and sell its products  which would have a significant material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
eclipse believes that the foregoing describes its most reasonably likely worst case year scenario 
as a contingency plan  eclipse intends to maintain higher inventory levels at year end to mitigate any possible supplier delays 
with respect to compliance of the products eclipse supplies to its customers  the efforts are complete as eclipse s products are not dependent upon date data processing and the products do not have electrical ports for connection of other devices 
eclipse has not found it necessary to delay or cancel any internal services  programs  or projects as a result of its preparatory activities for year compliance 
eclipse does not anticipate any material disruption in its operations as a result of any internal or external failures to be in year compliance  however  eclipse is prepared  as a worse case scenario  for minor delivery delays in the receipt of materials and services 
eclipse expects that its year compliance project will be completed prior to the second quarter of fiscal and will not have a material adverse effect on eclipse s financial condition or overall trends in the results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that unexpected delays or problems  including the failure to ensure the year compliance of systems  services or products supplied to eclipse by a third party  will not have an adverse effect on eclipse  its financial performance  or the competitiveness or customer acceptance of its products 
further  eclipse s current understanding of expected costs is subject to change as the project progresses and does not include the potential cost of internal software and hardware replaced in the normal course of business 
the operating results of eclipse are expected to fluctuate and quarter to quarter comparisons of its results may not indicate future performance 
eclipse s operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and are expected to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a number of events and factors  including the timing and results of clinical trials  delays associated with the fda and other regulatory approval processes  the enactment of healthcare reform legislation and any changes in third party reimbursement policies  the level of product demand and the timing of customer orders  changes in competitive pricing policies  the ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of products on a timely basis  deferrals in customer orders in anticipation of new and enhanced products  product quality problems  personnel changes  changes in strategy  and the level of international sales 
eclipse believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its operating results may not be a good indication of its future performance 
it is likely that the operating results of eclipse for a future quarter will forward looking statement 
fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of eclipse s common stock may fall  perhaps substantially 
eclipse may not be able to successfully market its products if it fails to obtain acceptance of third party reimbursement for the procedures performed with its products 
few individuals are able to pay directly for the costs associated with the use of eclipse s products 
in the us  hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third party payors  such as medicare  to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure in which the medical device is being used 
a failure by third party payors to provide adequate reimbursement from the tmr and ptmr procedures that use eclipse s products would have a material adverse effect on eclipse s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in january  hcfa announced coverage policy for fda approved tmr systems for any manufacturer s tmr procedures 
eclipse has limited experience to date with the acceptability of its tmr procedures for reimbursement by private insurance and private health plans 
there can be no assurance that private insurance and private health plans will approve reimbursement for tmr or ptmr 
although eclipse does not anticipate receiving reimbursements for their laser systems from medicare during their clinical trials  it will seek reimbursement from other third party payors 
there can be no assurance  however  that such reimbursement will be available 
third party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in a treatment is unnecessary  inappropriate  experimental  used for a non approved indication  or not cost effective 
potential purchasers must determine whether the clinical benefits of eclipse s tmr and ptmr laser systems justify the additional cost or the additional effort required to obtain prior authorization or coverage  and the uncertainty of actually obtaining such authorization or coverage 
eclipse may not achieve wide acceptance of its products in foreign markets if it fails to obtain third party reimbursements for the procedures performed with its products 
if eclipse obtains the necessary foreign regulatory registrations or approvals  market acceptance of its products in international markets would be dependent  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country 
they include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance 
although eclipse expects to seek international reimbursement approvals  there can be no assurance that any such approvals will be obtained in a timely manner  if at all 
failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have a material adverse effect on the market acceptance of tmr and ptmr products in the international markets in which such approvals are sought 
overall increases in medical costs could adversely affect eclipse s business 
eclipse believes that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led  and will continue to lead  to increased pressures on the healthcare industry  both foreign and domestic  to reduce the cost of products and services  including products offered by it 
there can be no assurance in either us or international markets that third party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate  current reimbursement amounts will not be decreased in the future  or future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors will not otherwise adversely affect the demand for or the ability of eclipse to profitably sell its products 
fundamental reforms in the healthcare industry in the us and europe continue to be considered 
eclipse cannot predict whether or when any healthcare reform proposals will be adopted and what effect such proposals might have on its business 
completion of business combination with cardiogenesis 
on march   eclipse announced the completion of the business combination between cardiogenesis and itself 
eclipse may  from time to time  acquire or invest in other complementary businesses  products or technologies 
while there are currently no commitments with respect to any particular acquisition or investment  other than the transaction with cardiogenesis  eclipse s management frequently evaluates the strategic opportunities available related to complimentary businesses  products or technologies 
the process of integrating an acquired company s business into eclipse s operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of eclipse s business 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment will be realized 
the business combination with cardiogenesis or any future acquisitions or investments by eclipse could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect eclipse s operating results and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel 
eclipse s future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key technical and senior management personnel 
douglas murphy chutorian  md  will remain as chairman of the board of the combined company 
allen w 
hill  president and chief executive officer of cardiogenesis  has also become president and chief executive officer of the combined company 
richard l 
mueller  jr  will no longer continue to be president and chief operating officer 
eclipse maintained key person life insurance policies on both dr 
murphy chutorian and mr 
mueller in the amount of million in total and intend to maintain similar insurance in the future for its key personnel 
eclipse s future business and results of operations also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain additional qualified management  manufacturing  technical  marketing and sales and support personnel for its operations 
competition for such personnel is intense  and eclipse may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
if eclipse loses a key employee or if a key employee fails to perform in his or her current position  or if eclipse is not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk eclipse has an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
eclipse attempts to limit this exposure by investing in securities that will mature within months
