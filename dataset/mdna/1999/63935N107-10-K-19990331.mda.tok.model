overview we are a leading nationwide provider of consulting services to energy based and other network and regulated industries 
we offer a wide range of consulting services designed to assist our clients as they face changing regulation  increasing competition and evolving technology 
the company s services include management consulting  information technology  and litigation support 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees for professional services 
over the last three years  the substantial majority of our revenues have been generated under standard hourly or daily rates billed on a time and expenses basis 
our clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
our most significant expenses are project personnel costs  which consist of consultant salaries and benefits  and travel related direct project expenses 
we typically employ our project personnel on a full time basis  although we supplement our project personnel through the use of independent contractors 
we retain contractors for specific client engagements on a task specific  per diem basis during the period their expertise or skills are required 
we believe that retaining contractors on a per engagement basis provides us with greater flexibility in adjusting project personnel levels in response to changes in demand for our services 
acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we expect to continue to pursue complementary acquisitions to expand our geographic reach  expand the breadth and depth of our service offerings and enhance our consultant base 
in furtherance of this growth strategy  we have acquired fourteen consulting firms during and all of these transactions were accounted for as pooling of interests 
the following summarizes the significant pooling of interests acquisitions that we have made since our initial public offering through the end of rmi 
as of july   we acquired substantially all of the common stock of resource management international  inc in exchange for million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and acquired the remaining minority interest in exchange for cash 
rmi  based in sacramento  california  is a leading provider of consulting services to gas  water  and electric utilities  with operations in the western and eastern united states and international marketplace 
rmi s broad range of engineering  technical and economic regulatory services complemented our management consulting and information technology services 
reed 
as of august   we acquired substantially all of the common stock of reed consulting group  inc in exchange for million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and acquired the remaining minority interest in exchange for cash 
reed  based in the boston  massachusetts area  provides strategic planning  operations management and economic and regulatory services to electric and natural gas utilities 
reed s operations expanded our services and client base in the northeast united states and internationally 
lecg 
as of august   we acquired substantially all of the common stock of lecg  inc in exchange for million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and acquired the remaining minority interest in exchange for cash 
lecg  based in the san francisco  california area  is a leading provider of economic consulting and litigation support services 
lecg s operations further increased our economic and regulatory expertise and expanded our presence in the telecommunications industry

peterson  based in the chicago  illinois area  is a leading provider of information management services 
peterson s operations expanded our service offerings in the area of information technology 
we acquired lecg and peterson in august these acquisitions are the largest we have made to date and we are in the process of integrating these companies  including their accounting and billing functions  into our operations 
an inability to effectively integrate these or any companies acquired in the future may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully on engagements and to grow our business 
performance problems or dissatisfied clients at one company could have an adverse effect on our reputation as a whole 
if our reputation were damaged  this could make it more difficult to market our services or to acquire additional companies in the future 
in addition  acquired companies may not operate profitably 
acquisitions also involve a number of additional risks  including  among others  the following diversion of management s attention  potential loss of key clients or personnel  risks associated with unanticipated assumed liabilities and problems  and risks of managing businesses or entering markets in which we have limited or no direct expertise 
we expect to continue to acquire companies as an element of our growth strategy 
acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth to differ from our expectations 
for example we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to acquire additional consulting firms on favorable terms 
we compete with other companies to acquire consulting firms 
we cannot predict whether this competition will increase 
if competition does increase  there may be fewer suitable consulting firms available to be acquired and the price for suitable acquisitions may increase 
we may not be able to integrate the operations accounting and billing functions  for example of businesses we acquire to realize the economic  operational and other benefits we anticipate 
we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses in a timely manner or we may incur substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems during the integration process 
it may be difficult to integrate a business with personnel who have different business backgrounds and corporate cultures
