the company currently intends to fund these activities from its existing cash resources  sales of products and research and development funding received from others 
while the company believes that its existing available funds will be sufficient to meet its present operating and capital requirements through at least  there can be no assurance that such sources of funds will be sufficient to meet these future expenses 
if adequate funds are not available  the company expects it will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of its product development programs 
the company s need for additional financing will be principally dependent on the degree of market acceptance achieved by the company s products and the extent to which the company can achieve substantial growth in product sales during and  as well as the extent to which the company may decide to expand its product development efforts

as of december   lifecell had net operating loss nol and research and development tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million and  respectively  available to reduce future income tax and tax liabilities 
federal tax laws provide for a limitation on the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes that could limit lifecell s ability to use its nol and tax credit carryforwards 
the company s sale of common stock in the public offering resulted in an ownership change for federal income tax purposes 
the company estimates that the amount of nol carryforwards and the credits available to offset taxable income as of december  is approximately million on a cumulative basis 
accordingly  if lifecell generates taxable income in any year in excess of its then cumulative limitation  the company may be required to pay federal income taxes even though it has unexpired nol carryforwards
