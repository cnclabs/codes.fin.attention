item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
information relating to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations shall be set forth under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report to stockholders  except for the discussion of risk factors affecting future performance 
such information is incorporated herein by reference 
risk factors affecting future performance we must adapt to changes in technology  products  industry standards and customer needs 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
also  customer needs frequently change  and competitors constantly introduce new products and services 
to be successful  we must 
use leading technologies effectively  
continue developing our technical expertise  
enhance our existing products and services  
develop new products and services  and 
meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost effective basis 
if we fail to do any of these things  our customers may choose to purchase products and services from our competitors 
we continually introduce our products and services into new markets 
if our products do not adequately meet the demands of these new markets  we could experience decreased revenues 
we could experience difficulties in the development of products and services for new and existing markets that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these products and services 
our failure to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner  or the lack of success of a new release of a product in the market  would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 
over the last three years  we have greatly expanded our operations  placing considerable demand on our administrative  operational and financial personnel and systems 
further expansion may place additional strains on our resources 
to address these expansion issues  we may have to make substantial expenditures and devote further management time and resources to 
improve or replace our management information  financial and other reporting systems  
standardize bscs installation methods  
further develop our infrastructure  
develop and coordinate strategies  operations and product development among our operations in the americas  europe and asia  
maintain customer satisfaction  
manage changing business conditions  and 
recruit  train and retain qualified consulting  technical  sales  financial  marketing and management personnel 
we cannot assure you that our existing resources  systems and space will be able to adequately support our further expansion 
our failure to respond appropriately to growth and change would likely result in a material adverse effect on the quality of our services  our ability to retain key personnel and our business 
we depend on large contracts from a limited number of customers 
we provide customized billing and customer handling systems to telecommunications carriers in the wireline and wireless markets 
although no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues in  we have traditionally relied upon  and expect to continue to rely upon  large contracts from a limited number of customers 
this can cause our revenues and earnings to fluctuate between quarters based on the timing of orders and realization of revenues from these orders 
some of the telecommunications industry s established carriers are forming alliances  while others are consolidating 
if a consolidation or alliance involves one of our customers  that customer may switch to another billing system 
in addition  none of our major customers has any obligation to purchase additional products or services from us 
the loss of one or more of our major customers because of industry consolidation or otherwise would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on developing relationships with new customers in a very competitive telecommunications market 
the wireline and wireless markets have grown significantly and become much more competitive in recent years 
this growth may not continue  and we may not be able to successfully market and sell our products in these competitive markets 
it is critical to our continued success that we develop relationships with new customers 
our failure to develop relationships with new customers  or the failure of our customers to compete effectively in the telecommunications market  would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
many of our potential customers are new entrants in the telecommunications market and lack significant financial and other resources 
we may be required to offer them alternative pricing arrangements  including deferred payments  if we want these new market entrants to be our customers 
we may not be able to develop customer relationships with these new entrants  but even if we do  there is no guarantee that these customers will be successful 
if they are not successful  they may reduce or discontinue their purchases from us 
if we have permitted customers to pay us on a deferred basis  we may be unable to collect payments from these customers 
any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we cannot assure you that expansion of our products and services into new geographic markets and applications will be successful 
we plan to continue expanding our products and services into new geographic markets and to carriers offering new applications of their telecommunications services 
our failure to successfully establish ourselves in new markets would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business 
our success is dependent on our relationships with consulting firms and systems integration firms 
consulting firms and systems integration firms help us with marketing  sales  lead generation  customer support and installation of our products 
in order to grow successfully  we must maintain our relationships with these firms and generate new business opportunities through joint marketing and sales with them 
we also serve as subcontractor to consulting firms and systems integration firms where those firms provide information technology to end user customers 
in these cases we depend heavily on these firms to install our products and to train end users to use our products 
incorrect product installation  failure to properly train the end user  or general failure of the firm to satisfy the customer could have a negative effect on our relationships with the contracting firm and the customer 
such problems could damage our reputation and the reputation of our products and services 
obstacles we may encounter to forging long term relationships with consulting and systems integration firms include 
we have no exclusive agreements with any consulting and systems integration firms  
many consulting and systems integration firms have more established relationships with our principal competitors  and 
many consulting and systems integration firms have the resources to compete with us by developing their own products and services 
these firms may discontinue their relationships with us and or develop relationships with our competitors 
our inability to establish and maintain effective  long term relationships with these firms  and their failure to meet the needs of our customers  would likely adversely affect our business 
prior to  we had contracts pursuant to which we gave certain systems integration firms our kernel source code and the right to market and sell versions of our products that these firms independently modified 
a few us carriers had problems with our products as modified and installed by these firms 
this damaged our reputation and credibility and that of our products  and we may have lost the confidence of the affected carriers 
although we have terminated all of these types of contracts  we cannot assure you that there will not be further damage to our reputation and credibility in the us that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the telecommunications billing and customer care systems industry is very competitive 
the telecommunications billing and customer care systems industry is very competitive 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
some of the independent providers we compete with are 
alltel 
amdocs 
cbis 
itds 
kenan 
kingston scl 
sema group we also compete with systems integrators and internal billing departments of larger telecommunications carriers 
many of our competitors have advantages over us  including 
longer operating histories  
larger customer bases  
substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  and 
greater name recognition 
our current and potential competitors have established  and may continue to establish in the future  cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to compete with us 
in addition  competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs  or to devote more resources to promoting and selling their products 
new competitors or alliances among competitors could also result in these competitors quickly gaining significant market share 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in our markets is affected by these principal factors 
development of competing software and services  
price of competing software and services  
responsiveness to customer needs  and 
hiring  retaining and motivating key personnel 
our failure to adapt to market demands and to compete successfully with existing and new competitors would have a material adverse effect on our business 
as we expand  we will market our products and services to carriers in markets that we do not currently serve 
we may encounter new competitors upon entry into these markets that may have greater financial  technical  personnel and marketing resources than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify and address the demands for these new markets or that we can continue to compete effectively in our current markets 
our failure to maintain our competitiveness in current or new markets would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key management  sales  product development and operational personnel  including hartmut lademacher  chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
since it is our goal to continue our expansion  our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
competition is intense for the recruitment of highly qualified personnel in the software and telecommunications services industry 
we may not be able to successfully retain or integrate existing personnel or identify and hire additional personnel 
our inability to hire and retain qualified personnel would likely have a material adverse effect upon our current business  new product development efforts and future business prospects 
we do not currently maintain key person insurance coverage for any of our employees 
the success of our international business operations is subject to many uncertainties 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the americas 
in each of and  our sales outside the americas represented approximately of our total revenues 
we expect a majority of our revenues to continue to be provided from our european and asian operations 
our international business may be adversely affected by the following 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
tariffs and other trade barriers  
difficulties in customizing our products for use in foreign countries  
longer accounts receivable payment cycles  
difficulties in managing international operations  
availability of trained personnel to install and implement our systems  
political instability  
potentially adverse tax obligations  
restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and 
the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to as great an extent as the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international revenues and earnings or our overall financial performance 
if we cannot provide financing for potential customers  we may not get their business 
certain of our potential customers may require financing to fund purchases of our products 
in particular  our ability to increase sales to start up telecommunications carriers with limited financial resources in the future will depend significantly upon our ability to arrange financing for these customers 
we may not be able to successfully implement a vendor financing program for these customers or to assist them in obtaining alternative financing for our products 
in such event  we will have decreased revenues 
failure to obtain year compliance may negatively affect our business 
the term year issue is used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year is approached and reached 
these problems could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of our operations  including an inability to process transactions  send invoices  or engage in similar normal business activities 
although we believe that our internal systems and software products are year compliant  we are vulnerable to the risk that our customers  government agencies  significant suppliers and other third parties will not be able to remedy their own year issues 
we rely  both domestically and internationally  upon government agencies  utility companies  telecommunication service companies and other service providers outside of our control 
such suppliers  governmental agencies  or other third parties or our customers may suffer a year business disruption 
such failures could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have not developed a contingency plan to address the results of our analysis of the most reasonably likely worst case year scenarios 
consequently  we are not able to determine at this time whether the consequences of year failures will have a material impact on our operations  but they may 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and other currencies in which we do business may result in currency translation losses 
a significant portion of our revenues are denominated in the german deutsche mark 
we also have revenues denominated in the swiss franc and the malaysian ringgit 
the value of the german deutsche mark against the euro was fixed upon the introduction of the euro in january  consequently  fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro may have a material adverse effect our business  operating results and financial condition and could also result in significant exchange losses 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of transacting business in certain foreign locations in currencies other than the functional currency of the location 
we attempt to balance our revenues and expenses in each currency to minimize net foreign currency risk 
to the extent that we are unable to balance revenues and expenses in a currency  fluctuations in the value of the currency in which we conduct our business relative to the functional currency have caused and will continue to cause currency transaction gains and losses 
we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 
we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates but may undertake such transactions in the future 
any hedging techniques which we implement in the future may not be successful  and exchange rate losses could be exacerbated by hedging techniques that we use 
our european operations expose us to heightened euro conversion risks 
because of our significant operations in europe  we are particularly exposed to risks resulting from the conversion by certain european union member states of their respective currencies to the euro as legal currency on january  the conversion rates between such european union member states currencies and the euro have been fixed by the european union s council  however  the mandatory switch to the euro will not occur until june  we will be modifying our software during the period of conversion to the euro and intend to complete such work and have our products euro compliant by such time 
risks to us related to the conversion of the euro include 
effects on pricing due to increased cross border price transparency  
costs of modifying information systems  including both software and hardware  
costs of modifying our software products to accommodate euro conversion  
costs of relying upon third parties whose systems also require modification  
changes in the conduct of business  and 
changes in the currency exchange rate 
the actual effects of the euro conversion could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have only limited protection of our proprietary rights and technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of statutory and common law copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  customer licensing agreements  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary rights and technology 
these laws and contractual provisions provide only limited protection 
we have no patents or patent applications pending  no copyrights and only a limited number of registered trademarks 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization or to develop similar technology independently 
also  the laws of certain countries in which we sell our products do not offer as much protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the united states 
unauthorized copying or misuse of our products or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be successful in avoiding claims that we infringe others proprietary rights 
many patents  copyrights and trademarks have been issued in the general areas of information and telecommunications 
we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors providing products and services to the telecommunications industry grows 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights 
infringement claims  with or without merit  could 
result in costly litigation  
require significant management resources  
cause product shipment delays  
require us to enter into unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements  or 
cause us to discontinue the use of the challenged trade name  service mark or technology 
consequently  infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our software may contain undetected errors 
the software that we have developed and licensed to our customers may contain undetected errors 
although we test our software prior to installing it in a customer s network  we may discover errors after the installation 
the cost to fix the errors or to develop the software further could be high 
these errors may subject us to product liability claims 
we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  but we may be subject to such claims in the future 
we have insurance that would cover certain of these claims  however  a successful product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock ownership is highly concentrated 
our executive officers  directors and their affiliates beneficially own approximately million shares approximately of the outstanding common stock 
also  our executive officers and directors and their affiliates hold options to acquire an additional million shares of common stock 
if exercised  these options  taken with the shares owned  would give the directors  officers and their affiliates beneficial ownership of approximately of our common stock 
substantially all such persons and certain other significant stockholders have granted hartmut lademacher the right to vote  through december   all shares of common stock owned by them 
as a result  mr 
lademacher may be able to exert significant influence over the election of directors and the outcome of certain corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
certain measures that we have adopted may have anti takeover effects 
the board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares  without stockholder action 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could discourage or make difficult the acquisition of a majority of our outstanding voting stock by a third party 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws and the delaware general corporation law could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class being elected each year  and directors may only be removed by the affirmative vote of or more of all classes of voting stock 
also  pursuant to our stock incentive plan  all stock options granted to employees automatically vest and become exercisable upon certain triggering events leading up to a change of control 
these factors may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
there may be significant volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
factors such as the following will vary from period to period 
actual or anticipated operating results  
growth rates  
changes in estimates by analysts  
industry conditions  
competitors announcements  
regulatory actions  and 
general economic conditions 
as a result of these and other factors  our operating results from time to time may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
any such event would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
government regulation of our customers could negatively affect us 
currently  our business is not subject to direct government regulation  however  our existing and potential customers are subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions 
regulatory changes which affect our existing and potential customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional shares will become eligible for sale in the future 
the market price of our common stock could drop as a result of sales of large numbers of shares in the market  or the perception that such sales could occur 
several of our principal stockholders hold a significant portion of the outstanding common stock 
we have approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
approximately million of these shares are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the securities act of  except for any shares purchased by our affiliates  as defined in rule under the securities act 
approximately million of the shares of common stock outstanding are restricted securities as defined in rule these shares may be sold in the future without registration under the securities act to the extent permitted by rule or an exemption under the securities act 
in addition  we have registered under the securities act million shares of common stock issuable under our long term incentive plan 
certain of our stockholders are entitled to demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to the shares that they own 
once registered  such shares generally will be eligible for immediate sale in the public market

the words expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements due to a variety of factors  including without limitation those discussed above in factors affecting future performance 
all written or oral forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a significant portion of the company s operations consist of software license sales and software implementation  support and project consulting services in foreign countries  primarily in europe including eastern europe  asia and latin america 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates when the company is paid in foreign currencies and weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company licenses and implements its software products 
the company s operating results are affected by changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the german deutsche mark  swiss franc  and malaysian ringitt 
when the us dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies  the value of our non functional currency revenues decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the value of our functional currency revenues increases 
overall  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  the company benefits from a weaker us dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
however  the company believes that its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk at december  was not material 
the company does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments 
the company also does not purchase for investment  hedging or for purposes other than trading  instruments that are likely to expose it to market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price or equity price risk 
the company has issued no debt instruments  entered into no forward or futures contracts  purchased no options and entered into no swaps 
the company s interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in the us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in us interest rates  the company generally maintains the majority of its investments in fixed rate debt instruments 
because the company has no loans or credit facilities outstanding  it is not exposed to interest rate risk in connection with its operating expenses
