results of operations compared to revenues from continuing operations increased in compared to net income decreased and diluted earnings per share decreased 
the reasons for these changes are described below 
investment services investment services revenues increased in compared to the increase resulted from volatility in world bond markets which caused clients to realign portfolios 
this activity created more transactions and thus more commissions 
also contributing to the increase was the full development of a second office  which opened in revenues at this office increased approximately over investment services expenses increased from of the increase was at the broker dealer and was volume related 
the large increase in revenues resulted in proportionately greater sales commission expense  support personnel expense  transaction charges and financial information services expense 
lower legal fees partially offset these increases 
greater profits in also increased expenses under the incentive compensation plan 
the remainder of the increase in expenses was the result of starting asset management in results in this segment can vary from year to year 
the broker dealer  primarily a provider of fixed income securities  is subject to general market conditions as well as interest rates and is in an industry characterized by competition for top producing brokers 
in an effort to add to the segment s overall profitability  and to add stability from year to year  the company entered the asset management business in as a registered investment advisor  asset management  seeks to manage the portfolios of institutions and high net worth individuals 
asset management is a competitive business and the company cannot say with certainty when or if it will achieve profitability 
insurance services insurance service s revenues decreased in compared to the loss of a large client by the managed insurance company caused most of the variance 
the client purchased extended reporting period or tail coverage  which increased premiums in was lower by both the standard premium and the extra tail premium 
the company s premium based management fee was proportionately lower 
the remainder of the decrease was related to profit sharing 
the insurance management fee contract contains a provision to share in the profits of the managed insurance exchange 
due to the loss of the client mentioned above and an overall increase in competition in medical professional liability insurance in texas  profits  and consequently  profit sharing  were lower in insurance services expenses increased over the increase was in the area of commission expense and was due to the greater utilization of commissioned outside sales agents  compared to salaried internal personnel in prior years 
lower salary expense  primarily due to lower incentive payments  partially offset the increased commissions 
due to the profit sharing provision in this segment s major contract  results can vary from year to year 
in the last five years under the contract  profit sharing has ranged from to of the segment s revenues 
real estate revenue increased compared to the increase reflects higher lease rates  partially offset by a higher vacancy rate 
the increase in real estate expenses resulted from increased property taxes due to higher real estate values 
investment and other the decline in investment and other income was primarily due to lower interest income  a result of available cash being fully invested in new start up companies  which yielded no current return 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased over the increases resulted from recognizing bad debt expense related to the impairment of the con eco note receivable and from expenses related to guaranteeing an individual investor s investment return 
the company had agreed to the guaranteed return to settle a dispute on the customer s account in the portfolio under performed in and additional funds were contributed by the company 
lower management incentive expenses partially offset these increases in interest expense increased from  in to  in the increase reflects funds borrowed under the line of credit to fund the company s investments syntera and uncommon care 
affiliates the company has two affiliates accounted for on the equity basis  prime medical services  inc and syntera healthcare corporation 
prime s operating income increased in but net earnings were reduced by non recurring financing and development costs 
this resulted in a decrease in equity earnings compared to syntera  which was started in  continued in the development phase and reported a loss in the company s share of syntera s loss increased approximately in prime had issued additional shares in reducing the company s ownership from to 
in prime established a stock repurchase plan and reduced its shares outstanding  increasing the company s ownership percentage to approximately 
the company  through its status as prime s largest shareholder and through its representation on prime s board  continues to have significant influence at prime and accounts for its investment using the equity method 
compared to revenues from continuing operations increased in compared to net income increased and diluted earnings per share increased 
the reasons for these changes are described below 
investment services investment services revenues increased in compared to approximately of the increase was attributable to expanding the broker dealer sales force with the opening of an additional office location 
the balance of the increase was primarily a result of lower interest rates creating more activity in the bond market 
investment services expenses increased from the increase reflects increased sales and expanded office operations at the broker dealer with the resultant higher commissions and payroll expense 
better control of legal costs and a lower allocation of corporate overhead partially offset the increases 
insurance services revenues increased as a result of a higher contingent fee  which was based on improved profits at the managed insurance company 
expenses decreased from decreases in legal and professional fees and lower allocated corporate overhead were the significant areas of expense reduction 
real estate revenue decreased compared to the small decrease reflects greater utilization of the office building by the company and affiliates at lower rental rates than outside tenants 
the decrease in real estate expenses in reflects lower corporate overhead allocations 
investment and other the decline in investment and other income was primarily due to lower interest income  the result of the con eco note receivable being on non accrual during all of general and administrative expenses the increase in expenses was a result of changes in accounting estimates rather than fundamental changes in operations 
s expenses reflected favorable adjustments to a contingency provision related to a guarantee  as well as favorable adjustments to allowances for doubtful accounts  a result of collecting the accounts 
no such adjustments were required in interest expense declined primarily due to paying off the company s real estate loan early in affiliates earnings from affiliates increased compared to prime medical continued to grow and did not have the substantial offering and acquisition expenses it incurred in as a result  the company s equity in earnings grew in partially offsetting this increase was a loss in equity earnings of syntera 
syntera was established in and the loss reflects start up and development costs incurred in this early phase 
liquidity and capital resources net working capital was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital reflects the company s cash investment of approximately  in new business opportunities during also reducing working capital was the reclassification of short term notes receivable to long term upon the maker s default on the notes 
historically  the company has maintained a strong working capital position and  using that base  has been able to satisfy its operational and capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from its operating and investing activities 
these same sources of funds have also allowed the company to pursue investment and expansion opportunities consistent with its growth plans 
in  the company entered into a three year  revolving credit agreement with nationsbank of texas  na funds advanced under the agreement bear interest at the prime rate less  such interest to be payable quarterly 
the company will pledge shares of prime medical to the bank as funds are advanced under the line 
no funds had been advanced as of december  at march   had been advanced 
capital expenditures for equipment were   and  in   and  respectively 
in addition  the company improved office space in and for  and  respectively 
the company expects capital expenditures in to be within the range of the prior three years 
the company s ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  its indebtedness  or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated revenue growth  management believes that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under its bank line of credit  will be adequate to meet the company s future liquidity needs for at least the next several years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available under the line of credit in an amount sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs 
inflation the operations of the company are not significantly affected by inflation because  having no manufacturing operations  the company is not required to make large investments in fixed assets 
however  the rate of inflation will affect certain of the company s expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits 
year project the company formed a year committee in mid the committee was charged with examining internal hardware and software systems  physical facilities  and outside suppliers  as these items relate to potential problems that could be caused by the inability to process dates beyond december the committee divided its task into four parts assessment  remediation planning  implementation and testing and contingency planning 
assessment and remediation planning have been completed for all three phases of the project 
implementation and testing and contingency planning are discussed below 
internal hardware and software systems the company has completed substantially all of the needed upgrades to its hardware and software systems 
software testing is expected to be complete by april  and remaining hardware purchases are expected to be complete by june  physical facilities the committee has evaluated its non computer equipment and has determined that  except for its telephone system  there are no devices whose failure would materially affect the ability to carry out the business of the company 
a compliant telephone system is expected to be installed by june  the outside managers of the company s office buildings have reported that all aspects of the physical facilities elevators  fire and security systems  etc 
are compliant 
their further inquiry of those supplying public utilities have produced assurances of best efforts but no guarantee of performance 
outside suppliers the company has inquired about the state of year readiness of those outside suppliers who were determined to be critical to the company s ability to carry out its business 
one services supplier has been identified as being behind in its readiness 
the services are not of an exclusive nature and alternative suppliers are being evaluated 
a switch to an alternative would be made on september  if the current supplier remains non compliant 
contingency planning the company cannot be certain that it has identified and will be successful in bringing into compliance all year issues within its control 
it can be even less certain of critical services being supplied by third parties beyond its control 
upon completion of the testing phase of the plan  the company will formalize plans for carrying on its business in the event of unanticipated year related failures 
presently  the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be a failure of relatively short duration of basic third party services such as the power grid 
with such a failure the company s planning will be directed toward a temporary suspension of operations followed by plans for resumption and catch up operations 
due to the magnitude of the uncertainties related to year issues  the company is unable to fully assess the consequences of year failures and  consequently  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
year costs the company estimates that total expenditures to address year issues will be  of which approximately will be for capitalized hardware purchases 
the remainder of the expenditures are labor costs 
approximately of the expenditures have been made to date 
since the company is in a constant state of upgrading its technology and since all labor costs involve existing in house staff  few of the costs incurred are incremental 
extensive use of in house mis personnel for year issues has delayed implementation of other work designed to improve user productivity and the value of information provided 
the company does not believe such delays will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has some exposure to cash flow and fair value risk from changes in interest rates  which may affect its financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
the company does not use financial instruments for speculative purposes  but does maintain a trading account inventory to facilitate the business of its broker dealer subsidiary 
at the end of the inventory balance was  historically  the company has turned this inventory rapidly and has neither significant realized gains nor losses 
the company has notes receivable  the largest of which is described in item and is currently in default 
the fair value of this defaulted note is determined by collateral and cash flows of the maker and is influenced little  if any  by interest rate changes 
the other notes receivable are in the form of lines of credit to related companies and are at fixed rates 
their fair value will increase and decrease inversely with interest rates 
the company had no debt at december   but has a million line of credit with a floating interest rate 
for each million that the company should borrow in  a increase in interest rate would result in a  annual increase in interest expense
