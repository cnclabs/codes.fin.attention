any material unforeseen increase in expenses or reductions in projected revenues will likely require the company to seek additional debt or equity financing

there can be no assurance that additional capital  on a debt or equity basis  will be found  or if found that it will be on economically viable terms 
year the year issue is the potential for system and processing failures of date related data and the result of computer controlled systems using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
for example  computer programs that have time sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
we could be affected by year issues related to non compliant information technology it systems or non it systems that we operate or that are operated by third parties 
we have substantially completed assessment of our internal and external third party it systems and non it systems 
at this point in our assessment  we are not currently aware of any year problems relating to systems we operate or that are operated by third parties that would have a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition  without taking into account our efforts to avoid such problems 
based on our assessment to date  we do not anticipate that costs associated with remediating our non compliant it systems or non it systems to exceed  although there can be no assurance to such effect  and any such cost will be funded through operating cash flows 
to date the company has incurred no significant costs related to the assessment of  and preliminary efforts in connection with  its year project and the development of a remediation plan 
management does not currently expect the company s financial condition or results of operations will be materially adversely affected by the year issue 
there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
to the extent that our assessment is finalized without identifying any additional material non compliant it systems we operate or that are operated by third parties  the most reasonably likely worst case year scenario is a systemic failure beyond our control  such as a prolonged telecommunications or electrical failure 
such a failure could prevent us from operating our business  prevent users from accessing our web site  or change the behavior of advertising customers or persons accessing our web site 
we believe that the primary business risks  in the event of such failure  would include  but not be limited to  lost advertising revenues  increased operating costs  loss of customers or persons accessing our web site  or other business interruptions of a material nature  as well as claims of mismanagement  misrepresentation  or breach of contract  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have not made any contingency plans to address such risks
