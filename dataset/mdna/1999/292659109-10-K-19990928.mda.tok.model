the company is actively pursuing its strategy to form alliances to commercialize its products 
it is in negotiations with a number of companies which could provide additional license fees to the company in the coming year 
other revenues increased by  or to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  primarily due to increased billings in for work performed for ovonic battery licensees and for additional work performed by ecd s production technology and machine building division 
in  there were certain adjustments which reduced revenues to reflect a change in estimate based on information received by the company pertaining to certain customers and contracts 
the company incurred expenses of   funded and  unfunded in the year ended june  for product development compared to expenses of   funded and  unfunded in the year ended june  the expenditures were primarily for continued development of the company s family of batteries products as well as work performed on the oum program 
the increased expenses of  for product development were offset by the  increase in revenues from product development agreements 
the decrease in cost of product sales to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  was due to the reduced level of battery electrode sales 
while the company has taken significant steps to reduce costs  the low sales volume combined with high fixed costs results in the loss on product sales 
expenses were incurred in and in connection with the protection of ovonic battery s united states patents covering its proprietary technology for nimh batteries 
these expenses were reduced to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  operating  general and administrative expenses increased to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  primarily due to reduced allocations in to cost of revenues from product development agreements  costs associated with a restricted stock grant to one of the company s executives  increased costs associated with stockholder relations and other increased costs in other income of  in the year ended june  compares to other expense of  in the year ended june  the  reduction was due to a  expense versus  in  representing the company s equity in the net loss in its investment in united solar represented as a net loss on the company s financial statements and higher interest expense  partially offset by a  gain on the sale of ovonic battery stock in and higher interest income 
this  expense is related to ecd s cash investments in united solar s future growth 
under gaap  ecd must adjust its investment for its share of the net earnings or losses of united solar for each reporting period until ecd s investment is reduced to zero or exceeds ecd s total cash investment of  at june   regardless of the true value of the investment 
the company does business in many different parts of the world and its royalty revenues are affected by changes in foreign currencies and their exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
however  the vast majority of the company s business agreements are denominated in us dollars and  as such  the company has minimized its exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  the company had a net loss in the year ended june  of  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended june  the loss is primarily due to costs of ongoing battery product development and continued market development  losses related to electrode production as the company optimized its product performance  ongoing protection of the company s technologies and patents  expenses of additional technical  manufacturing and engineering support for gm ovonic in furtherance of nimh battery production and ongoing technical assistance to other customers  and development of oum

ovonyx and ecd are in negotiations with new strategic partners for financing to commercialize its oum 
the company s strategy is to finance its growth through strategic alliances joint ventures and license agreements with third parties who can provide financial resources and marketing expertise for the company s technologies and products 
as a result of the issuance of the basic patents for nimh batteries and phase change optical memory in japan  various new agreements are under discussion 
another important area of the company s development is the use of the company s proprietary hydrogen storage technology for storing  transporting and using hydrogen for a wide range of portable and stationary applications  with vehicles being of prime importance 
in july  ecd and shell hydrogen  a unit of royal dutch shell group  announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding to explore the establishment of a joint venture which would further develop and commercialize the company s proprietary solid hydrogen storage technology 
shell hydrogen will provide refueling and distribution expertise 
during the year ended june    of cash was used in operations 
the difference between the net loss of  and the net cash used in operations was due to ecd s  share of the losses in united solar relating to the company s investment of cash in united solar s future growth  the  gain on the sale of ovonic battery stock  depreciation expense and changes in working capital 
in  ecd invested  in united solar bringing its total investment to  providing funding for new opportunities in the worldwide photovoltaic market served by united solar s unique products which offer particular advantages to the satellite and telecommunications industries 
in addition   of machinery and equipment was purchased or constructed  principally for the company s battery operations during this period 
the company also received  related to the sale of ovonic battery company stock 
the company has had two major electrode customers for its battery electrode products  gp batteries international limited gp batteries and gm ovonic 
gp batteries  a licensee  pays royalties and is currently manufacturing its own electrode products 
the company is developing new electrode materials that are being offered to customers and is adjusting its manufacturing processes for electrodes to customer specifications 
the company expects significant revenues and cash flows related to product development agreements  many of which already exist  that are entered into by the company with us government agencies and with industry partners to develop the company s products and production technology 
in october  ecd was awarded two contracts by the department of energy a cost shared cooperative agreement to develop and demonstrate an integrated system for the production and storage of clean  renewable hydrogen fuel for transportation and other applications in the developing world  and a cost shared contract to develop and demonstrate a high rate thin film deposition process to further reduce photovoltaic manufacturing costs 
revenues under these contracts are recognized as the work is performed 
contracts with industry partners include a program with general motors to develop next generation batteries for electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications which is presently projected to conclude in the fall of three contracts awarded in the fall of to the company under nist advanced technology programs will also contribute to cash flows 
one contract  was awarded to ovonic battery to develop the next generation of high energy density nimh batteries using low cost magnesium based hydrogen storage materials 
the other two nist contracts for  and  were awarded to ecd to support development of a new  low cost manufacturing system for dvd digital versatile disks based on ecd s proprietary phase change optical memory technology and for further development of the phase change optical memory products 
one of these contracts will conclude in the fall of and the other will conclude in the fall of generally  the agreed upon fees for these product development agreements reimburse the company for its direct costs associated with these projects  together with a portion of indirect costs patents  operating  general and administrative expenses and depreciation 
during the next months  the company expects to purchase up to  of machinery and equipment 
in addition to its  investment in may  ecd invested  in united solar during the year ended june  and has advanced an additional  during the period july  to september  the company has a financing arrangement with standard federal bank for a  line of credit bearing an interest rate at prime rate which expires on march  the company does not expect to use any of this available financing during the next months 
the company s strategy is to finance its growth through the formation of strategic alliances to further commercialize its products 
while the company is in negotiations concerning its nimh battery  hydrogen storage  photovoltaic  oum  optical memory and production systems technologies with a number of companies which could provide it with additional revenue under license and other agreements in the coming year  it is unable to predict the amount  if any  of such revenue 
the company is not aware of events or circumstances that would significantly alter royalty revenues for the next months 
in february  ecd received a contract for approximately  to build large area microwave deposition equipment 
this new contract provides the platform for the commercialization of ecd s passive coatings technology and equipment to manufacture products incorporating such technology 
the receipt of this order directly results from the research and development conducted by the company  the costs of which were recorded as losses in prior years 
the contract provides for progress payments over the next months 
through june   ecd has recognized revenues of  in connection with this contract 
machine building is a cyclical but an important part of ecd s business 
while there is no other backlog of machine building contracts as of june   negotiations are in progress with a number of companies for additional machine building contracts that could provide revenues in the coming year and beyond 
based upon the above information  the amount of cash to be received under existing product development agreements in the year ending june  is anticipated to be approximately  compared to  received from product development agreements in the year ended june  based on historical trends  the amount of cash from royalties to be received in the year ending june  is expected to be  approximately  compared to  received in the year ended june  since license agreements are continuously being negotiated  fees from such agreements are difficult to predict 
the company is unable to forecast the amount of cash to be received from license fees in the year ending june  management believes that funds generated from operations  new business agreements and existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to support and finance planned growth  capital expenditures and company sponsored product development programs over the coming year 
additional sources of cash are required to sustain the company for the long term and to build the business in the future 
while it is the company s intent to fund its near term operations from cash and cash equivalent balances on hand and from activities such as product sales  licensing  royalties  product development agreements and strategic alliances  the amount and timing of revenues from such activities are uncertain 
the company is in discussions with third parties to form joint ventures  and to engage in machine building and licensing and may also consider equity or debt financing in order to fund its growth in certain strategic areas 
year issue historically  many computer programs have been written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which could result in the program failing to properly recognize a year that begins with instead of this  in turn  could result in major system failures or miscalculations and is generally referred to as the year issue 
the company formulated a year plan to address the company s year issues 
the company s own internal systems are a primary area of focus 
in july  the company installed a new computer system to help manage its financial  business reporting and data processing software applications 
the providers of the application software used in the new computer system have represented the software to be year compliant 
the company has successfully completed its own evaluation of the software 
the company evaluated its other software applications  including  but not limited to  its computerized laboratory manufacturing equipment and embedded chips  to identify any year issues to ensure that there are no material disruptions in the company s operations 
the company s year plan is to o inventory hardware  software and equipment o test and or confirm hardware  software and equipment considered year compliant o identify year issues o determine necessary measures to address issues o implement remedies o test and confirm the company has completed these steps to a significant degree 
most non compliant software was upgraded from equipment manufacturers and software providers 
the cost of year compliance was less than  and was comprised of the purchase of upgraded software and new or upgraded computers 
if the company s new computer system fails with respect to the year issue or if any applications or embedded chips critical to the company s manufacturing process are overlooked  there could be a material adverse impact on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted  or that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have material adverse effect on the business operations or financial performance of the company 
in particular  if third party providers  due to the year issue  fail to provide the company with components  materials or energy which are necessary to timely complete contractual requirements or to manufacture its products  then any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the business operations and financial performance of the company 
the company believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is that a small number of vendors will be unable to supply components for a short period of time after january  the company is preparing a contingency plan that will address unavoided or unavoidable risks and expects to have the contingency plan in place by october item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable
