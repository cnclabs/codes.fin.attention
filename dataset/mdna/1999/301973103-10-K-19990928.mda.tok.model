item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended june  change change net revenue    net revenue was relatively flat in compared to the increase in net revenue was primarily the result of the company s mobile information management mim product lines  which grew from the increase in revenue from mim products was offset by an decline in revenue from the other products segment  primarily the company s mechanical port replicator product line  which declined form  and a decline in revenue from printing solutions product lines  which declined in as a result of the discontinuance of the mechanical port replicator line  the company recorded product returns and a provision for product returns totaling million in the growth in net revenue for from was principally due to increased unit sales in the port replicator product line  increased unit sales of printing solution and mim products and increased non recurring engineering nre revenue in the mim segment 
the increase was offset by a decline in average selling price of printing solution products 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenue from international sales  principally from its international sales subsidiaries  a limited number of distributors and from original equipment manufacturer oem customers 
in  and  international sales represented  and of net revenue  respectively 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of net revenue in the foreseeable future 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  fluctuation in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulty in staffing and managing international operations and political and economic instability 
several of the company s products  in particular its extendnet print servers  jeteye irda products  infrared software and data synchronization software are sold to oem customers  and the company intends to continue to increase sales to oem customers in the future  particularly with the mim product lines 
in  oem sales of mim products and services to hewlett packard company accounted for of the company s total net revenue 
revenue from oem sales is expected to fluctuate on a quarterly basis  as demand in the oem market is difficult to predict and dependent on the timing of oem projects and the effectiveness of the marketing efforts of oem customers 
the company markets and sells certain of its products through multiple indirect channels  primarily distributors and resellers 
the company supports its indirect channels with its own sales and marketing organization 
the company s largest distributor is ingram micro  inc ingram micro and  in  and  sales to ingram micro accounted for  and of the company s net revenue  respectively 
sales to another distributor  tech data corporation  accounted for of the company s net revenue in sales to both distributors were primarily for printing solutions products and port replicator products 
the company provides price protection rights and limited product return rights for stock rotation to most of its distributors and resellers 
the company s distributors maintain inventory of the company s products 
changes in inventory management policies at any of the company s key distributors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the loss of  or reduction in sales to  any of the company s key customers could have a material adverse affect on the company s business and results of operations 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
the company s future success will depend  to a substantial degree  upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and emerging and evolving industry standards 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires the company to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  to avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and to ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop  introduce or manage the transition to new products 
the company seeks to mitigate the effects of declining prices on hardware products by improving product design and reducing costs  primarily manufacturing and component costs 
year ended june  change change gross profit    gross margin the decrease in the company s gross margin in from was primarily the result of an increase in unit sales of lower margin mim hardware products and a shift in product mix in the printing solutions segment to lower priced and lower margin products 
the decrease in gross margin was also the result of the increase in the allowance for port replicator returns of million and an increase in the inventory valuation allowance for port replicators of million 
the decrease was offset by increased royalty  license and nre revenue in the mim group and increased sales of mim software products 
the decrease in gross margin for from was principally due to a shift in product mix 
sales of port replicator products and certain mim hardware products  which have a lower relative gross margin  were a higher percentage of sales in as compared to this decrease was offset in part by strong royalty  license and nre revenue in the mim group 
the company s cost of net revenue consists primarily of costs associated with components  out sourced manufacturing of certain subassemblies  and in house labor associated with assembly  testing  shipping and quality assurance 
the company s gross margin is affected by a number of factors  including product mix  competitive product pricing pressures  manufacturing costs  component costs  provisions for obsolete inventory and warranty costs 
the company anticipates that its gross margin may continue to decline in the future as a result of shifts in the company s product mix and competitive pricing pressure 
in particular  the company expects that its gross margin for printing solutions products may continue to decline as a result of a continued shift in product mix toward lower priced products 
the company also expects that gross margin from the mim segment will fluctuate due to shifts in mix between hardware and software products and the timing of nre revenue 
year ended june  change change research and development    as a of net revenue the increase in research and development expenses for fiscal from the prior year was principally due to increased personnel costs in the mim segment primarily as a result of the company s acquisitions of rand software corporation rand in october and parallax research  ltd 
parallax in november the increase was partially offset by reduced personnel costs in the printing solutions segment and the other products segment 
the increase in research and development expense for from was principally due to increased personnel costs associated with development of the mim product lines 
the company expects research and development expense to continue to increase in the future  although such expense may vary as a percentage of net revenue 
year ended june  change change marketing and sales    as a of net revenue the increase in marketing and sales expenses for from the prior year was primarily due to increased personnel costs and promotional activities for the mim product lines both domestically and at the company s european subsidiaries 
the increases were partially offset by decreased promotional activities associated with printing solutions product lines and the port replicator product line 
the increase in marketing and sales expenses for from was principally due to increased promotional activities associated with the mim product lines and the port replicator product line  offset by decreased activity for the company s printing solutions product lines 
the company expects marketing and sales expense to continue to increase in the future  although such expense may vary as a percentage of net revenue 
year ended june  change change general and administrative    as a of net revenue the increase in general and administrative expense for from the prior year was primarily attributable to increased professional services expense  primarily as a result of being a publicly traded company  and administrative expenses in the mim group subsequent to the acquisition of parallax 
the increase was offset by a decrease in compensation expense associated with stock options 
the increase in from was principally due to increased administrative expenses at the company s subsidiaries  increased stock option compensation expense in all segments  and increased fees for professional services  some of which are attributable to being a public company 
the company expects general and administrative expense to continue to increase in the future  although such expense may vary as a percentage of net revenue 
year ended june  change change income tax provision benefit   as a of income loss before taxes the change in the income tax provision or benefit for as compared to was primarily due to a net loss before income taxes for the change in the estimated effective tax rate is primarily the result of non deductible expenses associated with the rand and parallax acquisitions  acquired in process research and development expenses and amortization of intangibles 
the increase in the income tax provision in as compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher income before taxes 
results of operations by segment the company s product offerings are classified into three segments  the printing solutions segment  the mobile information management segment and the other products segment 
the discussion below addresses the operating results attributable to each of the three product segments 
printing solutions segment the printing solutions segment includes the company s maturing network print server and non network printer sharing product lines  sold primarily through the company s worldwide distribution channel to computer resellers and fortune companies 
although the printing solutions business is not the primary focus of the company s research and development or marketing strategies in the future  the company intends to continue to keep the product line up to date by adding technology enhancements including fiber and mobile connectivity options 
year ended june  change change net revenue    income from operations    the decrease in net revenue for from the prior year was principally due to decreased unit sales of both non networked printer sharing products and network print server products coupled with a decrease in the average selling prices caused by a shift in product mix to lower priced products 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in unit sales of oem print servers  at a slightly lower average selling price than in the prior year 
the increase in net revenue in from was due primarily to increased unit sales of extendnet print servers  offset by a decline in the average selling price of extendnet print servers due to higher sales of lower priced print servers 
the increase was also offset by a decline in print server royalty revenue and a decline in unit sales of non network printer sharing products 
in  and   and  respectively  of the company s total net revenue was derived from sales of the company s network print server products 
the company expects that both unit sales and average selling prices of both network print server and non network printer sharing products may decline in the future 
it also expects that total printing solutions net revenue will decline as a percentage of the company s net revenue as the company s mobile information management product lines achieve increased market acceptance 
income from operations from the printing solutions segment decreased in from primarily due to decreased gross margins from both network print server and non network printer sharing products as the company experienced a shift in product mix to lower gross margin products 
the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses as the company shifts resources to support the mim product lines 
the increase in income from operations in from the prior year reflects flat gross profit from year to year and a decrease in operating expenses 
mobile information management segment the company s mobile information management segment includes both universal mobile connectivity and mobile data management solutions that enable mobile users to access  synchronize  collect  and retrieve information on demand 
the company s products in the mim segment include wireless connectivity products  data synchronization software  virtual private network remote access servers  internet access servers and database management systems with remote access capabilities 
year ended june  change change net revenue    loss from operations net revenue from the mim product lines in grew from the prior year and grew to of the company s total net revenue in  up from in the increase was due primarily to increased unit sales of oem hardware products and the internet access products  and increased license revenue for advantage database server products 
the increase in revenue in from was the result of increased royalty  license and nre revenue and increased unit sales of extendnet vpn and extendnet ias products  which were introduced in october  and increased revenue from north american sales of advantage database server products 
this increase was partially offset by decreased international sales of advantage database server products 
the company believes that net revenue from mim products will continue to become a larger percentage of total net revenue as the company continues to focus on mobile information management product lines and as mim products continue to achieve increased market acceptance 
the company s future results of operations will be highly dependent upon the success of recently introduced products and the success of the company s recent acquisitions 
mim products are sold primarily to oem customers  application developers and computer resellers both directly and through the company s ecommerce storefronts on the internet 
the company expects to increase sales to oem customers in the future  however  sales to oem customers are hard to predict and are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the timing of the closure of oem business and the effectiveness of oem customers marketing efforts 
the loss from operations for the mim segment decreased from to primarily as a result of increased gross profit from mim products 
this increase in gross profit was offset by a significant increase in the company s spending for mim research and development projects for both the wireless connectivity hardware and software products and acquired in process research and development charges of  from the company s acquisitions 
the company also increased its spending in marketing and sales for all mim products both domestically and internationally 
other products segment the primary component of the company s other products segment has been the company s mechanical port replicator product line 
in december  the company announced its decision to exit the mechanical port replicator business 
the company s decision was based on two primary factors 
the company saw a decrease in demand for third party port replicator products as laptop vendors became more successful in providing similar products in a more timely manner 
in addition  the company was experiencing quality related problems with its supplier and  consequently  faced a lack of a reliable source for port replicators to support future releases of laptop pc models in the increasingly competitive environment 
year ended june  change change net revenue  loss from operations   the decrease in net revenue in from was principally due to decreased unit sales and average selling prices of port replicator products 
net revenue for included product returns and a provision for product returns totaling million as a result of the decision to exit the mechanical port replicator business 
the increase in net revenue in over was due to an increase in unit sales of port replicator products  which were introduced in february the loss from operations for the company s other products reflects decreased gross profit and gross margin from the port replicator product line and includes the port replicator returns and provision for port replicator returns totaling million and an increase in the provision for write down of port replicator inventory of million 
business combinations in october  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of rand software corporation for  in cash and  shares of common stock valued at  in november  the company acquired a controlling interest in parallax research  pte 
for  in cash and by assuming  in debt 
in may  acquired the remaining outstanding stock of parallax for  in cash 
these transactions were accounted for by the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations apb  and  accordingly  the results of operations of both companies have been included in the consolidated statement of operations since the acquisition dates 
rand is the developer of harmony  a data synchronization software for mobile devices such as windows ce handheld pcs and palm size computers 
this synchronization technology allows mobile devices to update and exchange data with enterprise applications such as microsoft exchange  microsoft outlook  lotus notes and symantec act 
parallax develops infrared connectivity products primarily for sale to oem customers and manages the company s relationships with its manufacturers in asia 
a summary of the total net assets acquired at the date of the acquisitions  as determined in accordance with apb is as follows net working capital property and equipment developed technology  goodwill and other intangibles  acquired in process research and development the valuation of the intangible assets acquired from rand and parallax  including the acquired in process research and development  developed technology and goodwill  was determined by independent appraisers 
management  based upon such independent appraisals  estimated that  in aggregate  the fair value of acquired in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use was  the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development was expensed as a charge to operations in the second quarter of such appraisers determined the value assigned to acquired in process research and development by projecting net cash flows related to future products expected to result from commercialization of the acquired in process research and development 
the net cash flows from such projects were based on estimates made by the company s management 
projected net revenue included the expected evolution of the technology and the reliance of future technologies on the in process technologies over time  but excluded amounts expected to result from existing products and technologies 
management based the estimated cost of sales and estimated operating expenses on the company s cost structure and that of comparable companies 
the net cash flows were adjusted for the stage of completion of the projects and discounted to their present values based on risk adjusted discount rates of to 
the discount rates were based on various factors such as lack of operating history  aggressive projections for certain products  reliance on oem customers  management depth and product diversification 
rand s research and development in process on the date of the acquisition related to a server based data synchronization software product that was estimated to be approximately complete and would require an estimated  and man months of time to complete 
development in process at the time of the acquisition of rand was subsequently utilized to develop a web based synchronization product and will continue to be incorporated into additional mim products  including products complementary to the server based product acquired with asl in august the company used acquired in process research and development from parallax to develop new products using the developing fast ir technology standard 
a product being developed for an oem customer  to be used in a printer based product  accounted for a substantial majority of the acquired in process research and development from parallax 
all projects in process at the time of the acquisition were completed in at an estimated cost of  on august   the company completed an acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of oval limited oval pursuant to an acquisition agreement  dated as of august  oval  based in bristol  england  is the parent company of advance systems limited 
asl  a developer of server based synchronization software for portable computing devices and high end cellular phones  and zebedee software limited  a software consulting company 
as consideration in the acquisition  the shareholders of oval will receive million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
the total purchase price is valued at approximately million  including acquisition expenses 
for accounting purposes  the acquisition will be treated as a purchase 
the company expects that substantially all of the purchase price in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired will be allocated to developed technology and acquired in process research and development 
developed technology will be amortized over the expected life of the technology and acquired in process research and development will be expensed in the first fiscal quarter of liquidity  capital resources and financial condition year ended june  change net cash provided used by operating activities  historically  the company has funded its operations primarily through cash generated from operations 
the net cash used in operations in was primarily a result of an increase in receivables 
accounts receivable increased to million at the end of from million at the end of the increase was primarily due to increased levels of business 
days sales outstanding dso in receivables were days at the end of and days at the end of the increase in dso was a result of increased receivables from oem and international customers  which typically have longer terms 
the company expects that accounts receivable will increase as net revenue increases and as net revenue from oem and international customers represent a higher percentage of the company s total revenue 
year ended june  change net cash used by investing activities   net cash used by investing activities in consisted largely of net purchases of available for sale securities and cash payments for the acquisitions of rand and parallax 
capital expenditures in were primarily for the enhancement of internal information systems and equipment and related software associated with increased staffing 
the company currently plans to incur aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million during  primarily for system improvements  leasehold improvements  software and personal computers 
year ended june  change net cash provided by financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities for consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of stock from employee stock plans 
net cash provided by financing activities for primarily related to proceeds from the company s initial public offering  which became effective in march see long term debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s convertible debt and available sources of financing 
the company believes that its existing working capital and borrowing capacity  coupled with the funds generated from the company s operations  will be sufficient to fund its acquisition  anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt payment requirements through  including cash requirements for the oval acquisition and million for the payoff of the long term debt to summit in september in the longer term  the company may require additional sources of liquidity to fund future growth 
such sources of liquidity may include additional equity offerings or debt financing 
in addition to the rand and parallax acquisitions in and the oval asl acquisition in the first fiscal quarter of  the company intends to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of  or strategic investments in  companies with complementary products  technologies or distribution networks in order to broaden its product lines and to provide more complete mobile information management product offerings 
the company has no additional commitments or agreements with respect to any such transaction  however  the company may acquire businesses  products or technologies in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not require additional financing in the future or  if the company were required to obtain additional financing in the future  that sources of capital will be available on terms favorable to the company  if at all 
effects of foreign currency exchange rates the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from international sales  principally through its international subsidiaries and through a limited number of independent distributors 
sales made by the company s international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the foreign country s currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies could materially affect the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
from time to time  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the euro and british pound to hedge payments and receipts of foreign currencies related to the purchase and sale of goods to international subsidiaries 
there were no such contracts in place at june  and contracts purchased or sold to date have not been significant 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
to the extent that the company implements hedging activities in the future with respect to foreign currency transactions  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in such hedging activities 
the company has not experienced significant costs as a result of the introduction of a european single currency the euro introduced on january  at an appropriate point before the end of the transition period  december   product prices in participating countries will be denominated in the euro and converted to local denominations 
during the transition period  the company s financial systems located in the participating countries will be converted from local denominations to the euro 
the company does not presently expect that the transition to the euro will materially affect the company s foreign currency exchange and hedging activities 
further  the company does not expect that the transition to the euro will result in any material increase in costs to the company and all costs associated with the transition to the euro will be expensed to operations as incurred 
while the company will continue to evaluate the impact of the transition of the euro  based on currently available information  the company does not believe that the introduction of the euro will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit year entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
to address such year issues  the company established a year project team which is currently in phase four of its five phase plan to assess the company s year compliance 
in prior phases  the company identified three key areas critical to successful year compliance products  financial and information systems and third party relationships 
the company has successfully completed testing of current products and products under development and does not believe there is significant risk of noncompliance 
there can be no assurance that certain previous releases of the company s products  which are no longer under support  will prove to be year compliant 
further information about the company s products is available on its year internet website at www 
extendedsystems 
com 
the company has completed initial evaluation  analysis and testing of its core internal systems and the company does not currently expect any significant issues to be identified during further review  however  further inquiry and review is expected to continue throughout calendar and the failure of the company to correct any issues with internal systems could result in material disruption to the company s operations 
the company has completed its initial assessment of the readiness of third parties with which the company has business relationships  including significant vendors and customers 
the assessment of the compliance of third parties is on going and is also expected to continue throughout calendar and even where assurances are received from third parties there remains a risk that failure of systems and products of other companies on which the company relies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
contingency plans will be developed if it appears that the company or its key suppliers will not be year compliant and if such noncompliance is expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
based on the work done to date  the company has not incurred material costs and does not expect to incur future material costs to address the year problem for its systems and products 
at this time  the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows if internal systems are found to be noncompliant or if key suppliers  customers and other business partners do not become year compliant on a timely basis 
because many companies may need to upgrade or replace computer systems and software to comply with year requirements  the company believes that the purchasing patterns of customers and potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to upgrade their current software systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products such as those offered by the company  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
the foregoing statements are based upon management s best estimates at the present time  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected programs  the rate and magnitude of related labor and consulting costs and the success of the company s external customers and suppliers in addressing the year issue 
the company s evaluation is on going and it expects different information will become available to it as that evaluation continues 
consequently  there is no guarantee that all material elements will be year ready in time 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock in addition to the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  the following are important factors  which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future on a quarterly and an annual basis 
prior growth rates that the company has experienced in net revenue and net income should not be considered indicative of future growth rates 
factors that could cause the company s future operating results to fluctuate include the level of demand for the company s products  the company s success in developing new products  the timing of new product introductions and product enhancements by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of the company s new and enhanced products and oem customers products  the emergence of new industry standards  the timing of customer orders  the mix of products sold  discontinuation of product offerings by the company or its suppliers  competition  the mix of distribution channels through which the company s products are sold and general economic conditions 
many of such factors are beyond the company s control 
in this regard  in the second quarter of fiscal  the company discontinued its mechanical port replicator product line and  as a result  recorded million in total charges for product returns  an allowance for product returns and an increase in the inventory valuation allowance for port replicators 
the company typically operates with a relatively small order backlog 
as a result  quarterly sales and operating results depend in large part on the volume and timing of orders received within the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
significant portions of the company s expenses are fixed in advance  based in large part on the company s forecast of future revenue 
if revenue is below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on the company s operating results may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
therefore  a shortfall in actual revenue as compared to estimated revenue could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
a substantial majority of the company s net revenue results from the sale of products to oem customers and distributors  which sales are difficult to predict and may have lower margins than sales through other channels 
sales through such channels may contribute to increased fluctuations in operating results 
a significant portion of the company s revenue in any quarter is typically derived from sales to a limited number of oem customers and distributors 
any significant deferral of purchases of the company s products by its distributors or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows in any particular period 
the company has experienced some degree of seasonality of net revenue  and the company expects to continue to experience seasonality in the future 
net revenue in the first fiscal quarter typically is lower than net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter  reflecting lower sales in europe and certain other regions in the summer months when business activities are reduced 
as a result of the foregoing factors  the company s operating results may be subject to significant volatility 
it is likely that in a future period the company will fail to achieve anticipated operating results 
any shortfall in net revenue  gross profit or net income from levels expected by securities analysts in any period could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock 
dependence on recently introduced products 
the company s future results of operations will be highly dependent upon the success of recently introduced products  including enterprise harmony data synchronization software  the extendnet internet appliance  counterpoint test tools  advantage database server version with streamline sql  and the server based synchronization product purchased with the acquisition of asl in august newly introduced products are subject to a number of risks  including failure to achieve market acceptance and poor product performance 
the company is unable to predict with any degree of certainty the rate of market acceptance of these newly introduced products 
no assurance can be given that any of such products will not require additional development work  enhancement  testing or refinement before they achieve market acceptance 
if such new and recently introduced products have performance  reliability  quality or other shortcomings  then such products could fail to achieve market acceptance and the company may experience reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional warranty and service expenses  which in each case could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
risks associated with new and evolving markets 
the markets for universal mobile connectivity and mobile data management are still emerging  and there can be no assurance that they will continue to grow or that  even if the markets grow  the company s products that address these markets will be successful 
the company s success in generating significant revenue in these evolving markets will depend upon  among other things  its ability to demonstrate the benefits of its technology to potential distributors  oem customers and end users  to maintain and enhance its relationships with leading distributors and to expand successfully its distribution channels 
the success of the company s infrared and data synchronization products will rely  to a large degree  on the increased use of mobile devices including cellular phones and other handheld organizers and devices 
the success of the and extendnet internet appliance and extendnet vpn products will rely  to a large degree  on the increased use of the internet by businesses as replacements for  or enhancements to  their private networks 
there can be no assurance that businesses will develop sufficient confidence in the internet to deploy the company s products to a significant degree 
the inability of the company to continue to penetrate the existing markets for universal mobile connectivity and mobile data management solutions or the failure of current markets to grow or new markets to develop or be receptive to the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
the emergence of markets for the company s products will be affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control 
for example  the company s products are designed to conform to certain standard infrared and networking specifications 
there can be no assurance that these specifications will be widely adopted or that competing specifications will not emerge which will be preferred by the company s customers 
in addition  there can be no assurance that infrared technology itself will be adopted as the standard or preferred technology for wireless connectivity or that manufacturers of personal computers will elect to bundle the infrared technology in their products 
the emergence of markets for the company s products is critically dependent upon continued expansion of the market for mobile computing devices and the timely introduction and successful marketing and sale of mobile computing products such as notebook computers and personal digital assistants  of which there can be no assurance 
product concentration 
the company believes that  in the near term  the extendnet print server product line will continue to account for a significant portion of the company s net revenue and gross profit 
the company expects that its gross margin on sales of extendnet print servers will continue to decline as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower priced print servers and competitive pricing pressures 
the company s future operating results  particularly in the near term  are dependent upon the continued market acceptance of extendnet print servers 
there can be no assurance that extendnet print servers will continue to meet with market acceptance or that the company will be successful in developing  introducing or marketing new or enhanced products 
a decline in the demand for extendnet print servers  as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  or the failure to successfully develop  introduce or market new or enhanced products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
the life cycle of extendnet print servers is difficult to estimate because of  among other factors  the presence of strong competitors in the market and the likelihood of future competition 
reliance on distribution channels 
the company sells certain of its products  primarily its printing solutions products  domestically and internationally  primarily to distributors and resellers and  to a lesser extent  to oem customers 
the company s success depends on the continued sales efforts of its network of distributors and resellers 
the loss of  or reduction in sales to  any of the company s key customers could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
the company provides most of its distributors and resellers with limited product return rights for stock rotation 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience significant returns in the future or that it will have made adequate allowances to offset such returns 
the company also provides most of its distributors and resellers with price protection rights 
price protection rights require that the company grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of the company s products held by distributors or resellers if the company lowers its prices for such products 
the short life cycles of the company s products and the difficulty in predicting future sales increase the risk that new product introductions  price reductions by the company or its competitors or other factors affecting the markets in which the company competes could result in significant product returns 
in addition  new product introductions by competitors or other market factors could require the company to reduce prices in a manner or at a time which has a material adverse impact upon the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
the company intends to continue to enhance and diversify its international and domestic distribution channels 
none of the company s distributors or oem customers is obligated to purchase the company s products except pursuant to current purchase orders 
the company s ability to achieve future revenue growth will depend in large part on its success in recruiting and training sufficient sales personnel  distributors  vars and oem customers 
certain of the company s existing distributors currently distribute  or may in the future distribute  the product lines of the company s competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract  train and retain a sufficient number of its existing or future third party distributors or direct sales personnel  that such third party distributors will recommend  or continue to recommend  the company s products or that the company s distributors will devote sufficient resources to market and provide the necessary customer support for such products 
sales to oem customers involve a number of potential risks  including lengthy sales cycles  potential competition from oem customers and effectiveness of the marketing efforts of oem customers 
the company s oem customers may in the future incorporate competing products into their systems or internally develop competing solutions 
in the event that the company s oem customers reduce their purchases of the company s products  the company s future growth would be adversely affected 
all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
competition 
the markets for the company s products are intensely competitive  and are characterized by frequent new product introductions  rapidly changing technology and standards  constant price pressure and competition for distribution channels 
the principal competitive factors in the company s markets include product performance  reliability  price  breadth of product line  sales and distribution capability and technical support and service 
certain of these factors are outside the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future with respect to these or any other competitive factors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
see business competition 
risks of international sales and operations 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenue from international sales  principally through its international sales subsidiaries and a limited number of distributors 
the company expects that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of its net revenue for the foreseeable future 
if any significant international distributor were to cease purchasing products or were to significantly reduce its orders from the company for any reason  the company s business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
international sales are subject to a number of risks  including changes in government regulations  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulty in staffing and managing international operations  political and economic instability  including instability caused by the european monetary union and military actions 
many of such factors are beyond the company s control 
a substantial portion of the company s international sales are typically denominated in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause the company s products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
transactions made through the company s subsidiary in singapore are primarily denominated in us dollars 
the transactions made through the company s subsidiaries in france  germany  italy  the united kingdom and the netherlands are primarily denominated in local currencies and  accordingly  the company s international operations impose a risk upon its business as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the united states 
there can be no assurance that foreign markets will continue to develop or that the company will receive additional orders to supply its products for use in foreign markets 
risks associated with new product development 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
the company s future success will depend to a substantial degree upon its ability to enhance its existing products and to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and emerging and evolving industry standards 
the company budgets research and development expenses based on planned product introductions and enhancements  however  actual expenses may differ significantly from budget 
the product development process involves a number of risks 
the development of new  technologically advanced hardware and software products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires the company to manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  to avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and to ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
for example  in august the company released the extendnet  its next generation internet appliance product  which replaces the extendnet ias product 
as a result  the company may be required to reduce the carrying value of extendnet ias product currently in inventory if the market adopts the extendnet faster than the company anticipated 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop  introduce or manage the transition to new products 
the company has in the past experienced  and is likely in the future to experience  delays in the introduction of new products  due to factors internal and external to the company 
any future delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  the inability of such products to achieve market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
risks associated with third party manufacturers and suppliers 
the company s future success will depend  in significant part  on its ability to continue to have third parties manufacture its products successfully  cost effectively and in sufficient volumes to meet customer demand 
the company maintains a limited in house manufacturing capability for performing materials procurement  final assembly  testing  quality assurance and shipping 
the company relies primarily on independent subcontractors to manufacture its products  and the company intends to increase its reliance upon third party manufacturers in the future 
certain of the company s products are manufactured in their entirety by third parties 
for example  apexx technology  inc manufactured the company s first internet access product  the extendnet ias 
is manufactured by apexx technology  inc the reliance on third party manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of existing and new products and reduced control over delivery schedules  product quality and product cost 
in this regard  in december  the company announced its decision to exit the port replicator business due  in part  to quality problems associated with the sole supplier of this product 
the decision to exit the port replicator business was the primary cause of the decline in the company s net revenue in the second fiscal quarter ended december  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience similar problems in the future should the company rely on other third party suppliers 
in the event that the company is unable to maintain good relationships with its third party manufacturers there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
from time to time the company has agreed with certain suppliers that the company will purchase certain components exclusively from such suppliers 
because the manufacturing of the company s products can involve long lead times  in the event of unanticipated increases in demand for the company s products  the company could be unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet its customers demands 
the company also relies on third party suppliers for components used in its products 
certain of the components used in the company s products  including certain semiconductor components and infrared transmission components  are currently available from a limited number of suppliers 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or other circumstances that would require the company to seek alternative manufacturers could affect the company s ability to ship its products on a timely basis  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and end users and could therefore have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
dependence on licensed technology 
the company licenses technology on a non exclusive basis from several companies for use with its products and anticipates that it will continue to do so in the future 
the inability of the company to continue to license this technology or to license other necessary technology for use with its products  or substantial increases in royalty payments pursuant to third party licenses  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the effective implementation of the company s products depends upon the successful operation of this licensed software in conjunction with the company s products  and therefore any undetected errors in products resulting from such software may prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of the company s products  delay new product introductions and injure the company s reputation 
such problems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
product errors  product liability 
software and hardware products as complex as those offered by the company typically contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
testing of the company s products is particularly challenging because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments in which the company s customers may deploy these products 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found after commencement of commercial shipments 
any such errors  or bugs  could result in dissatisfied customers and the loss of or delay in market acceptance of the new product  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
although to date the company has not experienced any material product liability claims  there can be no assurance that the company will not face material product liability claims in the future 
a successful product liability claim brought against the company could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
management of growth 
any future growth experienced by the company is likely to place a significant strain on the company s administrative  operational and financial resources and to increase demands on the company s systems and controls 
future growth may also result in an increase in the scope of responsibility for management personnel 
the company anticipates that growth and expansion will require it to recruit  hire  train and retain a substantial number of new engineering  executive  sales and marketing personnel 
as is the case with many technology companies  in the current employment environment the company has experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel  and continued difficulty in this regard could limit the company s ability to grow 
in order to manage its growth successfully  the company will continue to expand and improve its operational  management and financial systems and controls 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully implement such systems and controls on a timely basis 
if the company s management is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s business  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
risks associated with acquisitions by the company 
as part of its growth strategy  the company intends to continue to pursue the acquisition of companies that either complement or expand its existing business  as the company did with its acquisitions of rand  in october  and parallax  in november  and asl  in august the company is continually evaluating potential acquisition opportunities  which may be material in size and scope 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and difficulties  including the expansion into new markets and business areas  the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the integration of the acquired companies management information systems with those of the company  potential adverse short term effects on the company s operating results  the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the need to present a unified corporate image 
in addition  acquisitions could result in the need to expend substantial amounts of cash 
while the company believes that it has sufficient funds to finance its operations for at least the next months  to the extent that such funds are insufficient to fund the company s activities  including any potential acquisitions  the company may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt may result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the company s common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing will be available or that  if available  it can be obtained on terms favorable to the company or its shareholders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in identifying acquisition candidates  that the company will have adequate resources to consummate any acquisition  that any acquisition by the company will or will not occur  that if any acquisition does occur it will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows or that any such acquisition will be successful in enhancing the company s business 
proprietary rights and risks of infringement 
there can be no assurance that any patent  trademark or copyright owned by the company will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company or that any of the company s pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by the company  if at all 
further  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to the company s technology  duplicate the company s technology or design around the patents owned by the company 
effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company will prevent misappropriation of its technology by foreign companies 
if the company were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party  the company could be subject to liabilities for such infringement  which could be material 
as a result  the company could be required to seek licenses from other companies or to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling certain products or using certain processes 
although holders of patents and other intellectual property rights often offer licenses to their patent or other intellectual property rights  no assurance can be given that licenses would be offered  that the terms of any offered license would be acceptable to the company or that the failure to obtain a license would not adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
in order to protect its proprietary rights  the company may in the future initiate proceedings against third parties 
any litigation  whether brought by or against the company  could result in the incurrence of significant expenses by the company 
in addition  any such litigation could result in a diversion of management s time and efforts 
a claim by the company against a third party could prompt a counterclaim by the third party against the company  which could have an adverse effect on the company s intellectual property rights 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s future success will depend to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of its key management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel 
the company does not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
the loss of key management or technical personnel could adversely affect the company 
the company believes that its future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel 
in particular  the company is currently attempting to recruit new engineering personnel  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful at hiring or retaining these personnel 
failure to recruit  hire  train and retain key personnel would limit future growth and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and cash flows 
stock price volatility 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the computer industry  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent months 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons that may be unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company s liquid investments are at fixed interest rates and  therefore  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
a significant portion of the company s liquid investments mature within days or less of june   therefore  the company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of liquid investments is minimal 
all of the company s long term debt is at fixed interest rates and  therefore  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
because substantially all of the company s long term debt is due on september   the company believes that the market risk arising from its long term debt is minimal 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from international sales  principally through its international subsidiaries in france  germany  italy  singapore  the united kingdom and the netherlands  and through a limited number of oem customers and independent distributors  therefore  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
sales made by the company s foreign subsidiaries are generally denominated in the foreign country s currency with the exception of the company s subsidiary in singapore 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and other foreign currencies could materially affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
from time to time  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts  typically against the euro and british pound to hedge payments and receipts of foreign currencies related to the purchase and sale of goods to international subsidiaries 
there were no such contracts in place at june  and contracts purchased or sold to date have not been significant 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the success of these hedging activities depends upon estimation of intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses
