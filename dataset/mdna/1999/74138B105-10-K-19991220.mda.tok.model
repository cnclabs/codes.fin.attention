the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report 
fluctuations in annual and quarterly results may occur as a result of factors affecting demand for the company s products such as the timing of the company s and competitors new product introductions and upgrades 
due to such fluctuations  historical results and percentage relationships are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
in addition  the company believes that certain individuals and entities that traditionally buy software from both the company and others are deferring purchases of software in the fourth quarter of the calendar year due to concern over the year issue  which is expected to adversely impact the company s financial results 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the company s results of operations and the percentage relationship of certain items to revenues during the periods shown 
unless otherwise indicated  references to years are to fiscal years which ended september revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring operating income loss interest income income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income loss revenues revenues decreased by to million in fiscal compared to  and by to million in fiscal compared to when revenues were million 
the decrease in fiscal revenues from those of is due to lower revenues received from royalties received related to licenses of stac s data compression technology to operating system vendors 
the decrease in fiscal revenues from those of is also due primarily to lower revenues received from these royalties 
there were no royalty revenues in fiscal  million in and million in in and these royalty revenues were solely from agreements with microsoft and ibm  who were obligated to continue making payments under the licenses at the rate of million per quarter through december  with a final payment of million in the march quarter 
the company did not receive any royalty payments in fiscal and expects no further royalty revenues under these agreements with microsoft and ibm 
software sales declined from fiscal to and from fiscal to those decreases are discussed below

these declines were partially offset by increased sales of replica tape  primarily due to higher oem revenues 
international revenues  which are included above  were million  or of revenues in fiscal  million or of revenues in and million  or of revenues in the increase in international revenues from fiscal to is primarily due to increased european sales related to an oem agreement with a large computer manufacturer in the united kingdom

stac markets and sells to its european accounts from its office in the united kingdom and markets and sells primarily to japan and australia through relationships with distributors and resellers abroad 
gross margin cost of revenues consists primarily of the user manuals  packaging  media and assembly associated with the company s software products 
gross margins were in fiscal and in and the decrease in gross margins from fiscal to is due to the elimination of royalty revenues  which carry gross margin 
research and development the cost of product development consists primarily of salaries  employee benefits  overhead and outside contractors 
such expenses were million in fiscal  million for and million for the decrease in product development costs from fiscal to is primarily due to lower product localization costs and lower employee and consulting costs  related to the reallocation of resources among development facilities in conjunction with the restructuring discussed below 
the decrease in product development in fiscal from is due to a decreased level of activity in development of reachout  consistent with its mature phase in its life cycle 
the decrease in reachout development spending has been partially offset by increased spending related to development of the replica product line 
the increase in product development expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the company s lower revenues in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal as compared to the company expects to continue to invest in the development of products for which it believes there is a need in the market  however  there can be no assurance that product development programs invested in by the company will be successful or that products resulting from such programs will achieve market acceptance 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits of sales  marketing and customer support personnel  and consulting  advertising  promotional and overhead expenses 
such expenses were million fiscal  million for and million for the decrease in marketing and sales expense in fiscal from and in fiscal from that in was due to corporate restructurings of these functional areas 
the restructurings refocused sales and marketing efforts towards developing corporate enterprise customers  rather than individual end users 
the increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the company s lower revenues in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal as compared to sales and marketing expenses are expected to remain the company s most significant ongoing operating expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of salaries for administrative and corporate services personnel  legal and other professional fees 
such expenses were million for fiscal  million for and million for the reduction in spending from to reflects lower management costs and non recurring costs associated with stac s spin off of its former hi fn subsidiary 
the decrease in fiscal expenses compared to those in was primarily due to the conclusion of an outside strategic assessment review conducted in and charged to fiscal expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the company s lower revenues in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal as compared to restructuring charges as discussed above  in fiscal  the company reorganized its sales and marketing departments and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the principal components of the charge were losses on property and equipment abandonments million  severance and employee related liabilities million  lease termination costs million and consulting and outplacement related to the terminated employees million 
in fiscal  the company incurred an additional million related to the above mentioned restructuring 
this additional amount represented severance and employee related liabilities which the company was not permitted to expense until the affected employees were notified of the termination and the company had committed to provide for such costs 
in fiscal  the company charged million to operations  related to two restructurings which occurred during the year 
the first restructuring charge was million and was completed in anticipation of the reorganization related to the december  spin off of the hi fn subsidiary 
primary components of the charge were losses on property and equipment abandonments million and severance and employee related liabilities paid for terminated employees million 
the second restructuring was million and was designed to contain development costs by utilizing offshore facilities for these functions 
the amount charged to restructuring included severance and employee related liabilities paid for terminated employees million and lease termination costs million 
interest income interest income was million in fiscal and million in and the reduction in interest income from fiscal to was primarily due to lower invested balances during the fiscal year  as a result of the completion of the company s stock repurchase program in fiscal the amount did not change from fiscal to despite lower balances available for investment  due to a change in investment policy  away from tax exempt securities  towards higher yielding commercial paper 
the company invests the majority of its funds in high quality commercial paper and tax exempt securities 
income taxes for fiscal  the company reported a benefit from income taxes of million 
this amount reflects net operating loss carrybacks to be applied to prior periods tax liabilities 
the effective tax rate of is lower than the statutory federal and state rates due to alternative minimum tax limitations the company s net operating loss carryback is subject to 
the company continues to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
for fiscal  the company reported a provision for income taxes of million  which is inclusive of a charge to establish a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets 
before the valuation allowance  the benefit for income taxes was million for an effective tax rate of 
the valuation allowance was recorded as a result of an assessment made of future taxable income as required by accounting standards  made in conjunction with the anticipated spin off of the company s hi fn subsidiary 
the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory federal and state rates primarily due to non deductible expenses related to the spin off and due to differences in tax rules impacting foreign operations 
for fiscal  the company reported a provision for income for taxes of million on income before income taxes of million  an effective rate of 
the effective tax rate for is lower than the statutory federal and state rates due primarily to tax exempt interest earned on cash equivalents and marketable securities 
differences in effective tax rates among years is also affected by the proportion of earnings from interest income and foreign operations to total earnings and the different statutory tax rates associated with them 
quarterly trends and channel inventories the company historically has experienced significant fluctuations in its revenues and operating results  including net income  and anticipates that these fluctuations will continue 
the company operates with relatively little backlog of its software sales  and the majority of its software revenues each quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
consequently  if near term demand for the company s products weakens in a given quarter or if inventory of the company s products in the retail and distribution channels satisfies near term demand  the company s operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected 
in addition  when the company announces enhanced versions of its software products  the announcement may have the effect of slowing sales of the current version of the product as buyers delay their purchases 
quarterly results have been or may in the future be influenced by the timing of announcements or introductions of new products and product upgrades by the company or its competitors  distributor ordering patterns  product returns  delays in product development and licensing of the company s products and core technology 
in addition  the company s new products typically have a lengthy evaluation period before any purchase is made 
seasonality the software industry has typically experienced some seasonal variations in demand  with sales declining somewhat in the summer months 
the company believes that its software sales are subject to similar seasonal variations which  when combined with the other factors described above  are likely to result in fluctuations in the company s quarterly results 
as a result  historical quarter to quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
operating systems stac s replica tape  replica ndm and reachout products currently operate on a limited number of personal computer and network operating systems 
reachout supports microsoft windows nt  windows  windows  windows x and dos  while replica tape supports windows nt and novell netware servers 
replica tape customers may require support of the unix operating system  which the company does not currently provide 
replica ndm server component supports only windows nt with client support for windows  windows and windows nt workstation 
in addition  future versions of microsoft s windows operating systems may require significant changes to the company s products in order to maintain compatibility 
stock price volatility due to the factors noted above  the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in earnings from levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period 
shortfalls could be caused by shortfalls in revenues  timing of the receipt of technology license fees  and or increased levels of expenditures 
additionally  the company participates in a highly dynamic industry  which often results in significant volatility of the company s stock price 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by million to million at september  from million at september  the increase was primarily attributable to the repayment of a million loan from the company s former hi fn subsidiary 
accounts receivable increased by million to million at september  from that at september   primarily attributable to higher balances outstanding from a major customer  related to increased sales from that customer 
working capital increased by million to million at september  from that at september   primarily as a result of the changes in cash and marketable securities discussed above 
the company believes that existing cash balances and funds provided by operations will be sufficient to finance the working capital requirements of the consolidated companies for the foreseeable future 
year the term year issue is a general term used to describe the various problems that may result from the improper processing of dates and date sensitive calculations by computers and other machinery as the year is approached and reached 
these problems generally arise from the fact that most of the world s computer hardware and software have historically used only two digits to identify the year in a date  often meaning that the computer will fail to distinguish dates in the s from dates in the s 
these problems may also arise from other sources as well  such as the use of special codes and conventions in software that make use of the date field 
to date  the company s primary focus in its analysis of its year issue has been on its product offerings 
stac has performed extensive year compliance testing of its current products and believes  to its best knowledge  that current versions of replica tape  replica ndm and reachout enterprise the products are year compliant  provided that the underlying operating system and other software with which these products are being used are year compliant 
the company has also completed its evaluation of year compliance with respect to all of its internal computer  telephone and security systems hardware and software 
the company has determined that all business critical systems are year compliant 
as of december   the company had spent approximately  on purchases of new hardware and software to insure year compliance  and does not expect to spend any significant additional amounts toward this purpose 
in addition  the company has communicated with certain significant third parties with which it does business for the purpose of discussing and evaluating their year compliance plans and state of readiness and to determine the extent to which the company s systems may be affected by the failure of others to remediate their own year issues 
the company has received feedback from such parties indicating that they are in the process of implementing measures to ensure year compliance  and further representing that they will achieve compliance before the close of calendar the company has not independently confirmed any information received from any other parties with respect to year issues 
as such  there can be no assurance that such other parties will complete their year conversion in a timely fashion or will not suffer a year business disruption that may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
to date  the company has not identified any internal system which presents a material risk of not being year ready in a timely fashion or for which a suitable alternative cannot be implemented 
however  the company may ultimately identify systems which do present a material risk of year disruption 
such disruption may include  among other things  the inability to process transactions or information  procure inventory  or engage in similar normal business activities 
the failure of the company to identify systems which require year conversion that are critical to the company s operations or the failure of the company or others with which the company does business to become year ready in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
as part of the company s contingency year effort  information received from external sources is examined for date integrity before being brought into the company s internal systems 
the company will incorporate alternatives into its contingency plan  should the software upgrades described above prove to not fully resolve year compliance issues 
if the company determines that its business is at material risk of disruption due to currently unforeseen year issue or anticipates that its year compliance will not be achieved in a timely fashion  the company will work to enhance its contingency plan 
the discussion above contains certain forward looking statements 
the costs of the year conversion and possible risks associated with the year issue are based on the company s current estimates and are subject to various uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations 
such uncertainties include  among others  the success of the company in identifying systems that are not year compliant  the nature and amount of programming required to upgrade or replace each of the affected systems  the availability of qualified personnel  consultants and other resources  and the success of the year conversion efforts of others 
market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and changes in the market value of its investments 
the company s foreign currency risks are mitigated principally by maintaining only nominal foreign currency cash balances 
working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of the company s subsidiary in the united kingdom are kept in the local currencies for the european countries in which they do business  with excess funds converted to united states currency and transferred to stac s offices in the united states for investment 
the fair value of the company s investments in marketable securities at september   was million 
the company s investment policy is to manage its portfolio of marketable securities in order to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return 
at september   the company s portfolio was primarily invested in high quality commercial paper  typically with maturities of less than six months 
these investments are distributed among several issuers to minimize the credit risk associated with any single institution
