item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is engaged in the research  development and commercialization of products for the non invasive diagnosis of cardiac disease 
using innovative technologies  the company is addressing such key problems in cardiac diagnosis as the identification of those at risk of sudden cardiac arrest  the early detection of coronary artery disease  and the prompt and accurate diagnosis of heart attack 
clinical research published to date has demonstrated that the presence of t wave alternans is associated with an increased vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest 
sudden cardiac arrest accounts for approximately one half of all cardiac related deaths  or about  in the united states each year 
the company s principal products are the ch system and hi resolution electrodes 
both products have received k clearance from the fda for sale in the united states 
the k clearance allows the claim that the ch can measure the presence of t wave alternans but does not allow a claim about the applicability or prognostic use of the measurement 
the company has submitted a k application to the fda for expansion of its labeling claims regarding the predictive accuracy of the measurement of t wave alternans 
these labeling restrictions have limited the company s ability to aggressively market its ch system in the united states 
the ch system has received the ce mark for sale in europe and is approved for sale by the ministry of health in japan 
the company has experienced substantial net losses since its inception in and expects net losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that its research and development expenses will increase in the future in support of its efforts to develop additional products and also to fund clinical trials directed at expanding the indications for use of its t wave alternans technology 
the company s research and development expenses may also increase in the future as it supplements its internal research and development with third party technology licenses and potential product acquisitions 
the company also expects that its selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in connection with the expansion of efforts targeted at acceleration of the rate of adoption of its technology as diagnostic tool for the identification of those at risk of sudden cardiac arrest 
the future growth of the company s revenues will depend upon the success of these strategies  as well as numerous factors including competition and the availability of third party reimbursement for t wave alternans measurement 
the company has incurred cumulative net losses since inception through december  of approximately  results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were  in the fiscal year ended december  fiscal and  for the fiscal year ended december  fiscal  an increase of  or 
sales of the company s ch system and accessories accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the remainder of the revenues in each year were from the sale of the company s proprietary  disposable hi resolution electrodes 
revenues from products sold outside the united states were  in fiscal  an increase of  or over the previous fiscal year 
revenues from products sold to japan were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
revenues from products sold to the remaining international customers were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of 
at the end of fiscal  the company changed distribution partners in europe due to their failure to meet contract terms 
a new distributor was appointed  effective april  the company believes this transition accounted for the decline in revenues during fiscal the company expects european revenues to return to previous levels during sales to all international customers accounted for of the company s total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales to us customers were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in us revenues results from improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the company s sales organization  which was expanded during the company employs direct sales managers in the us and had independent manufacturers sales representatives under contract at the end of fiscal cost of goods sold was  or of total revenues  in fiscal and  of total revenues  in fiscal the improved ratio of costs to product sales during fiscal is the result of the company s product cost reduction programs targeted at reducing the cost of direct materials and the impact of increases in production volumes on the allocation of fixed overhead costs 
the continued increase in percentage of revenues from us customers  which have a higher margin  has favorably affected the overall cost of sales ratio 
the company anticipates that these factors together with increases in revenues of its hi resolution disposable electrodes will continue to favorably effect the overall gross margin 
research and development costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the company incurred incremental costs totaling  during fiscal to complete its clinical studies supporting the k filed with fda for expansion of its labeling claims for its t wave alternans technology 
these costs were partially offset by a reduction in of  in the amount of compensation expense recorded relating to stock options granted to non employees for services rendered and an increase during fiscal over fiscal of  in the amount of software development costs capitalized under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase is primarily the result of the costs associated with compensation paid to us sales representatives associated with the increase in revenues during fiscal the company continues to increase its marketing efforts targeted at the rapid adoption of t wave alternans testing by clinical cardiologists and other medical professionals 
additionally  during fiscal  the company experienced several changes in management personnel 
as a result  the company recorded  of termination costs associated with these changes 
interest income for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of the net reduction in the company s cash and marketable securities balances by  during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were  in the fiscal year ended december  fiscal and  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
sales of the company s ch system and accessories accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the remainder of the revenues were from the sale of the company s proprietary  disposable hi resolution electrodes 
revenues from products sold outside the united states were  in fiscal  an increase of  or  over fiscal revenues from products sold outside the united states accounted for of the company s total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal sales to united states customers were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the united states increase reflects the impact of the expansion of the number of trained sales representatives during fiscal the company employed five direct sales managers for most of fiscal compared to two for most of fiscal at the end of fiscal  the company had over independent manufacturers sales representatives under contract compared to at the end of fiscal cost of goods sold was  of product sales  in fiscal and  of product sales  in fiscal the improved ratio of costs to product sales during fiscal primarily reflects the impact of increased volumes on the allocation of fixed manufacturing overheads 
research and development costs were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase reflects the expansion in the company s clinical trial activities to support the filing of a k with the fda in for expansion of product labeling claims for its t wave alternans technology 
the company recorded a charge of  in fiscal to recognize costs associated with non qualified stock options issued under the equity incentive plan to scientific advisors 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily the result of the costs associated with the expansion of the company s us field sales organization during fiscal and increases in the cost of marketing efforts targeted at the adoption of t wave alternans testing by clinical cardiologists and other medical professionals 
additionally  during fiscal  the company experienced several changes in management personnel 
as a result  the company recorded  of termination costs associated with these changes 
interest income for fiscal was  compared to  for fiscal the increase reflects a full year of interest earned on the investment of the remaining proceeds associated with the company s initial public offering of common stock in august inflation and income taxes inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations for any of the years in the period ended december  the company has not recorded a provision for income taxes for the years   and because it incurred net losses in each of such years 
at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of  as well as  research and development credit carryforwards  respectively  available to offset future taxable income and income tax liabilities  respectively 
these carryforwards generally expire in the years through and may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in the company s ownership 
there can be no assurance that changes in ownership in future periods or continuing losses will not significantly limit the company s use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company has generated taxable losses from operations since inception and  accordingly  has no taxable income available to offset the carryback of net operating losses 
in addition  although management s operating plans anticipate taxable income in future periods  such plans provide for taxable losses over the near term and make significant assumptions which cannot be reasonably assured including approval of the company s products by the fda and market acceptance of these products by customers 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance  at december  for its deferred tax assets since  in the opinion of management  realization of these future benefits is not sufficiently assured defined as a likelihood of slightly more than percent 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations from the sale of equity securities 
through june   the company had raised  net of stock issuance costs from the sales of equity securities 
on august   the company raised approximately  net of stock issuance costs from the sale of  shares of common stock in the company s initial public offering 
in conjunction with the initial public offering   shares of preferred stock were converted to shares of common stock 
the proceeds of the equity offerings have been used primarily to fund operating losses of  reflecting expenditures to support research  new product development and clinical trials activities  to support a marketing and sales organization  and to support an administrative infrastructure and the investment of approximately  in property and equipment through december  as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  during fiscal  the company increased its level of operations  with corresponding increases in most balance sheet accounts 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by  from december  to december   consistent with the company s net loss for fiscal accounts receivable  net  increased by  during the year  reflecting increased sales activity and the broadening of the company s customer base 
inventory levels have increased slightly from  to  during the year 
fixed asset additions during the year primarily represent increased sales demonstration and clinical research units as the company has expanded activities in both of these areas 
the company expects its capital expenditures to increase as it continues to commercialize its products  particularly in connection with the manufacture of its proprietary hi resolution electrodes 
the company does not expect capital expenditures to exceed an aggregate of  over the next two years 
under the terms of various license  consulting and technology agreements  the company is required to pay royalties on sales of its products 
minimum license maintenance fees under these license agreements  which are creditable against royalties otherwise payable for each year  range from  to  per year in total through the company is committed to pay an aggregate of  of such minimum license maintenance fees subsequent to december  as part of these agreements  the company is also committed to meet certain development and sales milestones  including a requirement to spend a minimum of  in any two year period for research and development  clinical trials  marketing  sales and or manufacturing of products related to certain technology covered by the consulting and technology agreements 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  including the amounts raised in the initial public offering  will be adequate to satisfy its capital requirements until the end of thereafter  the company will require additional funds to support its operating requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing would be obtainable on terms acceptable to the company 
year issues many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept or recognize only two digit entries in the date code field 
these systems may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year as a result  computer systems and or software used by many companies and government agencies may need to be upgraded to comply with year requirements or risk system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of normal business activities 
the company is currently in the process of assessing its exposure to the year issue and has established a response to that exposure 
generally  the company has year exposure in three areas i the company s business information systems  including computer operating systems and applications  ii the hardware and software included in the ch system  and iii computer systems used by third parties  including suppliers of the company 
the company has completed its assessment of each of these areas 
the company has upgraded its existing software to versions that are year compliant and is in the process of installing a new business information system for functionality reasons 
the new business information system is expected to be in place by mid all business information system changes would be performed regardless of the year issue from both a timing and cost perspective 
the company therefore believes that it has spent and is spending an immaterial incremental amount on year remediation over what it would spend to implement its planned business information system improvements 
the company believes that its ch system is year compliant 
software used in the ch system has been upgraded to year compliant versions and the company has successfully tested hardware  operating system and applications software simulating post year systems clock dates 
the company has sent written requests for year information to all suppliers 
the company has been informed by all suppliers of material hardware and software components of the ch system  and substantially all other suppliers  that the products used by the company are currently year compliant 
management continues to support the compliance efforts through allocation of the resources necessary to complete the project 
based on the completed initial assessment  management does not expect the costs of bringing the company s systems into compliance with year to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company does not believe that it is subject to significant business risks related to its customers and suppliers year efforts 
factors which may affect future results this annual report on form k the annual report contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report 
in this section  we  us and our refer to cambridge heart  inc unless the context otherwise requires 
we may never generate substantial revenues we are engaged primarily in the commercialization  manufacture  research and development of our products for the non invasive diagnosis of cardiac disease 
we have incurred substantial and increasing net losses through december  there can be no assurance that we will ever generate substantial revenues or achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
revenues generated from the sale of our products will depend upon numerous factors  including 
the timing of regulatory actions  
progress of product development  
the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  
competition  and 
the availability of third party reimbursement 
we may not receive timely regulatory approval of important labeling claims the measurement of t wave alternans to diagnose vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia is a new diagnostic approach that is currently investigational 
we have submitted a k application for clearance from the fda for a labeling claim covering the applicability or prognostic use of our t wave alternans technology 
there can be no assurance that the fda will concur with our k request for clearance 
the failure to obtain k clearance for additional labeling claims for the ch system would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our technology may never achieve market acceptance we believe that our future success will substantially depend upon the successful commercialization and market acceptance of our t wave alternans technology 
market acceptance will depend upon our ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for claims covering the applicability or prognostic use of t wave alternans measurement  as well as our ability to demonstrate the diagnostic advantages and cost effectiveness of the technology 
there can be no assurance that regulatory approval for such claims will ever be received or that we will be able to successfully commercialize or achieve market acceptance of our t wave alternans technology or that our competitors will not develop competing technologies that are superior to our technology 
the results of future clinical studies may not support the usefulness of our technology we have sponsored and are continuing to sponsor clinical studies relating to our t wave alternans technology and hi resolution electrodes to establish the prognostic value of such technology 
while studies on high risk patients to date have indicated that the measurement of t wave alternans to predict vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia is at least comparable to electrophysiology testing  there can be no assurances that the results of such studies  particularly studies involving patients who are not high risk  will produce similar results 
any clinical studies or trials which fail to demonstrate that t wave alternans is at least comparable in accuracy to alternative diagnostic tests  or which otherwise call into question the cost effectiveness  efficacy or safety of our technology  or our other technologies  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may never receive necessary foreign regulatory approvals a significant portion of our current revenues is dependent upon sales of our products outside the united states 
foreign regulatory bodies have established varying regulations  duties and tax requirements 
specifically  the european union has promulgated rules which require that medical products receive the right to affix the ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain european union approval for any future products 
the inability or failure of cambridge heart or its international distributors to comply with varying foreign regulations or the imposition of new regulations could restrict or  in certain countries  result in the prohibition of the sale of our products  and thereby adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have difficulty responding to changing technology the medical device market is characterized by rapidly advancing technology 
our future success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with advancing technology and competitive innovations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that new products or alternative diagnostic techniques will not be developed that will render our current or planned products obsolete or inferior 
rapid technological development by competitors may result in our products becoming obsolete before we recover a significant portion of the research  development and commercialization expenses incurred with respect to such products 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources competition from competitors medical devices that help to diagnose cardiac disease is intense and likely to increase 
we compete with manufacturers of electrocardiogram stress tests  the conventional method of diagnosing ischemic heart disease  and may compete with manufacturers of other non invasive tests  including electrocardiogram s  holter monitors  ultrasound tests and systems of measuring cardiac late potentials 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources  name recognition  research and development experience and regulatory  manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
many of these competitors offer well established  broad product lines and ancillary services not offered by cambridge heart 
some of our competitors have long term or preferential supply arrangements with physicians and hospitals which may act as a barrier to market entry 
we depend heavily on our ability to identify and retain effective independent manufacturers representatives and foreign distributors we currently market our products in the united states through a small direct sales force and independent manufacturers representatives 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to recruit and retain skilled sales management  direct sales persons or independent manufacturers representatives 
we market our products internationally through independent distributors 
these distributors may also distribute competing products under certain circumstances 
the loss of a significant international distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business if a new distributor  sales representative or other suitable sales organization cannot be found on a timely basis in the relevant geographic market 
to the extent that we rely on sales in certain territories through distributors  any revenues we receive in those territories will depend upon the efforts of our distributors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a distributor will market our products successfully or that the terms of its distribution arrangements will be acceptable to us 
our business could be subject to product liability claims the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of medical devices entail the inherent risk of liability claims or product recalls 
although we maintain product liability insurance in the united states and in other countries in which we intend to conduct business  including clinical trials and product marketing and sales  there can be no assurance that such coverage is adequate or will continue to be available 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or product recall could inhibit or prevent commercialization of the ch system or cause a significant financial burden on cambridge heart  or both  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and ability to market the ch system as currently contemplated 
the cost of our products may not be covered by third party payors our ability to successfully market our products is likely to depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and the procedures in which such products are used will be available from third party payors  including 
government third party payors including the medicare and medicaid programs  
government health administration authorities  and 
private health insurers 
these third party payors may deny coverage if they determine that a procedure was not reasonable or necessary as determined by the payor  was experimental or was used for an unapproved indication 
in addition  certain healthcare providers are moving towards a managed care system in which such providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person  irrespective of the amount of care actually provided 
such providers  in an effort to control healthcare costs are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and  in some instances  have pressured medical suppliers to lower their prices 
we are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods utilized by third party healthcare payors 
furthermore  we could be adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payors  particularly to the extent any such changes affect reimbursement for procedures in which our products are used 
if coverage and adequate reimbursement levels are not provided by government or third party payors for uses on our technologies or products  our business  financial position and ability to market our technologies or products may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to commercialize the ch system we expect to derive a substantial majority of our future revenues from sales of our ch system and high resolution electrodes 
if we are unable to commercialize these products successfully  the period during which we are in the development stage would be extended significantly 
this would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a number of risks associated with the year although we do not believe that year issues will have a significant impact on our internal operations or on our products  there can be no assurance that we will not experience interruptions of operations because of year problems 
year problems could require us to incur unanticipated expenses  and such expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the purchasing patterns of customers or potential customers may be affected by year issues as companies expend significant resources to correct their current systems for year compliance 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds being available to purchase products offered by cambridge heart 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in january  the securities and exchange commission issued financial reporting release no 
 which expands the disclosure requirements for certain derivatives and other financial instruments 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments 
see notes and to the financials statements for a description of the company s use of other financial instruments 
the carrying amounts reflected in the balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximates fair value at december  due to the short maturities of these instruments
