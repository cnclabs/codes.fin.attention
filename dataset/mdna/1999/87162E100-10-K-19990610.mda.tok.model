item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
strategy synthetech s strategy is to emphasize a commitment to its customers from the early phases of drug discovery through clinical development in order to develop larger orders as the drugs receive regulatory approval 
the two large scale pbb orders in fiscal exemplified this strategy 
the company had supplied pbbs for both of these drugs since their early clinical development stages 
product overview peptide building blocks 
pbbs are amino acids which have been chemically modified through organic chemistry and biocatalysis techniques to enable them to link with other amino acids or chemicals in a particular defined sequence 
these pbbs are pharmaceutical intermediates and are used as starting materials in the manufacture of peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs 
the amino acids which are transformed into pbbs may be either natural amino acids that is  amino acids which occur in nature  including their chiral or mirror image form or synthetic amino acids that is  amino acids which have a side chain that does not occur in nature 
synthetech refers to the synthetic amino acids as specialty amino acids 
since  the company has produced a wide range of natural amino acid pbb products 
the company has also developed and manufactures over three dozen specialty amino acids 
the company uses a wide array of raw materials to produce pbbs 
these materials generally are in adequate supply from multiple suppliers 
the company has developed and scaled up process technology to produce this wide range of pbb products in a grams to tons scale 
the company continues to produce most bulk orders on an as ordered basis 
the company also maintains small inventory quantities of many pbbs  permitting immediate deliveries 
at march   the dollar amount of backlog orders was million  all of which the company expects to ship during fiscal over two thirds of the backlog million represents a diverse set of pbbs including several specialty amino acids for a handful of drugs advancing through the clinical pipeline 
the remaining balance of this backlog million represents the final shipments under a discontinued large scale order 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
at march   the dollar amount of backlog orders was million 
this backlog included million attributable to two large scale orders 
in january  the company entered into supply and technology agreements with biomeasure incorporated  a boston area biotechnology company and a subsidiary of groupe pharmaceutique beaufour ipsen of france with several specialty amino acids under development 
under the supply agreement  the company has agreed to supply all of biomeasure s requirements for a particular specialty amino acid 
this agreement continues from year to year unless terminated in writing by one of the parties 
the company and biomeasure are also parties to a license agreement giving biomeasure the option to receive a license to produce for its own use the specialty amino acids which are the subject of the supply agreement between the parties 
under this license agreement  biomeasure must pay certain royalty amounts based on any amount it produces 
marketing the company markets its products and capabilities through attendance at trade shows  listings in biotechnology and chemical industry directories  advertisements in chemical trade periodicals and its internet website 
in addition  the company maintains ongoing direct relationships with major pharmaceutical firms  emerging biopharmaceutical firms  contract drug synthesis firms and other firms which it believes might have a need for its products 
the company typically sells its products directly to its customers  although it uses sales representatives for some european sales and has often sold products to japanese customers through chemical trading firms 
customers although the company has several hundred customers in countries  the company expects that a few customers will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues each year 
during fiscal  the top customers represented of the company s revenues 
of these twenty customers  ten were major pharmaceutical companies  four were emerging biopharmaceutical companies and six were contract drug synthesis companies 
the company had two customers f 
hoffman la roche  ltd 
and pfizer  inc which individually accounted for over and  respectively  of the company s fiscal revenues 
for the fiscal years ended march    and  sales to international customers were million  million and million  respectively  accounting for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s total revenues 
these sales were principally to europe for fiscal and  and to europe and japan for fiscal see note j to financial statements 
competition because peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs are relatively new  the market in the past for pbbs has been quite small with sales typically in the hundreds of kilos or smaller size 
as a result  the pbb market has not attracted a significant amount of direct competition 
as the market continues to grow with larger order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in multi kilo quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to attract a wider group of approximately a dozen domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of specialty amino acids  the company has competition on a selected product basis at the multi kilo scale from approximately half a dozen fine chemical producers in europe  japan and the united states 
competition also increases for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into approved status as a result of the increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
many of the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them which are significantly greater than those available to the company 
the principal methods of competition in the market for pbbs and other fine chemicals are quality  delivery responsiveness  customer service and price 
the company believes that it competes effectively in each of these areas 
the company also believes that its production of a wide range of products and quantities gives it a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
in addition  the company believes that pharmaceutical companies generally view internal production of pbbs as a misallocation of resources and  given a reliable source of a quality product  would rather obtain them from an outside supplier 
research and development the company s research and development group is composed of seven people  of which three have graduate degrees in chemistry 
the company s research and development efforts focus on process development to support the company s pbb product lines 
in addition  the group explores alternative scaleable routes for pbb production  especially for its specialty amino acids 
during the fiscal years ended march    and  the company s research and development expenses were   and  respectively 
these figures  however  do not completely reflect the company s research and development activity since substantial process development efforts have been associated with initial orders for new products and  accordingly  have been expensed as cost of sales associated with the product revenue rather than as a research and development expense 
the company estimates that its combined research and development effort including effort directly associated with the sale of product was approximately   and  during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
employees as of may   the company employed individuals 
in addition to production  maintenance  materials handling and quality control personnel essential for a round the clock operation  the company added technical and professional staff in various support functions during fiscal in keeping with the growing regulatory and compliance demands of the industry  synthetech also added full time coordinators in the areas of quality assurance and environment  health safety 
regulatory matters as the company s products are intermediates sold to drug manufacturers  the company has been generally unaffected by fda regulation which is directed at the drug manufacturers 
the company s customers do  however  typically conduct periodic reviews and audits of the company s operations  including its inspection and quality assurance programs 
these programs involve materials tracking  record keeping and other documentation 
as some customers have begun to request the company to manufacture and supply pbbs with additional processing  the company expects these programs will often include more extensive documentation 
the company anticipates that the expenses of implementing these programs will increase in the future 
the company s business is also subject to substantial regulation in the areas of safety  environmental control and hazardous waste management 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
as additional and more extensive regulations are being added in these areas at the federal  state and local levels  the compliance costs will inevitably continue to increase 
the operation of fine chemical manufacturing plants entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or an unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
also  the company generates hazardous and other wastes which are disposed of at various off site facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these disposal facilities due to releases of such substances into the environment 
the company estimates that in fiscal and fiscal  it will undertake capital expenditures aggregating  associated with air quality scrubbers  waste water handling and other environmental control facilities 
the company maintains property damage insurance  liability insurance  environmental risk insurance  and product liability insurance 
product liability use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk of product liability 
there can be no assurance that claims for product liability will not be asserted against the company or that the company would be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company maintains product liability insurance with a million limit 
also  the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage 
company background the company was formed in to develop novel chemical process technology by combining classical organic chemistry with enzyme based biocatalysis 
for the first several years  it operated mainly as a research and development group focused on process development of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals 
after its initial public offering in  the company s research efforts were concentrated on the development of a proprietary process for aspartame and l phenylalanine 
although the company has entered into one license for this technology  the company discontinued marketing this technology in and does not expect additional licensing revenue 
throughout its development during the s  the company also offered contract research services 
these research services were typically provided to pharmaceutical clients and generally involved the development of biocatalytic processes that is  chemical processes which are affected by the use of enzymes or micro organisms 
since the end of fiscal  the company has phased out contract research services and does not anticipate receiving any significant revenue from research services in the future 
by the end of the s  the company  building on prior experience  began to focus on the production of pbbs and other fine chemicals for customers 
with the successful completion of the two large scale orders in fiscal  the company has emerged as a leading producer of pbbs capable of full cycle grams to tons production 
factors affecting future results this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements as defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate or imply future results  performance or achievements  and may contain the words believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  project  will be  will continue  will likely result or words or phrases of similar meanings 
investors are cautioned that forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following uncertain market for products  customer concentration  and potential quarterly revenue fluctuations 
historically  the company has experienced from time to time substantial period to period revenue fluctuations reflecting the industry environment in which the company has operated 
the market for pbbs is driven by the market for the synthetically manufactured peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs into which they are incorporated 
the drug development process is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drug development  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the food and drug administration fda  and  even if approved  the ultimate potential of such drugs 
recurring sales of pbbs for discovery or clinical trial stage development programs is sporadic at best 
the high cancellation rate for drug development programs results in a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level of purchasing by the company s customers for specific drug development programs varies substantially from year to year and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs provide an opportunity for continuing longer term sales and the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs remains subject to many uncertainties  including  without limitation  the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
since the company s revenues are composed of pbb sales in all three drug development stages  and since even sales of pbbs for marketed drugs are subject to cancellation or reduction  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly results 
industry cost factors 
the market for pbbs is dependent on the market for pharmaceutical products 
the levels of revenues and profitability of pharmaceutical companies may be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  there have been  and the company expects that there will continue to be  a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls 
in addition  in both the united states and elsewhere  sales of prescription pharmaceuticals are dependent in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payors such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs may not be considered cost effective  and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow these drugs to be sold on a profitable basis 
in addition  as cost pressures in the pharmaceutical industry have tightened  the cancellation rate for drug development programs has increased 
industry cost pressures can also cause pharmaceutical companies to investigate alternative drug manufacturing processes which may not include pbbs 
competition 
in the past  the company has not had a significant amount of direct competition for discovery and clinical trial stage drug development projects 
the company believes that this resulted from peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs  particularly those which utilize synthetic amino acids  being relatively new and the market for pbbs relatively small 
as the market has continued to grow with multi ton order sizes becoming more prevalent  the company has begun to see more competition 
current competition in the multi kilo or smaller quantities of natural amino acid based pbbs comes primarily from several european fine chemical companies 
multi ton order sizes of these natural pbbs have begun to attract a wider group of domestic and international chemical companies 
in the area of synthetic amino acid based pbbs  the company has competition on a selective product basis from fine chemical producers in europe and japan 
competition has also increased for supplying pbbs for drug development programs that reach late clinical trials and move into an approved status as a result of increased quantities typically required at these stages and pharmaceutical company requirements to have second sources of material available 
the company s competitors have technical  financial  selling and other resources available to them that are significantly greater than those available to the company 
regulatory matters 
the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals 
although the company believes that it is in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations in all material respects  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require the company to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a chemical manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances  and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
in addition  the company generates hazardous materials and other wastes which are disposed at various offsite facilities 
the company may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these disposal facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 
the company has obtained environmental risk insurance 
potential regulation 
the pbbs produced by the company are intermediate ingredients which are then processed by the companies to which they are sold  and are therefore currently not subject to the requirements of the fda 
the company s customers do  however  typically conduct periodic reviews and audits of the company s operations  including its inspection and quality assurance programs 
these programs involve materials tracking  record keeping and other documentation 
as some customers have begun to request the company to manufacture and supply pbbs with additional processing  the company believes that these programs will often become more extensive 
accordingly  the company expects its compliance documentation efforts will continue to increase and anticipates that the expenses of implementing such programs will increase in the future 
it is also possible that in the future that the company may not be able to comply with the applicable documentation or such documentation may require substantial incremental expense for additional labor and capital 
product liability 
use of the company s products in pharmaceuticals and the subsequent testing  marketing and sale of such pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk of product liability 
claims for product liability could be asserted against the company and the company may not be able to successfully defend any claim that may be asserted 
a product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on the business and or financial condition of the company 
the company has purchased product liability insurance with a limit of million 
also  the company maintains an umbrella liability insurance policy with an additional million of coverage 
risks of technological change 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid changes in both product and process technologies 
the company s future results of operations will depend upon its ability to improve and market its existing products and to successfully develop  manufacture and market new products 
the company may not be able to continue to improve and market its existing products or develop and market new products  and technological developments could cause the company s products and technology to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
manufacturing capacity 
as a manufacturer of pbbs  the company will continually face risks regarding the availability and costs of raw materials and labor  the potential need for additional capital equipment  increased maintenance costs  plant and equipment obsolescence and quality control 
in november  the company completed construction of an additional manufacturing facility on its site in albany  oregon 
in this first phase  processing equipment was installed in two of the six bays 
in may  the company announced its decision to install processing equipment in two additional bays and to construct additional warehouse  bulk storage and related facilities 
the company expects that this second phase will be completed in calendar completion of the second phase at the new facility could be delayed and the existing facilities may not have sufficient capacity to meet the demand for the company s products  particularly in the event that several of the peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs for which the company supplies pbbs simultaneously become commercially successful 
a disruption in the company s production or distribution could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
in addition  the company may not have sufficient demand to utilize the additional capacity 
risks of international business 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately of the company s net sales during the fiscal year ended march  the company expects that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of net sales 
the company s business is and will be subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally  including changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates  foreign governmental regulation and changes in economic conditions 
these factors  among others  could influence the company s ability to sell its products in international markets 
in addition  the company s sale of its products is subject to the risks associated with legislation and regulation relating to imports  including quotas  duties or taxes and other charges  restrictions and retaliatory actions on imports in to other countries in which the company s products may be sold 
the company is also subject to similar risks with respect to the importation of raw materials from foreign countries 
year compliance 
after review  the company believes that its information systems which support business applications and its research and development  manufacturing processes and facility management systems currently are able to appropriately interpret the calendar year yk and subsequent years or will be able to appropriately interpret yk and subsequent years after certain upgrades are completed by the summer of while the company does not believe it to be the case  there is a risk that the company s software applications will be unable to appropriately interpret such years despite the installation of these upgrades 
the failure to correct a material yk problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failures could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk issue  resulting in part from the uncertainty of the yk readiness of third party suppliers and customers  the company is unable to determine at this time whether the consequences of yk failures will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
item properties synthetech s headquarters and production facilities are located in albany  oregon 
in  the company purchased the albany  oregon property which included a  square foot facility 
this original facility houses production  pilot plant  laboratory  warehouse and office space 
in november  the company completed the construction of an additional  square foot production facility on the albany  oregon property 
the completion of this additional two story production facility substantially increases the company s capacity to produce pbbs and other fine chemicals 
this facility has six production bays 
two of the bays are outfitted with manufacturing equipment and are in production 
on may   the company announced its decision to outfit two more bays 
the company expects that these additional two bays will be completed during summer the final two bays remain vacant and available for future expansion 
in the initial construction of the building and the build out of the bays  synthetech has contracted with various third party providers 
the company has issued purchase orders to such providers with detailed specifications  services to be provided and the prices to be paid 
the company has received either limited or no written warranties by such third party providers and  therefore  may be limited in its ability to pursue remedies in the event that the new building has problems or other defects in the future 
however  the building has been inspected by the city of albany to verify that  as constructed  it meets all applicable building codes  including ada  electrical  seismic  fire and hazardous occupancy 
all specifications were reviewed by an independent third party engineering firm selected by the city of albany prior to approval of various construction permits

the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the decrease in revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily reflected the impact of large scale orders 
revenues from large scale orders were million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  there were two large scale orders totaling million and million of revenue during the year 
these two pbb orders for marketed drugs were initially received in the third quarter of fiscal and represented  and million of the fiscal large scale order revenue 
the fiscal large scale order revenue was attributable to pbbs for three drugs in clinical trials 
all revenues during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal represented sales of pbbs 
synthetech had record revenues in fiscal fiscal was also the first year in which pbb production for marketed drugs represented over half of the company s annual revenue 
the company estimates that in fiscal approximately of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs  approximately went into drugs in clinical or late pre clinical trials and approximately went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
in fiscal and fiscal  the company estimates that approximately and  respectively  of the company s pbb sales went into marketed drugs  approximately and  respectively  went into drugs in clinical or late pre clinical trials and approximately and  respectively  went into drugs at the r d or discovery stage 
these estimates are based on an analysis of the company s sales and information to the extent available from customers 
synthetech s fiscal large scale production confirmed the company s capability to produce pbbs at the higher volumes often associated with marketed drugs 
combined with the company s already well established production capability at the research and clinical testing stages  the company has demonstrated a full cycle grams to tons production capability 
this full cycle capability reinforces synthetech s long term growth strategy emphasizing a commitment to its customers from the early phases of discovery through clinical development and culminating in marketed drugs 
in fact  the two fiscal large scale orders exemplify this strategy the company had supplied pbbs for both of these drugs since their early clinical development stages 
the level of synthetech s business from period to period continues to be unpredictable to a large extent 
although pbb sales associated with marketed drugs are more likely to provide a longer term  ongoing revenue stream than sales associated with drugs at the discovery or clinical stage  continuation of customer demand for pbbs associated with marketed drugs remains subject to various market conditions  including  without limitation  potential use of alternative manufacturing routes  competition from other suppliers of pbbs and continued market demand for the drug 
for example  the customer to whom the company shipped million in fiscal pbb orders has advised the company that it is adopting an alternative lower cost manufacturing route not using synthetech s pbb 
synthetech does not expect any additional orders for this product from this customer after the current order is completed by the summer of accordingly  while large scale orders for marketed drugs can provide significant and predictable revenues for the duration of the orders  there continues to be a significant risk that revenues can fluctuate from period to period 
the timing of order placement also affects the company s revenues 
the other large scale customer placed its fiscal pbb orders to coincide with its own drug production schedule 
while synthetech believes that it will receive additional orders from this customer  the timing and extent of the customer s next drug production campaign  and thus the order for pbbs  has not been finalized 
with this industry environment  it is difficult to predict with certainty the level of future business 
nevertheless  the company has a sizable backlog of pbb orders of approximately million at march  less than a third of this backlog million represents the final shipments under the discontinued large scale order discussed above 
the balance of the backlog million represents a diverse set of pbbs including several novel pbbs for a handful of drugs advancing through the clinical pipeline 
if these continue to progress and synthetech remains a primary pbb supplier  they could have significant future business potential 
there are  however  many factors  most of which are outside the control of the company  affecting the success of these drug candidates and synthetech s involvement 
see industry factors below 
gross profit gross profit was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this reflects a increase in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal  and a decrease in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal as a percentage of revenues  gross profit margins were  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the gross profit margins for fiscal resulted primarily from the mix of products ie  type and volume of products sold as individual orders and this year s closely associated high revenue levels 
revenues from large scale pbb orders during fiscal represented of total revenue for the period 
while large scale orders for marketed drugs can provide significant revenues for the duration of the orders  they typically generate a lower gross profit margin than the sale of smaller quantities of the same pbb product during the drug discovery and clinical stages 
the company  however  continuously seeks to improve the gross profit margins of large scale orders through process improvements and operating efficiencies 
gross profit margins for fiscal reflected a combination of factors a low level of revenues resulting from the absence of large scale projects until the end of the third quarter of fiscal  the increased manufacturing overhead costs as the new plant facility came online in fiscal  costs associated with the start up and early process development at the new plant facility  and the product mix in fiscal fiscal gross profit margins reflected significant revenue levels  a high margin product mix and the lower manufacturing overhead costs prior to the new plant facility coming online 
the company expects revenues and product mix to continue to fluctuate from period to period and cause variation in gross profit margins 
operating expenses research and development r d expense increased to  or of sales  in fiscal  from  or of sales  in fiscal r d expense was  or  in fiscal these figures  however  do not completely reflect the company s research and development activity since substantial process development efforts have been associated with initial orders for new products and  accordingly  have been expensed as cost of sales associated with the product revenue rather than as a research and development expense 
the company estimates that its combined research and development effort including effort directly associated with the sale of product was approximately   and  during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in sg a in fiscal from fiscal primarily reflected increased labor costs as described below and payments made under an agreement with a former officer of the company 
the decrease in sg a in fiscal from fiscal primarily reflected a reduced employee bonus pool in fiscal as the staffing level in this area remained relatively constant 
sg a as a percentage of sales was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
operating income operating income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  company wide labor costs including the employee bonus pool hereinafter labor costs increased to million from million in fiscal commencing in the second half of fiscal and continuing in fiscal  the company hired additional employees in connection with its plant expansion and overall company growth 
the increase in labor costs in fiscal reflected this hiring program 
in addition  the company s fiscal employee bonus pool was significantly higher than the fiscal year pool  reflecting fiscal s record results 
fiscal labor costs of million were less than the million of labor costs in fiscal while the company hired additional employees during fiscal in connection with its plant expansion  the reduction in the employee bonus pool paid during fiscal as compared to fiscal more than offset the hiring increase  causing the net reduction in labor costs 
as a percentage of revenues  operating income was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal other income the  net other income in fiscal resulted primarily from  of interest earnings less miscellaneous expenses of  the  net other income in fiscal primarily resulted from  of interest earnings and a  recognized gain from the sale of securities available for sale 
the  net other income in fiscal primarily resulted from  of interest earnings 
near the end of fiscal  the company incurred  in wastewater system development charges assessed by the city of albany in connection with the company s plant expansion 
this fee plus interest on the unpaid portion is payable in monthly payments of approximately  through february net income in fiscal  the company earned million before income taxes 
a provision for income taxes of million resulted in net income of million 
in fiscal  the company earned million before income taxes 
a provision for income taxes of  resulted in net income of million

the effective tax rates for the company were relatively flat between years at  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
industry factors the market for pbbs is driven by the market for synthetically manufactured peptide  peptidomimetic small molecule and other drugs in which they are incorporated 
the drug development process for these drugs is dictated by the marketplace  drug companies and the regulatory environment 
the company has no control over the pace of these drug development efforts  which drugs get selected for clinical trials  which drugs are approved by the fda and  even if approved  the ultimate market potential of such drugs 
the three stages of the drug development process include r d or discovery stage  clinical trial stage and marketed drug stage 
synthetech s customers can spend years researching and developing new drugs  taking only a small percentage to clinical trials and fewer yet to commercial market 
a substantial amount of the activity continues to occur at the earlier stages of research and development and clinical trials 
the market for peptide and peptidomimetic small molecule drugs is still very early in development 
recurring sales of pbbs for development programs is sporadic at best 
the high cancellation rate for drug development programs results in a significant likelihood that there will be no subsequent or follow on pbb sales for any particular drug development program 
accordingly  the level of purchasing by the company s customers for specific drug development programs varies substantially from quarter to quarter and the company cannot rely on any one customer as a constant source of revenue 
the size of the pbb orders for marketed drugs can be substantially larger than those for the discovery or clinical trial stages 
sales of pbbs for marketed drugs can also provide an opportunity for continuing longer term sales 
while not subject to the same high cancellation rate faced by discovery and clinical trial stage drug development programs  the demand for the approved drugs  however  remains subject to many uncertainties  including  without limitation  the drug price  the drug side effects and the existence of other competing drugs 
these factors  which are outside of the control of the company  will affect the level of demand for the drug itself and  therefore  the demand for pbbs 
also  industry cost pressures can cause pharmaceutical companies to explore and  as was the case with one of the fiscal large scale orders  ultimately adopt alternative manufacturing processes which do not include the company s pbbs as an intermediate 
finally  with the longer term  larger scale orders  the company expects increased competition to supply these pbbs 
accordingly  these industry factors create an inability for the company to predict future demand beyond its current order base 
until the company develops a stable baseload of demand  the company is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had working capital of million compared to million at march  the company s cash and cash equivalents at march  totaled million  a million increase from the march  level 
this increase reflected the higher level of revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal the company does not invest in derivative securities
