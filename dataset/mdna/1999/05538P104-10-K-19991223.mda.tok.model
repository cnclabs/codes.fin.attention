the following table sets forth  for the fiscal periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the table and the accompanying analysis cover periods in which the businesses now carried on by technologies were operated by electronics 
however  the table and analysis have been prepared as if the company and its businesses were a separate entity for all periods discussed 
year ended october  october  september  net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and related expenses income from operations other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary item  net of income taxes net income continuing operations net sales during fiscal  net sales increased to million from in fiscal  reflecting continuing increases in sales due to the automotive industry s growing demand for the company s gyrochip sensors used in automotive stability systems 
sales to the automotive industry  including the gyrochip sales  increased to million from million in fiscal other commercial sales increased million to million from million during fiscal and sales to the government decreased million to from during fiscal in fiscal  net sales increased to million from million in fiscal  reflecting increases in sales of gyrochip sensors and traditional motion control products  primarily potentiometers and actuators 
the company s sales to international customers were approximately   and of the company s net sales for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in international sales results from the company s gyrochip sensors and the acquisition in august  of ideacod  sa  a sensor manufacturer located in strasbourg  france 
cost of sales and gross profit in fiscal  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points due to increased shipments of products having higher average cost 
management believes that technological initiatives  efforts to increase efficiency in the factory and maintaining close relationships with vendors and customers will lead to reductions in costs thereby increasing margins 
in fiscal  cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points due primarily to start up costs associated with increased production needs for gyrochip sensors 
based upon projections of future demand for the gyrochip sensors product provided by customers  the company incurred significant hiring  training  test production and qualification costs in the second half of fiscal associated with increasing the company s gyrochip sensors manufacturing capacity in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  the shut down and start up of gyrochip sensors production caused by the general motors strike and a resultant decrease in deliveries for six weeks of the fourth quarter had a negative impact on the quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million as a result of increased costs incurred to support the increase in sales during fiscal fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million from million in fiscal to million due primarily to spending to support all growing product areas  primarily gyrochip sensors and precision potentiometers 
research  development and related expenses research and development expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal spending to develop micro electromechanical systems mems for a variety of markets was the principal focus 
research and development expenses in fiscal increased reflecting the company s emphasis on developing new products for commercial markets 
product programs included work on silicon mems  stabilized platforms  and sensors for stability control systems 
the company believes that the continued timely development of new products and enhancements to its existing products is essential to maintaining its competitive position 
accordingly  the company anticipates that expenses associated with such efforts will increase in absolute amount  but may fluctuate as a percentage of sales depending on the company s success in acquiring customers or  in some cases  us government funding 
interest expense and other income interest expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  interest expense primarily related to the company s senior note debt which incurred a lower average interest rate than in the prior year due to restructuring of debt in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the average debt balance increased in fiscal year to fund capital expenditures 
in fiscal  interest expense primarily related to the line of credit and in fiscal  interest expense related to the senior note debt assumed by technologies from electronics in the distribution 
other income in fiscal  and was comprised of royalty income and interest income earned on highly liquid investments 
other income as a percentage of sales was approximately in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal income taxes the company s effective tax rate was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate primarily reflects the statutory federal tax rate and the weighted average tax rate of the states in which the company conducts business 
the decrease of percentage points in the tax rate in fiscal from fiscal results primarily from an increase in federal and state tax credits during fiscal the fiscal rate increased from the fiscal tax rate primarily due to an increase in the company s state taxes subsequent to its spin off from electronics 
deferred income taxes at october   the company had net current deferred income tax assets of million and net non current deferred income tax assets of million 
realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of the underlying temporary differences 
discontinued operations there was no income for defense systems in fiscal income in fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the fiscal income reflects the wind down of rocket operations as a result of discontinuing these activities 
the fiscal income reflects follow on orders for electronics products to support customers requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  operations provided million in cash 
net income of million plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively  and net increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million were partially offset by increases in trade receivables of million  inventories of million and other current assets of million 
investing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of the purchase of million in capital equipment to support new commercial product production  primarily the production of automotive sensors 
fiscal financing activities included proceeds of million from newly issued senior notes and million from the line of credit 
offsetting these proceeds were repayments of million of the old senior notes and million on the bank line of credit see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the distribution in fiscal  the company assumed existing indebtedness of electronics consisting of million of senior notes 
in order to support its initial funding needs  sensors systems borrowed million from a bank on a short term line of credit which it transferred to electronics prior to the distribution to repay a portion of amounts payable to electronics 
subsequent to the distribution  early in fiscal  technologies established a million line of credit with the same bank under which it borrowed million to repay the million borrowed by sensors systems and make a scheduled payment on the senior notes 
in december   the company established a new million  two year line of credit with a bank and terminated the borrowings under the million line referred to above see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  including cash provided by operating activities and available bank borrowings  will be adequate to fund the company s operations for at least the next twelve months 
year compliance modification of management information systems the company has evaluated the potential impact of what is commonly referred to as the year issue  concerning the possible inability of certain products or information systems to properly recognize and process dates beginning with january  and beyond 
if not corrected  these systems could fail or create erroneous results 
the company has completed an assessment of its products and  at this time  does not believe its products present any year issues 
the company s management information systems primarily use software products purchased from commercial sources without significant modification or customization 
updates to these products are routinely installed by the company to upgrade its systems and correct known faults in the software 
all major systems were reviewed during the fourth quarter of fiscal for year issues by an outside consultant and a report was issued to the company s board of directors 
where necessary  the requirements for upgraded hardware and software were implemented by all operating units and completed as of october  approximately  was incurred for the study and no other significant incremental costs were identified with non routine updates that specifically addressed only year compliance 
based on currently available information  management does not believe the year matters discussed above related to internal systems or products sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or operations  however  it is uncertain to what extent the company may be affected by such matters 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year capability by a supplier or another third party would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of inflation management believes that  for the periods presented  inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the form of changes in foreign exchange rates and changes in the prices of marketable equity securities held as part of a deferred compensation plan a rabbi trust 
the company has approximately  translated from french francs at october  permanently invested in the assets of ideacod  sa  located in strasbourg  france 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate amounts to  which would not be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the rabbi trust assets  consisting of cash equivalents and debt and equity securities  are offset by an equivalent deferred compensation liability to the trust participants 
the liability fluctuates equally with changes in the value of the assets 
because the liability completely offsets the assets of the trust  changes in asset value have no effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
