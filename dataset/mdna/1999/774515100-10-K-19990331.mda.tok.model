in fiscal the company received net proceeds of million from a follow on common stock offering which were used primarily to reduce outstanding debt 
working capital is primarily used to support changes in accounts receivable and inventory as a result of the company s seasonal business cycle and business expansion 
these requirements are generally lowest in the months of january through march of each year and highest during the months of may through october of each year 
in addition  the company requires capital to support additions to machinery  equipment and facilities as well as the introduction of new footwear styles

year company s state of readiness the year yk issue refers to a condition in computer software where a two digit field instead of a four digit field is used to distinguish a calendar year 
unless corrected  date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions to various activities and operations 
such uncorrected conditions could significantly interfere with the conduct of the company s business  could result in disruption of its operations and could subject it to potentially significant legal liabilities 
the company is preparing for the consequences that yk may have on its ability to rely on data processing and other automated operational functions which are date dependent 
in addition  a questionnaire is being distributed to the company s vendors to obtain pertinent information and assurances that their systems and products are yk compliant 
finally  the company has internal non information technology systems comprised primarily of building security systems that need to be assessed for compliance 
it is expected that the assessment of the impact of the company s vendors systems and the company s non information technology system and its hardware will be complete by june the company will initiate testing of its internal hardware and software and upgrade or replace mission critical equipment as necessary to achieve compliance by june currently  the company is replacing its manufacturing and financial application software that is critical to the orderly conduct of the business 
the software upgrade is expected to be completed during the second quarter of management believes the company has completed an adequate assessment of yk dependencies relating to critical data processing 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s plan functions  and assessments have identified all existing yk expenses 
failure to identify all yk expenses could result in a materially adverse impact to the company  although the extent of this impact is not believed to be reasonably estimable 
costs to address year issues the company currently estimates that additional expenditures of approximately million  including hardware and software  will be made during fiscal to upgrade and enhance the company s systems 
as of december  the company s aggregate costs to date are approximately million related to computer hardware and software upgrades which were funded from current operations 
the anticipated impact and costs of the project  as well as the date on which the company expects to complete the project  are based on management s best estimates using information currently available and numerous assumptions about future events 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
risks of the company s year issues there can be no guarantee that the company s efforts will prevent a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial conditions and cash flows  since the company s yk compliance is dependent upon key third party vendors also being yk compliant on a timely basis 
the possible consequences to the company not being fully yk compliant include temporary plant closings  delays in the delivery of finished products  delays in the receipt of key materials and supplies  invoice and collection errors  and financing issues  including payroll 
these consequences could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows if the company is unable to conduct its business in the ordinary course 
the company s contingency plans the company is reviewing and plans to test all mission critical systems and major system components for yk compliance 
it is anticipated that these efforts will be completed by june the company plans to incorporate yk issues into its business contingency plans within this same timeframe 
worst case scenarios are being evaluated in relation to the company s key business needs 
the company has not yet adopted a formal contingency plan to address the possibility that internal  customer  or supplier systems may not become yk compliant  management will develop such plans which may be required as fiscal evolves and the risk of such exposure  if any  becomes better clarified 
specific timetables and phases will be established for these contingency plans 
the company cannot currently estimate the cost  if any  associated with contingency planning efforts that may be necessary to complete the yk efforts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
the company is also exposed to changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations 
however  commodity price risk related to the company s current commodities is not material as price changes in commodities are usually passed along to the final customer 
the company does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the company has the following three items that are market rate sensitive for interest rates long term debt consists of a credit facility with a balance at december  of  interest is payable monthly at the bank s libor rate plus to basis points or prime 
in order to minimize the effect of the interest rate fluctuation  the company has entered into two interest rate swap arrangements with a major bank for a total notional amount of  under these agreements the company pays a weighted average fixed rate of plus to basis points 
the company also has equipment and other obligations at december  that bear interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from to 
the company has a real estate obligation at december  that bears interest at a variable rate of 
assuming a hypothetical change in short term interest rates  interest expense would not change significantly  as the interest rate swap agreement would offset the impact
