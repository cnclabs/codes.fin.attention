item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth in this item below contains forward looking statements designated by an  and the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors  including those set forth above under additional risk factors 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and market innovative medical devices that utilize our proprietary rf technology for the treatment of upper airway disorders 
our somnoplastysm system provides physicians with a suite of products designed to offer minimally invasive  curative treatment alternatives for disorders of the upper airway  including obstructive sleep apnea osa  enlarged turbinates and snoring 
we have a limited history of operations that  to date  has consisted primarily of research and development  product engineering  seeking clearance of our products from the food drug administration fda  initial development of a direct sales force in the united states and internationally  and training international distributor employees for distribution of the somnoplasty system in the european union eu  australia  southeast asia and certain other areas 
we commercially introduced the somnoplasty system internationally  through medtronic  beginning in june one month later  after receiving k clearance from the fda for the use of the somnoplasty system to treat snoring  we began direct sales of the somnoplasty system in the united states 
we since received fda clearance to treat enlarged turbinates in december and osa in november during the third quarter of fiscal we terminated our relationship with medtronic and established a european headquarters in the netherlands 
this headquarters is responsible for 
establishing and managing relationships with key distributors throughout europe  
marketing the somnoplasty system throughout europe and 
providing clinical support 
product shipments are made directly from our facility in the united states to the distributor 
we have a distributor agreement in brazil and lois in several other countries 
we expect distribution agreements following these lois to be finalized within the first and second quarters of fiscal we also expect to continue to identify qualified distribution partners intensifying our coverage of europe 
in markets outside the united states and europe  we are in the process of establishing relationships with distributors that can provide us with access to an established network for the marketing and distribution of the somnoplasty system 
we have an agreement with a distributor in canada 
we plan to continue to hire additional management and engineering personnel to support and develop manufacturing expertise and larger scale manufacturing capacity expansion as required to support the current and anticipated growth 
additionally  we will invest in further production equipment  vertical integration and facility expansion to reduce manufacturing costs  reduce manufacturing cycle time and increase production capacity 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we commenced certain manufacturing facility expansion and improved layout for increased capacity  process improvement and quality control to support such growth 
personnel hires and capital expenditures will require operating capital on an ongoing basis 
we will continue to expand our internal reporting capabilities and further strengthen systems to manage our expanding business 
this current and anticipated significant growth of our personnel  sales and scope of operations may place considerable strain on our management  financial  manufacturing and other capabilities  procedures and controls 
there can be no assurance that any existing or additional capabilities  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our capabilities  procedures or controls will be designed  implemented or improved in a timely and cost effective manner 
failure to implement  improve and expand such capabilities  procedures and controls in an efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are building a direct sales force to cover the united states 
presently the sales force consists of a vice president of north american sales  two domestic regional sales managers  ten domestic sales representatives and one clinical specialist 
during fiscal we hired a vice president and general manager of european sales marketing and business managers to manage distributors in european countries 
medtronic previously distributed our products in europe 
somnus and medtronic have cooperatively transitioned product distribution rights back to somnus 
additionally  we have entered into an agreement with a distributor in canada and plan to enter into agreements for product distribution in japan and other international markets 
we anticipate significant short term expenditures in the development of our direct and indirect sales infrastructure 
as of december   we have incurred cumulative losses from inception of approximately  moreover  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over the next couple of years primarily due to the development of our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities along with ongoing research and development efforts  including clinical studies and expenses associated with our patent portfolio 
our limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
future revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year and will depend upon numerous factors  including the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  the scale up of manufacturing capabilities  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  competition  the timing and success of new product introductions by us or our competitors  the timing of regulatory clearances or approvals of those new products and the ability of us to market our products in the united states and internationally 
accordingly  interim period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of likely future performance or annual operating results 
our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected in the event that we are unable to market the somnoplasty system effectively  anticipate customer demand accurately or effectively manage new product launches  pricing and cost containment pressures in health care 
our operations and financial results could also be significantly affected by international factors  including oversight by numerous regulatory agencies  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign economic and political conditions 
results of operations net revenues our revenues for fiscal and fiscal are derived primarily from sales of our somnoplasty system  consisting of the rf and s control units and disposable devices  to private practices  hospitals  clinics and sleep clinics 
net revenues increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to the sale of control units  boosted by the introduction of the new s control unit during the third quarter and increased handpiece shipments driven off the higher installed base plus additional indications treatable with the somnoplasty system 
during fiscal our first full year of product shipments and  net revenues were attributable to sales to customers principally in the united states 
we expect that the sale of control units will continue to constitute a significant percentage of our total revenues in the near term as we build an installed base of users 
however  we expect disposable devices to increase as a percentage of total revenue  year over year 
manufacturing start up costs and costs of revenues 
manufacturing start up costs and costs of revenues increased  to  in fiscal from  in the prior year 
manufacturing start up costs and costs of revenues consist of raw materials  subassemblies and completed electronics  quality assurance and warranty costs 
the cost of product  salaries and employee related expenses  and the costs of establishing and expanding manufacturing capabilities  including a one time charge of approximately  relating to certain manufacturing process issues in the fourth quarter of fiscal  account for the majority of the increase from fiscal to fiscal we believe that manufacturing start up costs and costs of revenues will increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development costs for fiscal were  compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  
research and development expenses are comprised of salaries  prototype development costs  costs associated with intellectual property  and clinical trial and regulatory approval expenses 
the increase in expenses is primarily due to increased salaries and employee related expenses of  in fiscal versus  in the prior year  increased consulting fees of  compared to  increased patent legal expenses of  versus  in the prior year period and a higher level of general infrastructure costs  including facilities  information systems and quality assurance 
included in the employee related expenses is approximately  of non cash stock compensation charges resulting from stock option grants  compared to  for the prior year period 
these additional expenses were partially offset by lower spending on clinical trial and prototype costs of approximately  as compared to approximately  in the prior year period 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal an increase of approximately   or including approximately  in one time charges 
sg a expenses consist of executive salaries  professional fees including consulting  accounting  legal and risk management  facilities overhead  accounting and human resources and general office administration expenses 
the increase in sg a is primarily due to increased salaries and employee related expenses of  for fiscal  compared to  for the prior year period  due to increased headcount  higher levels of commission on higher sales volumes  the european office and one time charges of approximately  in connection with the transition of our former chief executive officer and chairman of the board to chief technical officer and board director  severance of our former chief financial officer and certain other executives 
these one time charges are comprised of approximately  in non cash stock compensation and approximately  of cash related compensation 
employee related expenses also include expenses of  increased from  for the prior year period relating to non cash stock compensation charges resulting from stock option grants including our executive employment status changes noted above and consultant awards 
increased selling expenses included commissions  travel and entertainment costs of  versus  for the prior year period and sales samples costs incurred in of  costs of development of marketing literature and campaigns  tradeshow attendance  and an extensive ongoing public relations effort to promote the somnoplasty system totaled approximately  in fiscal  compared to  for the prior year period 
interest and other income 
interest and other income for fiscal was  compared to  for the prior year period 
the increase is attributable to interest income earned by somnus on an increased outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents  invested from the proceeds of the ipo 
interest expense was  for fiscal  compared to  in the prior year period 
the decrease was due to the repayment of borrowings under the equipment lease line of credit 
net loss 
the net loss was  for fiscal and  for fiscal  respectively 
we expect that our operating losses will continue for at least the next couple of years and may increase in the short term  as we continue to invest substantial resources in product development  manufacturing and sales and marketing 
fiscal compared to the period from inception january  to december  net revenues 
our revenues through december  were derived from sales of our somnoplasty system  consisting of the rf control unit and sp and sp disposable devices now no longer commercially available  to private practices  hospitals  clinics and sleep clinics 
no revenues were recorded for the period from inception january  to december  fiscal 
for the year ended december  fiscal  net revenues  totaling  were attributable to sales to medtronic and  to other customers principally in the united states 
manufacturing start up costs and costs of revenues 
manufacturing start up costs and costs of revenues were  in fiscal and  in fiscal manufacturing start up costs and costs of revenues consist of raw materials  subassemblies and completed electronics  quality assurance and warranty costs 
the cost of purchased materials  the costs of prototypes  and the costs of establishing manufacturing capabilities account for the majority of the increase from fiscal to fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  in fiscal and  in fiscal research and development expenses are comprised of salaries  prototype development costs and clinical trial and regulatory approval expenses 
the increases between the comparison periods reflect the increased expenditures incurred in the development of the somnoplasty system  new development efforts for the control units and the disposable devices  initiation and expansion of clinical trials and expenses associated with regulatory approvals in the united states  the european union and australia 
clinical trial costs for fiscal were approximately  as compared to approximately  in fiscal salaries of research and development personnel represented  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
prototype and patent legal expenses increased to approximately  and  in fiscal  as compared to  and in fiscal  respectively 
the expenses also include approximately  of non cash stock compensation charges resulting from stock option grants 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  in fiscal and  in fiscal  respectively 
sg a expenses consist of executive salaries  professional fees  facilities overhead  accounting and human resources  general office administration expenses such as rent and facility costs 
sg a for fiscal included legal and accounting costs of approximately  and professional recruitment costs and other consultant fees of  the expenses also include  of non cash stock compensation charges resulting from stock option grants 
the increase between the comparison periods reflects the hiring of additional personnel  increased legal  accounting and insurance costs associated with being a public company  development of marketing literature and campaigns  an extensive public relations effort to promote the somnoplasty system in conjunction with the product launch in june and additional market research into new product areas 
the costs of public relations and advertising for the fiscal were approximately  interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net were  in fiscal and  for fiscal the increases were attributable to interest income earned by somnus on our outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents  invested from the proceeds of the series c issuance and the ipo  net of interest expense on our lease line of credit obligations 
interest expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase was due to increased borrowings against the equipment lease line of credit 
income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
we also had federal and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in the year through  if not utilized 
the state of california net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards before becoming available to reduce our federal income tax liabilities 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately  which have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
deferred tax assets relate primarily to the net operating loss carryforwards 
year compliance many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
as a result  software that records only the last two digits of the calendar year may not be able to distinguish whether means or this may result in software failures or the creation of erroneous results 
we have assessed and continue to assess our exposure to the year problem 
we believe our enterprise resource planning systems and networking systems are compliant and we are upgrading our telecommunications systems for year compliance 
we also believe that our products are year compliant 
however  while we believe we have made significant progress in resolving known year issues  sufficient testing has not been completed to fully validate the readiness of our systems and products 
additional testing and upgrades are planned during fiscal to reasonably ensure year compliance for our operations 
we have also assessed and continue to assess the possible effect on our operations of the year readiness of critical suppliers of products and services 
our reliance on our key suppliers  and therefore on the proper functioning of their information systems and software  is increasing 
we are in the process of contacting critical suppliers to gain assurance of their year readiness 
however  there can be no assurance all of these suppliers will be year compliant and their failure to address year issues could have an adverse effect on us 
although it is difficult to estimate the total year project costs  our preliminary estimate is that such costs will total between approximately  and  which is not material to our business operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
we have incurred approximately  through december  on this project 
the expenses of the year project are being funded from existing cash reserves and through operating cash flows 
somnus has not developed a formal comprehensive contingency plan to address situations that may result if we are unable to achieve year readiness of our operations 
these contingency plans will be for certain mission critical operations for the period immediately subsequent to january  and will be formalized during the first half of fiscal there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop a contingency plan that will adequately address issues that may arise in the year our failure to develop and implement  if necessary  an appropriate contingency plan could have a material impact on our operations 
finally  we are also vulnerable to external forces that might generally affect industry and commerce  such as utility or transportation year compliance failures and related service interruptions 
we believe that we are unlikely to experience a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to year compliance issues within our operations 
however  since the assessment process is ongoing  year compliance complications are not fully known  critical suppliers of components  services and others including utility companies are outside our control  and potential liability issues are not clear  the full potential impact of the year on us is not known at this time 
liquidity and capital resources since inception through december   somnus has financed our operations primarily through the private placement of equity securities  bank loans  lease lines of credit  stockholder loans and our november ipo 
from inception  we raised approximately  in net proceeds from private equity financing 
we raised an additional  from our ipo  net of costs of  cash and cash equivalents at december  were  compared to  at december  net cash used in operating activities was approximately  for the twelve months ended december   compared to  for the prior year period 
net cash used in operating activities differs from our net loss for these comparison periods primarily due to non cash charges associated with the amortization of deferred compensation  the depreciation of property and equipment  and the increase in accounts payable and related accruals 
these sources of funds were offset partially by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory  as we increase sales of our products and move more of the manufacturing operations in house 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately  for the twelve months ended december   compared to  for the prior year period  the net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to capital expenditures during these periods 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for the twelve months ended december  and  for the prior year period 
net cash provided by financing activities in is attributable primarily to the exercise of options 
the net cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended december  included primarily the issuance of preferred stock  borrowings under a lease line of credit and proceeds from our ipo 
we recorded deferred stock compensation expense for the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock for certain options granted and related to the severance of former executives including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer 
the total unamortized deferred stock compensation at december  is  we amortized deferred compensation expenses of approximately  in the twelve months ended december  compared to  for the respective period 
the remainder of the deferred stock compensation will be amortized over the corresponding vesting period of each respective option  which is generally four years from date of original issuance 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of  in cash and cash equivalents 
there were no other material unused sources of liquid assets at december  we currently anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements will be approximately million for the next twelve months 
these requirements relate primarily to the acquisition of computer hardware and software and for additional leasehold improvements to handle anticipated manufacturing expansion and headcount additions 
in october  we announced that our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program permitting the purchase of up to  shares  at up to per share  of our common stock in the open market 
no shares had been repurchased by somnus as of december  subsequently somnus has repurchased a nominal number of shares under the program 
we anticipate that our existing resources will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations at least through the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding prior to such time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the ability of somnus to establish and maintain strategic distributor relationships  the time and cost in obtaining regulatory clearances  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing and other factors 
there can be no assurance that additional financing to meet our funding requirements will be available as needed 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
insufficient funds may require somnus to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish rights to products at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise seek to obtain 
the failure of somnus to raise capital when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shift in the interest rates we invest in short term securities and have maintained an average maturity of months or less 
due to the nature of short term investments we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure
