based on its current operating plan  the company believes that its cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  cash flows from operations and current available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflationary increases in costs have not been material in recent years and  to the extent permitted by competitive pressures  are passed on to the clients through increased billing rates 
rates charged by the company are based on the cost of labor and market conditions within the industry 
the company was able to increase its billing rates over its increases in direct labor in this is due primarily to our increase in client strategic services in which competition is less and the quality of services commands higher rates 
year issues overview the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
keane s computer equipment and software and devices with embedded technology that are time sensitive may recognize as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of keane s operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to perform mission critical functions like billing and time reporting 
as a result  software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to ensure that they accept four digit date codes 
state of readiness company services and products 
keane generally delivers services and not products to its customers 
the company believes that the services provided by its professionals to its customers are provided in a year compliant manner 
keane s healthcare solutions practice develops  markets and sells software products 
certain of these products are not fully year operable 
keane has advised its customer base for these products that it does not intend to offer year compliant versions of these products and has encouraged them to migrate to new products offered by keane that are year ready 
the company anticipates that some customers will choose not to migrate to these products and will therefore terminate their relationship with keane s healthcare solutions practice 
the exact amount of anticipated lost customers has not been determined 
the company believes that the revenue lost as a result of these events will be immaterial to its overall operations 
in addition to its own products  keane markets certain third party software products through its healthcare solutions practice 
the company is seeking assurances from the vendors of these products that all licensed software is year compliant 
the company has received substantially all of these assurances in the first quarter of company systems 
keane has established a year task force that has completed its assessment of the company s information technology related it related systems for the year issue 
for it related systems  the company believes that most of the critical systems  including its accounting software  as applications and payroll systems  are now year compliant 
however  keane s federal systems subsidiary uses a software product for its accounting system that is not year compliant 
the vendor for this product has advised the company that it plans to release a year compliant upgrade for its product in the first quarter of the company is in the process of replacing its billing software because the current software product is not year compliant 
the cost to replace this software is currently estimated to be approximately  keane believes that the new software will be operational by the end of the first quarter of keane s year task force is also evaluating the company s non it systems  including alarm systems  sprinkler systems  elevators  fax machines and other miscellaneous systems that may contain embedded technology  for the year issue 
keane expects to complete its identification and assessment of year issues in non it systems in and to establish a remediation plan to address any outstanding year issues concerning the company s non it systems 
costs to address year issues keane anticipates that it will incur direct costs to modify or replace existing systems used by keane in the operation of its business to ensure that all systems will be operable in the year  including the costs to replace its billing software described above 
the company believes that the total amounts spent by it to date and that it expects to spend in addressing the year issue are not material 
risks to the company in the event of a failure of some or all of the company s it related and non it systems on january   the company s operations may be substantially curtailed until the company or its third party suppliers develop a solution to address such system s failure 
in such event  the company may be unable to a perform billing functions  b keep track of time performed on projects for its clients  c access client records  d communicate between field offices and headquarters  e operate its internet site  f receive and send email or g prepare its financial statements for the fourth quarter of or periods thereafter 
among the services that keane provides are assessment  planning  migration remediation and testing services for year compliance 
keane has devoted significant resources to services that address the year problem and believes the market for these services will decline as the year approaches 
although keane believes that the demand for its services relating to the year problem will continue to exist after the year  this demand will diminish significantly over time and will eventually disappear 
keane s services addressing the year problem involve key aspects of its clients computer systems 
a failure in a client s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against keane  regardless of keane s responsibility for the failure 
keane could incur substantial costs in connection with any resulting litigation  regardless of the outcome 
contingency plans as described above  the company has identified potential vulnerabilities associated with the change of the century 
the company is devoting resources to working with providers of systems to the company to ensure that its business is not substantially interrupted as a result of the date change 
the company currently does not have a contingency plan in the event of a particular system not being year compliant 
such a plan will be developed if it becomes clear that the company is not going to achieve its scheduled compliance objectives 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
fluctuations in operating results 
keane has experienced and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its quarterly results 
keane s gross margins vary based on a variety of factors including employee utilization rates and the number and type of services performed by keane during a particular period 
a variety of factors influence keane s revenue in a particular quarter  including general economic conditions which may influence investment decisions or cause downsizing  the number and requirements of client engagements  employee utilization rates  changes in the rates keane can charge clients for services  acquisitions  and other factors  many of which are beyond keane s control 
a significant portion of keane s expenses do not vary relative to revenue 
as a result  if revenue in a particular quarter does not meet expectations  keane s operating results could be materially adversely affected  which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the market price of keane common stock 
in addition  many of keane s engagements are terminable without client penalty 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in an increase in underutilized employees and a decrease in revenue and profits 
risks relating to acquisitions 
in the past five years  keane has grown significantly through acquisitions 
since january   keane has completed the acquisitions of quantum associates  inc d b a omega systems in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  gse erudite systems in salt lake city  utah  bricker associates  inc in chicago  illinois  icom systems ltd in birmingham  england  fourth tier  inc in el segundo  california  emergent corporation in san mateo  california and advanced solutions inc in new york  new york 
keane s future growth may be based in part on selected acquisitions 
at any given time  keane may be in various stages of considering such opportunities 
keane can provide no assurances that it will be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or that it will be successful in entering into a definitive agreement with any one target 
also  even if a definitive agreement is reached  there is no assurance that any future acquisition will be completed 
keane typically anticipates that each acquisition will bring certain benefits  such as an increase in revenue 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if such benefits can actually be realized 
accordingly  there is a risk that an acquired company may not achieve an increase in revenue or other benefits for keane 
in addition  an acquisition may result in unexpected costs and expenses 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the process of integrating acquired companies into keane s existing business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention which keane might otherwise devote to its existing business 
also  the process may require significant financial resources that keane might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of keane s existing operations 
finally  future acquisition could result in keane having to incur additional debt and or contingent liabilities 
all of these possibilities might have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition and result of operations 
dependence on personnel 
keane believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense 
keane may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to develop its business 
if keane does not  its business  financial condition and result of operations could be materially adversely affected 
highly competitive market 
the market for keane s services is highly competitive 
the technology for custom software services can change rapidly 
the market is fragmented  and no company holds a dominant position 
consequently  keane s competition for client assignments and experienced personnel varies significantly from city to city and by the type of service provided 
some of keane s competitors are larger and have greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition in the markets they serve than does keane 
in addition  clients may elect to increase their internal information systems resources to satisfy their custom software development needs 
keane believes that in order to compete successfully in the software services industry it must be able to compete cost effectively  develop strong client relationships  generate recurring revenues  utilize comprehensive delivery methodologies  and achieve organizational learning by implementing standard operational processes 
in the healthcare software systems market  keane competes with some companies that are larger in the healthcare market and have greater financial resources than keane 
keane believes that significant competitive factors in the healthcare software systems market include size and demonstrated ability to provide service to targeted healthcare markets 
keane may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures faced by keane may materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
year compliance  risks associated with provision of year services 
keane has reviewed its internal computer systems and has identified certain internal systems that are not year compatible ie  such systems use only two digits to represent the year in date data fields and  consequently  may not accurately distinguish between the th and st centuries or may not function properly at the turn of the century 
keane is in the process of correcting these systems or replacing them with year compliant systems 
keane expects to implement successfully the systems and programming changes necessary to address year issues and does not believe that the cost of such actions will have a material effect on keane s financial condition or results of operations 
there may  however  be a delay in  or increased costs associated with  the implementation of these changes 
keane s inability to implement changes could have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition or results of operations 
among the services that keane provides are assessment  planning  migration remediation and testing services for year compliance 
keane has devoted significant resources to services that address the year problem and believes the market for these services will decline as the year approaches 
although keane believes that the demand for its services relating to the year problem will continue to exist after the year  this demand will diminish significantly over time and will eventually disappear 
keane s services addressing the year problem involve key aspects of its clients computer systems 
a failure in a client s system could result in a claim for substantial damages against keane  regardless of keane s responsibility for the failure 
keane could incur substantial costs in connection with any resulting litigation  regardless of the outcome 
international operations 
in august  keane commenced operations in the united kingdom with its acquisition of icom systems ltd  now known as keane limited 
keane s international operations will be subject to political and economic uncertainties  currency exchange rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  changes in taxation and other difficulties in managing operations overseas 
keane may not be successful in its international operations 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
keane believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and it expects that results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future
