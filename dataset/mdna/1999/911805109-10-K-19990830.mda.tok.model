liquidity and capital resources at may  during fiscal  cash and cash equivalents increased by  to a balance of  at may  cash increases came primarily as a result of the receipt of cash from the settlement of various sheep mountain partners smp arbitration litigation issues  the collection of accounts and notes receivable  the sale of certain assets and the consolidation of yellow stone fuels corp 
ysfc 
cash was provided from operations and financing activities of  and  respectively 
cash of  was used in investing activities 
the company received two payments as partial settlement of various disputes existing between the partners of smp 
the first payment of  which was recorded as an account receivable at may   represented matters which the partners of smp agreed to settle based on the april  order and award which was rendered by the arbitration panel and confirmed by the us district court of colorado 
the company received an additional payment of  after a decision was reached by the th circuit court of appeals  which affirmed the second amended judgment of the us district court of colorado  without modification 
during the twelve months ended may   accounts receivable from affiliates decreased by  this reduction came primarily as a result of green mountain mining venture gmmv reducing the amount it owed the company for operations at the gmmv uranium properties by  and payment of accounts receivable from ysfc of  the company also received its final payment of  plus interest of  on a three year installment promissory note of  as a result of the sale of the brunton company in fiscal to a third party 
ysfc was consolidated beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the consolidation of ysfc  cash increased by  cash was used to reduce accounts payable and accrued expenses by   reduce debt by  purchase and renovate assets   purchase treasury stock   and fund continuing operations 
during fiscal  proceeds from long term debt were  the net decrease in long term debt of  was primarily the result of scheduled debt payments  net of purchases of additional mineral properties by sutter gold mining company sgmc   and the purchase of additional equipment   other subsidiaries of the company consumed cash and obtained financing to purchase additional equipment and construct or renovate existing facilities 
additions to the capital equipment and facilities at the commercial operations in southern utah included the partial construction of a boat storage facility   renovations to the plateau resources limited plateau motel and c store facilities in southern utah   and the purchase of vehicles  mobile homes and other equipment  airport operations in wyoming underwent a  renovation to its fuel storage facility 
other capital expenditures included the purchase of various pieces of equipment for  these purchases of capital equipment were offset by the sale of various equipment which generated  in cash proceeds 
capital resources general the primary source of the company s capital resources for fiscal will be cash on hand at may   cash generated from commercial operations in southern utah  possible equity financing for the company and its affiliated companies  and the expected final resolution of the smp arbitration 
the company will also continue to offer for sale various other assets such as lots and homes in ticaboo  utah  real estate holdings in wyoming  colorado and utah and various mineral interests 
advance royalties  interest  rentals of real estate holdings and equipment  aircraft chartering and aviation fuel sales will also provide cash 
line of credit the company has a  line of credit with a commercial bank 
the line of credit is secured by various real estate holdings and equipment belonging to the company 
this facility is currently available to the company 
it is anticipated that this line of credit may be used to finance working capital needs 
financing equity financings for sgmc  plateau and ysfc are dependent on the market price of gold and uranium  among other things 
currently  the prices for these metals are depressed and it is not known when they will recover 
management of the company believes  based on its analysis of independent projections  that the market prices for these metals will improve in the future 
no assurance can be given that the prices will improve during fiscal if the prices do not improve  the ability of the company to raise equity financing will be impaired 
the company believes that cash on hand  its line of credit and cash projected to be received from operations  along with potential cut backs in capital development  general and administrative and operating expenses  will be adequate to fund working capital requirements through fiscal these capital resources are not sufficient to provide the necessary funding for major capital expenditures of the company s mineral properties and  accordingly  the company s development plans may be either temporarily or permanently impacted 
the company issued shares of its common stock to various individuals and employee benefit plans which conserved its cash during fiscal the issuances of shares included  shares of common stock were issued to fund the obligation to the employee stock ownership plan which accounted for compensation expense of   shares to an outside consultant  for services over a two year period  which created an expense in fiscal of  and deferred expenses of  which will be amortized over a month period   shares of restricted common stock each to two of its employees for their extraordinary time and expertise that was devoted to the company resulting in the successful efforts of the company in the smp arbitration litigation 
these shares were valued at market for which the company recorded an expense of   shares of common stock issued to outside directors for services rendered which were valued at   shares  which are forfeitable under the stock award program  valued at  which will be amortized over a five year period  and the issuance of  purchase warrants to outside consultants  for services over a one to two year period  which have a value of  that will be amortized over a month period 
the company will continue to fund employee retirement and bonus plans and outside director s fees with its common stock 
these changes in components of working capital along with minor increases in accounts and notes receivable trade   assets held for resale and other assets   and inventory of  resulted in a net decrease in working capital of  to working capital at may  of  it is anticipated that this working capital along with the line of credit and cash received from operations  as well as reductions in capital expenditures and general and administrative and operational costs  will be sufficient to supply the working capital needs of the company during fiscal until either the remaining smp arbitration issue is resolved or equity financing is raised  the company plans to curtail major development projects on its mineral properties  general and administrative expenses and commercial operations 
capital requirements general the primary requirements for the company s working capital during fiscal are expected to be associated with corporate general and administrative expenses and care and maintenance costs of plateau  smp  ysfc and sgmc mineral properties 
the company will also be responsible for the purchase of uranium for a delivery pursuant to the one utility contract that was assigned to the company as a result of the partial settlement agreement reached with nukem  inc in the smp arbitration 
it is not anticipated that the net gain or loss on the delivery to this uranium contract will be material to the net income of the company during fiscal sgmc during fiscal and  the company issued  and  shares  respectively  of its common stock to purchase  and  special warrant units respectively from certain sgmc investors in an arm s length  bargained transaction 
the transaction resulted in the company increasing its ownership of sgmc by to of the outstanding common stock of sgmc as of may  the company continually evaluates carrying values of its long lived assets 
due to various market related factors  the market price for gold was pushed to year lows 
as a result of the continuing decline in the market price of gold  the company recorded impairments of  and  in fiscal and respectively on its sgmc mineral assets 
management of the company currently plans to maintain the property in a care and maintenance mode until the price of gold rebounds 
preliminary estimates are that the proposed mine mill operation will require approximately  to place the proposed mine and mill into full operation 
the company will need to obtain these funds from either an equity partner  the equity market or commercial borrowings prior to the sgmc properties going into production 
the company is also exploring alternative uses for the property  including tourism 
smp the company is responsible for all care and maintenance costs of the smp properties 
during fiscal these costs averaged  per month 
there are no current plans to mine the smp crooks gap properties during fiscal however  the company will continue to preserve the mineral properties and evaluate concepts to reduce care and maintenance costs 
all matters in the smp arbitration have been settled with the exception of the resolution of the constructive trust which was impressed by the arbitration panel on several supply contracts with three republics of the former soviet union 
the existence of a constructive trust on the contracts was confirmed by the u 
s 
district court of colorado and affirmed by the th circuit court of appeals 
management believes that the resolution of the constructive trust issue will occur during fiscal however  no assurance of the resolution or its ultimate impact on the financial condition or earnings of the company can be predicted 
gmmv pursuant to an acquisition agreement that was signed on june   kennecott paid the company million upon execution of the agreement  which became non refundable upon the satisfaction of certain terms 
due to continued depressed market prices for uranium concentrates the company was unsuccessful in obtaining financing which would have allowed the company to purchase kennecott s interest in the gmmv 
the million advanced at closing is classified as a deferred purchase option and will be offset against any future cash commitments the company may incur on the gmmv properties 
during july  the gmmv management committee unanimously agreed to place the jackpot mine and sweetwater mill on active standby status 
this decision was made as a result of uncertainties in the short term uranium market 
during fiscal  the company elected under the original gmmv agreement to become a non participating partner in the budgets of the gmmv 
this decision by the company will have a dilutive effect on its ownership in the gmmv 
the company can buy back any dilution it may suffer in its ownership under certain conditions of the gmmv contract 
the company believes that due to significantly reduced annual care and maintenance costs  the dilution of its interest will be minor in the short term 
as a result of continued depressed uranium prices  the decision to curtail development activities and lack of funding gmmv took an impairment against its mineral assets 
this impairment does not affect the company s carrying value of its investment in gmmv or its results of operations 
plateau in addition to maintaining the mill and mine properties  plateau owns and operates the ticaboo townsite  motel  convenience store and restaurant 
operations in fiscal resulted in a loss of  this loss is a reduction of approximately  from the loss experienced in fiscal in addition to commercial operations  plateau is developing real estate sales on developed home and trailer sites as well as constructed homes 
the company is currently working to obtain the necessary permits from the nrc and state of utah to place the shootaring mill  which is owned by plateau and located in southern utah into production 
the company is seeking debt or equity financing of between  to  to put the mill and tony m 
mine into production 
until such time as the market price for uranium concentrates reaches economic levels  financing is obtained and profitable contracts are secured  the company will not put the properties into production 
plateau is also evaluating alternate uses for its mill site including a disposal site for low level radioactive material 
ysfc during fiscal the company issued  shares of its common stock in an exchange with private investors in ysfc pursuant to an exchange agreement in a private placement of ysfc stock 
due to the acquisition of substantially all the outside shareholder s interest  the company began consolidating ysfc on march  the company recorded an impairment on its ysfc mineral assets  during fiscal due to continued depressed market prices for uranium concentrates 
ysfc retained its properties and anticipates placing them into production at such time as they become economical 
no prediction can be made when the market price for uranium concentrates will recover to the level that the ysfc properties will be economical to produce 
term debt and other obligations debt is primarily for land and equipment purchased by sgmc  the company  and fng 
the debt bears various interest rates and is due under various payment terms 
it is anticipated that all debt payments will be able to be made in the normal course of the company s business 
reclamation obligations it is not anticipated that any of the company s working capital will be used in fiscal for the reclamation of any of its mineral properties 
the reclamation costs are long term and are either bonded through the use of cash bonds or the pledge of assets 
it is not anticipated that any of the company s mining properties will enter the reclamation phase prior to may  at may   all reclamation obligations of the company were fully covered by cash  bonds  the pledge of real estate assets  or in the case of gmmv  surety bonds posted by kennecott 
the company evaluates all reclamation liabilities annually with the responsible regulatory agency 
when increases are required  provisions are made in the cash deposits or bonding 
other the company is not using hazardous substances or known pollutants to any great degree in these activities 
consequently  recurring costs for managing hazardous substances  and capital expenditures for monitoring hazardous substances or pollutants have not been significant 
likewise  the company does not have properties which require current remediation 
the company is not aware of any claims for personal injury or property damages that need to be accrued or funded 
the tax years through may  are closed after audit by the irs 
the company currently has filed a request for an appeal hearing on an irs agent s findings for the years ended may  and no assurance of the outcome of the appeal can be given 
however  management of the company believes that the results of the appeal will not have a material affect on the financial position of the company 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal although the company experienced positive cash flows during fiscal  operations resulted in a net loss after taxes of  or per share as compared to a loss of  or per share in fiscal decreased revenue and the impairment of mineral assets are the primary cause for the increase in the fiscal loss 
revenues mineral sales decreased by  during fiscal this decrease resulted from no revenues recognized during fiscal from a smp base escalated uranium delivery contract  which generated revenues of  during fiscal from the final delivery under the contract 
there were reduced revenues from the advance royalty from cyprus amax of  due to reduced market prices for molybdenum 
these decreases in mineral sales revenue were slightly offset by net profits received from one of the smp purchase contracts of  during fiscal while no such revenues were recorded in fiscal commercial operations revenues decreased by  this decrease occurred primarily as a result of reduced equipment rentals to the gmmv 
the gmmv properties were on a standby basis during most of fiscal due to reduced uranium prices 
this decrease of equipment rental of  was offset by increased fuel sales at the company s southern utah commercial operations of oil sales decreased by  as a result of temporarily closing down oil production due to continued depressed market prices for crude oil and a continuing decline in the production of the oil wells 
subsequent to may  the company began producing from two of the oil wells 
the company will continue to evaluate future production based on estimated production rates and market prices for crude oil 
management fees and other revenues decreased by  primarily due to reduced contract work performed at the gmmv properties and management services at the smp properties 
the company is paid a percentage of all costs at the gmmv properties for contract services provided 
during fiscal  operations were significantly reduced at the gmmv properties  which reduced the related management fees 
upon receiving the smp mining properties in a partial settlement of the smp arbitration issues  the company was no longer entitled to management fees on the smp properties 
costs and expenses mineral operations increased from  during fiscal to  during fiscal this increase of  primarily related to care and maintenance costs associated with the smp properties 
the company became responsible for of these costs at the beginning of fiscal due to a partial settlement of the smp arbitration litigation issues which conveyed ownership of the smp mining properties to the company 
general and administrative expenses increased from  during fiscal by  to  during fiscal this increase was a result of the consolidation of sgmc for the full year of fiscal of  the consolidation of ysfc for the fourth quarter of   and the amortization of warrants granted to consultants of  and deferred compensation of  the largest increases in costs and expenses were impairments in mineral assets and provision for doubtful accounts 
during fiscal  the company recorded a total impairment on mineral assets of  as compared to an impairment on mineral assets of  for fiscal the impairment in fiscal  consisted of an impairment of the sgmc assets of  and the ysfc assets of  the impairment of the sgmc and ysfc assets related primarily to mineral properties and equipment 
the company also recognized non cash expenses in the form of a provision for doubtful accounts of  and the write off of an investment made in a non affiliated company during fiscal of  the provision for doubtful accounts is a result of the continual inability of a third party to pay amounts due the company on real estate sold in prior years 
the company will pursue collection of these amounts 
fiscal compared to fiscal operations resulted in a net after tax loss of  or per share as compared to a net after tax loss of  or per share 
the primary cause of this reduction in the company s loss during fiscal were increased revenues of  while costs and expenses only increased by  net cash used in operating activities decreased to  in from  in primarily due to the decrease in loss from operations offset by other working capital changes 
revenues mineral revenues increased by  as the result of the company receiving its proportionate share of the net proceeds from the delivery of pounds of uranium under an smp contract 
this was the last delivery under this contract and no similar delivery proceeds were received during fiscal commercial operations revenue increased by  as a result of an increase of  pertaining to increased equipment rentals to the gmmv and the development of mining properties 
additionally  revenues generated at the company s ticaboo townsite increased by  in fiscal smp litigation settlements are recorded net of any accounts receivable from smp for holding costs of the mining properties 
during fiscal  such revenues increased by a net of  to  construction contract revenues decreased by  as a result of the company s subsidiary four nines gold  inc fng not obtaining any commercial construction contracts 
fng s equipment and employees were used exclusively during fiscal on the construction of various roads  ponds and other excavation projects for the gmmv 
revenues from management fees increased significantly due to the work that was done under the gmmv agreements that allow the company to receive a management fee on all billable charges under the gmmv agreement 
costs and expenses mineral operation expenses and general and administrative expenses increased by  and  respectively due to increased operations at the company s gmmv and plateau mineral and commercial operations  and increased salary expense 
the company recognized a mineral interest impairment of  pertaining to sgmc as discussed above 
there was no impairment of mineral properties taken during fiscal there was however an abandonment of mining claims in pertaining to certain mining claims in the amount of  no abandonments of mining claims occurred in fiscal construction costs decreased by  due to fng not performing any commercial construction work  and provision for doubtful accounts decreased by  as no additional provision was required 
future operations the company has generated losses in each of the last three years  as a result of holding costs and permitting activities in the mineral segment along with impairments of mineral assets 
the company is in the process of holding its investments in gold and uranium properties that are currently not generating any operating revenues 
these properties require expenditures for items such as permitting  care and maintenance  holding fees  corporate overhead and administrative expenses 
success in the minerals industry is dependant on the price that a company can receive for the minerals produced 
the company cannot predict what the long term price for gold and uranium will be and therefore cannot predict when  or if  the company will generate net income from operations 
the company has sufficient capital resources to maintain its mineral properties on a stand by basis through fiscal development activities of the mineral properties and expansion of commercial operations are dependant on the company obtaining equity financing or commercial loans 
in addition  legal expenses associated with the litigation and arbitration surrounding the smp partnership and the inability of the company to utilize all the funds that have been awarded to the company by the arbitration panel and confirmed by the federal courts have compounded the company s operating and cash flow position in the past 
the company believes that the smp arbitration litigation will be resolved during fiscal year issue computer programs written in the past utilize a two digit format to identify the applicable year 
any date sensitive software beyond december  could fail  if not modified 
the result could be  among other possibilities  disruptions to operations and the inability to process financial transactions 
the company has evaluated the operating systems on all headquarter and field office computers and operating systems and has consulted with its vendors of the computer software which is being used by the company and its affiliates 
the vendors have confirmed to the company that all of the company s software and information systems are year compliant 
the company therefore does not believe that significant expenditures will be required for the year event 
in the event that the company experiences technical problems because of the year problem it will change software vendors 
such a change would not have a material affect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
effects of changes in prices mining operations and the acquisition  development and sale of mineral properties are significantly affected by changes in commodity prices 
as prices for a particular mineral increase  prices for prospects for that mineral also increase  making acquisitions of such properties costly  and sales advantageous 
conversely  a price decline facilitates acquisitions of properties containing that mineral  but makes sales of such properties more difficult 
operational impacts of changes in mineral commodity prices are common in the mining industry 
uranium and gold 
changes in the prices of uranium and gold affect the company to the greatest extent 
currently  both gold and uranium are at historical low prices 
the company is continually evaluating market trends and data 
the company does not plan to go forward with any additional development of its mineral properties until the market price for gold and uranium obtain and remain at higher levels which will make the operations profitable 
molybdenum and oil 
changes in prices of molybdenum and petroleum are not expected to materially affect the company with respect to either its molybdenum advance royalties or its fees associated with oil production 
a significant and sustained increase in demand for molybdenum would be required for the development of the mt 
emmons properties by cyprus amax since cyprus amax has other producing mines
