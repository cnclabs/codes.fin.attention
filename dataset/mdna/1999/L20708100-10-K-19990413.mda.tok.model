item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial and statistical information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
general the company generates revenues by leasing to ocean carriers marine containers that are owned either by third party container owners or by the company itself 
these leases  which generate most of the company s revenues  are generally operating leases 
the segment information presented in note of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements relates to the portions of the company s fleet owned by the company itself owned containers or by the company s managed container programs  us public limited partnerships us limited partnerships and other container owners other container owners and together with us limited partnerships  managed container owners 
owned containers include containers held for resale  the financing costs of which are borne by the company prior to the sale of such containers to managed container owners  and are accounted for in the owned container segment 
the company bears the risk of ownership with respect to containers in owned containers but not with respect to the majority of containers in the managed container owners segments  although the company bears the risk that the management agreements could be terminated  resulting in the removal of the corresponding managed containers from the fleet 
at december   approximately  and of the company s fleet by original equipment cost was related to us limited partnerships  other container owners and owned containers  respectively 
all containers  whether owned or managed  are operated as part of a single fleet 
the company has discretion over which ocean carriers  container manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services it deals with 
since the company s management agreements with the managed container owners meet the definition of leases in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 they are accounted for in the company s financial statements as leases under which the container owners are lessors and the company is lessee 
the agreements with container owners generally provide that the company will make payments to the container owners based upon the rentals collected from ocean carriers after deducting direct operating expenses and a management fee 
substantially all payments to container owners are therefore contingent upon the leasing of the containers by the company to ocean carriers and the collection of lease rentals 
minimum lease payments on the minority of the cronos group agreements which have fixed payment terms are presented in note c of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
substantially all payments to container owners represent a percentage of the rentals collected from the ocean carriers to whom containers are leased by the company 
gross lease revenue represents revenue from operating leases  excluding billings in advance 
these amounts are billed in us dollars on a monthly basis 
amounts due under master leases are calculated by the company at the end of each month and billed approximately to days thereafter 
amounts due under short term and long term leases are set forth in the respective lease agreements and are generally payable monthly 
changes in gross lease revenue depend primarily upon fleet growth  utilization rates and average per diem rates 
the company has expanded its fleet since december  from  teu to  teu at december  between and the owned and managed fleets have grown from  teu to  teu and from  teu to  teu  respectively 
during this period  the company added containers having an original equipment cost of million and million  respectively  net of disposals  to its owned and managed fleet  increasing the total original equipment cost of the fleet to million 
during and the ability of the company to purchase new equipment for both the owned and managed fleets was constrained by the levels of finance available to the company 
utilization of the company s containers declined in as a result of the increasing fleet size  an oversupply of containers in the industry  relatively slow growth in world trade and increased competition 
during  utilization experienced steady growth due to marketing efforts and improved inventory management 
in  utilization declined reflecting the deteriorating economic position in asian  south american and other markets 
the company s average per diem rates have fallen consistently throughout  and this reflects the rationalization in the global shipping industry and the resultant lowering of freight rates 
commissions  fees and other operating income includes acquisition fees relating to the company s managed container programs  syndication fees relating to the company s limited partnership offerings  income from direct financing leases principally containers leased under lease purchase arrangements  fees from the disposal of used containers and miscellaneous other fees and income 
this item is affected by the size of new managed programs  the purchase price of containers purchased for new managed programs  the number and value of direct financing leases and income from disposals of used containers 
although acquisition fees are generally received in cash at the inception of a managed container program and are non refundable  they are amortized in the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the managed container agreement to which they relate 
direct operating expenses are direct costs associated with leasing containers  both owned and managed 
these expenses include depot costs such as repairs  maintenance  handling and storage  non depot expenses such as insurance  agent fees and repositioning costs  and other expenses such as provisions for doubtful accounts and legal costs 
direct operating expenses are affected primarily by fleet size and utilization 
the majority of direct operating expenses relate to off hire containers  and therefore these costs are sensitive to the quantity of off hire containers as well as the frequency at which containers are re delivered 
payments to container owners reflect the amounts due to managed container owners  computed in accordance with the terms of the individual agreements 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all employee and office costs  professional fees and computer systems costs 
operating profit or loss includes items directly attributable to specific containers in each of the company s operating segments  as well as items not attributable to any specific container but instead are allocated across operating segments 
items directly attributable to operating segments include gross lease revenues  direct the cronos group operating costs  payments to container owners  container interest and depreciation expense 
indirect items allocated across segments include selling  general and administrative expenses  interest  depreciation and impairment charges on the company s non container assets 
results of operations the following chart represents certain key performance measurements  expressed as a percentage of gross lease revenue year ended december  direct operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization interest expense depreciation and amortization in includes the amortization of goodwill on the acquisition of capital stock of an affiliate 
in the income statement data  this amortization is netted in calculating equity in earnings of affiliates

based on current market conditions and expected new container prices in  the company intends to allocate the majority of its production funding to new dry cargo containers  and the balance to dry freight specials and tank containers 
the majority of new funding in is expected to come from the other container owner segment  most of which is expected to be used for new production  with the balance targeted to purchase used containers currently owned by the company 
operating profit  see note to the consolidated financial statements  from us limited partnerships declined by approximately million  or  from million in to million in due to lower net lease revenues generated from a smaller fleet size  offset partially by lower allocations of selling  general and administrative expenses

until the refinancing has been completed  there is substantial doubt that the company will be able to continue as a going concern 
year the company s computer systems are currently undergoing modifications in order to render the systems ready for the year the company has completed a detailed inventory of all software and hardware systems and has identified all components which need to be modified 
the company has completed all the necessary changes and is now performing the required tests in a dedicated year environment 
the company anticipates that all testing will be completed by mid the company has contacted all of its critical business suppliers and has been advised that their systems are year compliant 
expenses associated with addressing the year issues are being recognized as incurred 
management has not yet assessed the year compliance expense but does not anticipate the costs incurred to date or to be incurred in the future to be in excess of million 
the company believes it will be able to resolve any major year issues 
the company is aware of the implications of a year computer system failure and is currently in the process of developing its contingency plans 
whilst management believe the possibility of a year system failure to be remote  if the company s internal systems  or those of its critical business suppliers fail  the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations may be adversely affected 
the company has assessed the introduction of a single european currency  the euro  and believes that it will not be materially affected 
in the past  the effects of inflation on administrative and operating expenses have been largely offset by the company s ability to increase the operational economies of scale through expansion of the fleet 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this item should be read in conjunction with and by reference to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk outstanding borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
at december  of total borrowings had floating interest rates 
the company performed an analysis of borrowings with variable interest rates to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this analysis  the same change was applied to the current balance outstanding leaving all other factors constant 
it was found that if a increase was applied to market rates  the expected effect would be to reduce annual cash flows by million 
exchange rate risk substantially all of the company s revenues are billed and paid in us dollars and approximately of costs in were incurred and paid in us dollars 
of the remaining costs  approximately are individually small  unpredictable and incurred in various denominations and thus are not suitable for cost effective hedging 
from time to time  cronos hedges a portion of the expenses that are predictable and are principally in uk pounds sterling 
in addition  almost all of the company s container purchases are paid for in us dollars 
the cronos group as exchange rates are outside of the control of the company  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not adversely effect its results of operations and financial condition 
by reference to  it is estimated that for every fall in value of the us dollar  the effect would be to reduce cash flows by million in any similar year
