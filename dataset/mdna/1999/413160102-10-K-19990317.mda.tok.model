item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harmonic designs  manufactures and markets digital fiber optic systems for delivering video  voice and data services over cable  satellite and wireless networks 
almost all of our sales have been derived directly or indirectly from sales of fiber optic transmission systems to cable television operators 
with the introduction of our transend digital headend products in and the subsequent purchase of new media communication ltd  we have broadened our product offering to enable delivery of digital video  voice and data over satellite and wireless networks in addition to cable systems 
to date  a substantial majority of harmonic s net sales have been to relatively few customers  and harmonic expects this customer concentration to continue in the foreseeable future 
in  sales to tci accounted for of harmonic s net sales and sales to a chinese distributor accounted for of harmonic s net sales 
in  sales to capella  harmonic s canadian distributor  accounted for of harmonic s net sales 
in  sales to tratec  harmonic s former uk distributor  capella and antec accounted for  and  respectively  of harmonic s net sales 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and of net sales  respectively 
international sales are made primarily to distributors  which are generally responsible for importing the products and providing installation and technical support and service to customers within their territory 
we expect international sales to continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
harmonic s net sales in the second half of and the first quarter of were negatively affected by a slow down in spending by cable television operators in the us and in foreign markets 
the factors contributing to this slow down in capital spending included consolidation and system exchanges by our domestic cable customers  which generally have had the initial effect of delaying certain system upgrades  uncertainty related to development of digital video and cable modem industry standards  delays associated with the evaluation of new services and system architectures by many cable television operators  emphasis on marketing and customer service strategies by some international cable television operators instead of construction of networks  and general economic conditions in international markets 
while harmonic s net sales increased in the last three quarters of from the level achieved in the first quarter of due to increased spending in the us cable television industry  spending by international cable television operators generally remained weak 
harmonic cannot predict when international cable television spending will increase and whether us cable television spending will continue to grow 
in addition  cable television capital spending can be subject to the effects of seasonality  with fewer construction and upgrade projects typically occurring in winter months and otherwise being affected by inclement weather 
in  and  sales of optical transmitters accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of net sales and sales of optical node receivers  return path and network management products accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of net sales 
in  transend and cyberstream digital products accounted for of net sales 
there were no significant sales of digital products in or harmonic generally recognizes revenue upon shipment of product 
harmonic does not provide for rights of return to end users or distributors 
a provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
to date  gross margins on sales of optical transmitter products have been higher than sales of receiver and return path products 
in addition  sales made to customers outside of the united states have generally carried higher gross margins 
in  we expect our gross margins to be below levels principally due to anticipated softness in certain international markets  continued pricing pressure  our expected mix of products sold and manufacturing start up costs associated with recent product introductions 
harmonic often recognizes a substantial portion of its revenues in the last month of the quarter 
harmonic establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of harmonic s business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
harmonic s expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected levels of future sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on operating results may be magnified by harmonic s inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of these and other factors  harmonic s operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
see risk factors our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
results of operations harmonic s historical consolidated statements of operations data for each of the three years ended december   and as a percentage of net sales  are as follows fiscal year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative acquired in process technology total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net sales harmonic s net sales increased by to million in as compared to million in this growth in net sales was primarily attributable to the sale of new products  including transend digital headend products  metrolink dwdm systems and pwrblazer scaleable nodes  which began volume shipment during the middle of  as well as to an increase in spending by our domestic customers in the second half of during domestic sales increased by  principally due to increased shipments to tci  while international sales decreased by due to continued weakness in many international markets 
the increase in net sales was also due to higher unit sales of existing products partially offset by lower selling prices for certain products 
net sales increased by to million in from million in this growth in net sales in was primarily attributable to higher unit sales of harmonic s receiver and return path products and sales of the nm maxlink transmission system  which began shipment during the second quarter of these factors were partially offset by lower unit sales of yaglink transmitters due in part to the increasing acceptance of nm transmitters among cable operators for broadcast transmission 
gross profit gross profit decreased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the decreases in gross profit and gross margins were principally due to a lower percentage of international sales resulting from reduced demand  a less favorable product mix which included a lower percentage of transmitters  and pricing pressure for certain products due to increased competition 
in addition  gross profit and gross margins were negatively impacted by start up costs associated with new product introductions and an increase in inventory reserves for existing products following the introduction of new products 
harmonic expects gross margins to continue to be below levels in due to anticipated softness in certain international markets  expected changes in product mix  pricing pressure for certain products and manufacturing start up costs associated with recent product introductions 
gross profit increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in gross profit was principally due to higher unit sales volume and lower manufacturing costs  particularly for harmonic s maxlink products  which commenced shipment during the second quarter of  and improved margins on return path products resulting from product design changes 
these factors were partially offset by a less favorable product mix which included lower sales of transmitters as a percentage of net sales  and lower selling prices for certain products 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in research and development expenses in was primarily due to increased headcount  particularly at harmonic s subsidiary in caesarea  israel which is continuing to develop harmonic s transend digital headend products  and to the inclusion of nmc s research and development expenses starting in january research and development expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in research and development expenses in both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was principally attributable to increased headcount and higher prototype material costs in connection with the node and digital development programs 
research and development expenses for  and are net of grants of approximately   and  respectively 
harmonic anticipates that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  although they may vary as a percentage of net sales 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in sales and marketing expenses in both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher headcount and costs associated with expansion and reorganization of the direct sales force  technical support and marketing organizations  particularly to support the introduction of our new products 
this increase was due to expenses incurred in connection with the recruiting and staffing for new international sales and technical support centers 
in addition  higher promotional expenses and the inclusion of nmc s sales and marketing expenses starting in january contributed to the increase 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in sales and marketing expenses in was primarily due to higher headcount associated with expansion of the direct sales force  customer service and technical support organizations  expenses associated with establishing international sales offices  and higher promotional expenses 
harmonic expects that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  although they may vary as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to the inclusion of nmc s expenses starting in january  as well as costs of supporting harmonic s growth in overall headcount  and the establishment of international sales and support offices 
general and administrative expenses increased to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase in absolute expenses in was principally attributable to costs of supporting harmonic s growth in overall headcount and operations and providing for a higher accounts receivable reserve 
harmonic expects to incur higher levels of general and administrative expenses in the future  although such expenses may vary as a percentage of net sales 
acquired in process technology on january   harmonic acquired nmc  a privately held israeli development stage company with employees  for million in a stock for stock transaction 
harmonic also assumed all outstanding stock options of nmc 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the fair value of the assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their fair value at the time of the transaction 
harmonic determined  with the aid of an independent appraisal  that technological feasibility of the acquired in process technology had not yet been established 
harmonic also believed that nmc s existing technology would generate no further revenue on account of its obsolescence 
accordingly  no value was assigned to the existing technology 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  harmonic wrote off acquired in process research and development expenses of million as a one time charge to operations in the first quarter of historically  nmc had developed receiver cards for data transmission over cable  wireless and satellite networks 
these analog products operated at transmission speeds of mbps and had been sold only to a limited number of customers 
nmc concluded during that these analog products were rapidly becoming obsolete and discontinued research and development efforts 
based on customer feedback and expected market trends  nmc commenced technology development of the cyberstream system  a digital system designed to provide substantially increased transmission speeds of mbps to mbps and to incorporate differentiated service capabilities and sophisticated network management 
at the time of the nmc acquisition  nmc had commenced development of the cyberstream system  which was comprised of a data gateway at the satellite uplink or cable headend  network management and control features at the headend  and a receiver card for installation in a personal computer or a local area network router device 
just prior to the acquisition  nmc had initiated production of a limited number of prototype receiver cards in order to participate in pilot trials with two prospective customers 
shipment of the prototype cards commenced at the end of harmonic determined that since these products were intended for deployment in networks with large numbers of subscribers  nmc would have to engage in ongoing trials over an extended period to determine the products technological feasibility 
as part of these trials  nmc also shipped initial versions of operating software  but was several months away from completion of critical elements of the cyberstream system  such as quality of service  simple network management protocol and porting of the software to the windows and nt platforms 
subsequent to the acquisition  harmonic expended million in in research and development costs to accelerate development and to incorporate changes resulting from field trial evaluations 
to estimate the value of nmc s existing and in process technology  the total income forecasted was allocated to existing  in process and future technology based on the products scheduled release dates and expected lives 
the forecasts assumed timely release of the products as anticipated by harmonic and that nmc would utilize harmonic distribution channels 
estimated revenues for the purchased in process products were assumed to commence by the middle of fiscal year and increase through fiscal year  at which time they were assumed to decrease through fiscal year  as newer products would be released 
rapid change and improvements in technology characterize the high speed data delivery market 
harmonic s future success will depend on its ability to achieve scientific and technological advances and to translate such advances into commercially competitive products on a timely basis that keep pace with competing technological developments and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  consisting principally of interest income  was million in  million in and million in the decreases in and were due primarily to lower interest income on lower average cash and cash equivalents balances 
income taxes no provision for income taxes was recorded for due to the net loss incurred 
the provision for income taxes for and was based on an estimated annual tax rate of resulting from federal and state alternative minimum taxes and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
harmonic had available federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  under current tax law  harmonic s utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be limited in certain circumstances resulting from a change in ownership 
in  harmonic expects to have an effective annual tax rate substantially lower than statutory rates  approximating to  due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
beyond  harmonic expects to have an effective annual tax rate that approximates statutory rates 
liquidity and capital resources harmonic completed its initial public offering in may  raising approximately million  net of offering costs 
prior to that  harmonic satisfied its liquidity needs primarily from the net proceeds of private sales of preferred stock  and to a lesser extent  from capital equipment leases and bank borrowings 
cash used in operations was million in compared to cash provided by operations of million in and million in the increase in cash used in operations in compared to was primarily due to the net loss and higher inventory levels  partially offset by improved customer collections and higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase in cash provided by operations in compared to was principally attributable to slower growth in receivables  inventory and prepaid expenses and other assets  partially offset by lower net income  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net working capital was million at december   including million of cash and cash equivalents 
during  harmonic had a bank line of credit and equipment term loan facilities which provided up to million and million in borrowings  respectively 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the bank line at december   although harmonic had guaranteed certain borrowing facilities of its subsidiaries totaling million with letters of credit and had total letters of credit issued under the line of million  which expire at various dates throughout fiscal year as of december   borrowings of  were outstanding under the term loan 
these facilities were available until december during the fourth quarter of  harmonic agreed to the principal terms of an amended and restated bank line of credit facility  which was finalized in march the new facility provides for borrowings of up to million with a million equipment term loan sub limit 
this new line  which expires in march  bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus prime rate plus under the term loan sub limit 
the line is secured by substantially all of the assets of harmonic 
additions to property  plant and equipment were approximately million during compared to million in and million in respectively 
while harmonic currently has no material commitments  it expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures in  primarily for manufacturing and test equipment 
harmonic believes that its existing liquidity sources  including its new bank line of credit facility  and anticipated funds from operations will satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries in israel and in the united kingdom 
harmonic has not engaged in hedging activities as of december  and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
harmonic has subsidiaries in israel and the united kingdom whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on future operating results  fair values or cash flows  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of the israeli shekel or british pound would not harm harmonic s financial condition and results of operations 
year readiness disclosure many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the date code field 
these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish twenty first century dates from twentieth century dates 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced in order to comply with such year or yk requirements 
harmonic has established a corporate wide program to address the yk issue 
this program encompasses product  internal systems and supplier and business partner compliance 
the project is comprised of identification of risks  assessment of risks  development of remediation or contingency plans and implementation and testing 
based upon the assessments to date  all hardware products currently under development or released  and all software products currently under development are yk compliant 
certain software products currently installed at customer sites are not yk compliant and harmonic is working with its customers to provide migration paths for each product 
harmonic s significant internal systems have been purchased from outside vendors and are yk compliant 
harmonic is in the process of upgrading internal systems that are not currently yk compliant  and expects to have this process completed by mid to date  yk costs have not been material to harmonic and harmonic does not expect that its yk costs will exceed  in the future 
harmonic currently does not have a contingency plan to address yk issues related to its products and internal systems  but will develop a contingency plan by mid if its products and internal systems are not yet yk compliant 
in addition  harmonic is working with its suppliers and business partners to identify at what stage they are in the process of identifying and addressing the yk issue and to assess the resulting risks and develop appropriate contingency plans 
harmonic will continue to perform compliance reviews and tests to ensure compliance on an ongoing basis 
harmonic currently does not anticipate that the cost of its yk program will be material to its financial condition and results of operations 
although harmonic has established and commenced its program to address yk issues  the failure of harmonic products to operate properly with regard to the yk requirements could a cause harmonic to incur unanticipated expenses to remedy any problems  b cause a reduction in sales and c expose harmonic to related litigation by its customers  each of which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  harmonic and third parties with whom it conducts business may utilize equipment or software that may not be yk compliant 
failure of harmonic s or any such third party s equipment or software to operate properly with regard to the yk requirements could cause  among other things  harmonic or any such third party to incur unanticipated expenses or efforts to remedy any problems  which could have a material adverse effect on its or their respective business  operating results and financial condition 
furthermore  the purchasing patterns of customers or potential customers may be affected by yk issues as companies expend significant resources to evaluate and to correct their equipment or software for yk compliance and as they simultaneously evaluate the preparedness of the third parties with whom they deal 
these expenditures may result in reduced funds available to purchase products and services such as those offered by harmonic  which could have a material adverse effect on harmonic business  operating results and financial condition 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future  on an annual and a quarterly basis  as a result of several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include the level of capital spending of our customers  both in the us and in foreign markets  changes in market demand  the timing and amount of customer orders  competitive market conditions  our unpredictable sales cycles  new product introductions by our competitors or by us  changes in domestic and international regulatory environments  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  subassemblies and modules  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of our products sold  our development of custom products  the level of international sales  and economic conditions specific to the cable television industry and general economic conditions 
in addition  we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of the quarter 
we establish our expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on projected sales levels  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  variations in timing of sales can cause significant fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our business is derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  the timing of such orders can also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
our expenses for any given quarter are typically based on expected sales and if sales are below expectations in any given quarter  the adverse impact of the shortfall on our operating results may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for the shortfall 
as a result of all these factors  our operating results in one or more future periods may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline 
we depend on cable industry capital spending for substantially all of our revenue 
almost all of our sales have been derived  directly or indirectly  from sales to cable television operators and we expect these sales to constitute a substantial majority for the foreseeable future 
demand for our products depends to a significant extent upon the magnitude and timing of capital spending by cable television operators for constructing  rebuilding or upgrading their systems 
the capital spending patterns of cable television operators are dependent on a variety of factors  including access to financing  cable television operators annual budget cycles  the status of federal  local and foreign government regulation of telecommunications and television broadcasting  overall demand for cable television services and the acceptance of new broadband services  competitive pressures including the availability of alternative video delivery technologies such as satellite broadcasting  and discretionary customer spending patterns and general economic conditions 
our net sales in the second half of and the first quarter of were negatively affected by a slow down in spending by cable television operators in the us and in foreign markets 
the factors contributing to this slow down in capital spending included consolidation and system exchanges by our domestic cable customers  which generally have had the initial effect of delaying certain system upgrades  uncertainty related to development of digital video and cable modem industry standards  delays associated with the evaluation of new services and system architectures by many cable television operators  emphasis on marketing and customer service strategies by some international cable television operators instead of construction of networks  and general economic conditions in international markets 
while our net sales increased in the last three quarters of from the level achieved in the first quarter of due to increased spending in the us cable television industry  spending by international cable television operators generally remained weak 
we cannot predict when international cable television spending will increase and whether us cable television spending will continue to grow 
in addition  cable television capital spending can be subject to the effects of seasonality  with fewer construction and upgrade projects typically occurring in winter months and otherwise being affected by inclement weather 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would harm our business 
historically  a significant majority of our sales have been to relatively few customers 
sales to our ten largest customers in  and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of net sales 
due in part to the consolidation of ownership of domestic cable television systems  we expect that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
for example  in  sales to telecommunications  inc  or tci  which was recently acquired by at t  represented approximately of our net sales and sales to a chinese distributor represented approximately 
almost all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  and none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would harm our business 
we depend on our international sales and are subject to the risks associated with international operations 
sales to customers outside of the united states in  and represented  and of net sales  respectively  and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  import and export license requirements  tariffs  taxes and other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  and political and economic instability 
while our international sales are typically denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country 
we do not currently engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
furthermore  payment cycles for international customers are typically longer than those for customers in the united states 
unpredictable sales cycles could cause us to fail to meet or exceed the expectations of security analysts and investors for any given period 
further  we cannot assure you that foreign markets will continue to develop 
in recent periods  certain asian and latin american currencies have devalued significantly in relation to the us dollar 
we believe that financial developments in asia and latin america were a major factor contributing to lower international net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  the uncertain financial situation in asia has placed financial pressure on some of our distributors 
in response  we increased accounts receivable reserves in the first quarter of we are continuing to evaluate the effect on our business of recent financial developments in asia and latin america 
given the current political and economic uncertainties in china and throughout asia  we cannot assure you that shipment of orders to asia  including china  will be made as scheduled  or at all 
we cannot assure you that our sales and collection cycles in asia and latin america will not continue to be harmed by the uncertain financial climate 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we must be able to manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting the demand of our customers 
from time to time  we receive indications from our customers as to their future plans and requirements to ensure that we will be prepared to meet their demand for our products 
in the past  however  we have received such indications but  on occasion  we did not ultimately receive purchase orders for our products 
we must be able to effectively manage expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting potential demand for our products 
in addition  if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  we may lose business from such customers 
if we expend resources and purchase materials to manufacture products and such products are not purchased  our business and operating results could suffer 
the market in which we operate is intensely competitive and many of our competitors are larger and more established 
the market for cable television transmission equipment is extremely competitive and has been characterized by rapid technological change 
harmonic s current competitors include significantly larger corporations such as adc telecommunications  antec a company owned in part by tci  general instrument  philips and scientific atlanta 
additional competition could come from new entrants in the broadband communications equipment market  such as lucent technologies 
most of these companies are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these large organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by cable television operators 
in addition  many of our competitors have more long stand ing and established relationships with domestic and foreign cable television operators than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competition will not harm our business 
if any of our competitors products or technologies were to become the industry standard or if any of our smaller competitors were to enter into or expand relationships with larger companies through mergers  acquisitions or otherwise  our business could be seriously harmed 
further  our competitors may bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
see business competition 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature and characterized by rapid technological change 
broadband communications markets are relatively immature  making it difficult to accurately predict the markets future growth rate  size and technological direction 
in view of the evolving nature of these markets  it is possible that cable television operators  telephone companies or other suppliers of broadband wireless and satellite services will decide to adopt alternative architectures or technologies that are incompatible with our current or future products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that incorporate or are compatible with these new architectures or technologies  our business would suffer 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
broadband communications markets are characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
however  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce these products 
moreover  these products may not achieve broad commercial acceptance and may have lower gross margins than our other products 
in addition  to successfully develop and market our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into any necessary technology development or licensing agreement on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements when necessary could limit our ability to develop and market new products and  accordingly  could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we need to effectively manage our growth 
the growth in harmonic s business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on harmonic s personnel  management and other resources 
harmonic s ability to manage any future growth effectively will require us to attract  train  motivate and manage new employees successfully  to integrate new employees into our overall operations  to retain key employees and to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems 
if we fail to manage our future growth effectively  our business could suffer 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel 
our future success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate high caliber personnel  in addition to attracting new personnel 
competition for qualified technical and other personnel is intense  particularly in the san francisco bay area and israel  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
competitors and others have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees 
while our employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  we generally do not have employment contracts or noncompetition agreements with any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and other technical personnel  could negatively affect our business 
our acquisition of nmc has created numerous risks and challenges for us 
the acquisition of nmc has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our personnel  management and other resources 
the acquisition of nmc in january has allowed us to develop and expand our product offerings to include broadband high speed data delivery hardware and software and increased the scope of our international operations in israel 
the acquisition of nmc continues to impose challenges  including the dependence on the evolution and growth of the market for wireless and satellite broadband services  difficulties in the assimilation of operations  research and development efforts  products  personnel and cultures of harmonic and nmc  our ability to successfully develop  manufacture and gain market acceptance of the products of nmc  and the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of nmc 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these challenges  and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may be subject to risks associated with acquisitions 
we have made and may make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make acquisitions  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies personnel and operations or integrating the acquired technology or products into ours 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if we are unable to successfully address any of these risks  our business  financial condition and operating results could be harmed 
if sales forecasted for a particular period are not realized in that period due to the unpredictable sales cycles of our products  our operating results for that period will be harmed 
the sales cycles of many of our products  particularly our newer products and products sold internationally  are typically unpredictable and usually involve a significant technical evaluation  a commitment of capital and other resources by cable and other network operators  delays associated with cable and other network operators internal procedures to approve large capital expenditures  time required to engineer the deployment of new technologies or services within broadband networks  and testing and acceptance of new technologies that affect key operations 
for these and other reasons  our sales cycles generally last three to six months  but can last up to months 
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter do not occur in that quarter  our operating results for that quarter could be substantially lower than anticipated 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
we currently hold issued united states patents and issued foreign patents  and have a number of patent applications pending 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures  we cannot assure you that any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property right owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged  that such intellectual property right will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
we cannot assure you that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate the technological expertise and innovation of our personnel into new and enhanced products 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers as needed  and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  we have taken in the past  and may take in the future  legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business and operating results 
in order to successfully develop and market our planned products for digital applications  we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
although many companies are often willing to enter into such technology development or licensing agreements  we cannot assure you that such agreements will be negotiated on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements  when necessary  could limit our ability to develop and market new products and could cause our business to suffer 
as is common in our industry  we have from time to time received notification from other companies of intellectual property rights held by those companies upon which our products may infringe 
any claim or litigation  with or without merit  could be costly  time consuming and could result in a diversion of management s attention  which could harm our business 
if we were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities for such infringement  which could be material  and could be required to seek licenses from other companies or to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling certain products or using certain processes 
although holders of patents and other intellectual property rights often offer licenses to their patent or other intellectual property rights  we cannot assure you that licenses would be offered  that the terms of any offered license would be acceptable to us or that failure to obtain a license would not cause our operating results to suffer 
we may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to secure adequate funds in terms acceptable to us 
we currently anticipate that our existing cash balances and available line of credit and cash flow expected to be generated from future operations  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates change or prove inaccurate or in order for us to respond to unforeseen technological or marketing hurdles or to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
in addition  we expect to review potential acquisitions that would complement our existing product offerings or enhance our technical capabilities 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway with respect to any potential acquisition  any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital 
funds may not be available at the time or times needed  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
we purchase several key components  subassemblies and modules used in the manufacture or integration of our products from sole or limited sources  and we are increasingly dependent on contract manufacturers 
many components  subassemblies and modules necessary for the manufacture or integration of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on sole or limited suppliers  particularly foreign suppliers  and our increasing reliance on subcontractors involves several risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  subassemblies or modules and reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery of components  subassemblies or modules 
certain key elements of our digital headend products are provided by a sole foreign supplier 
we do not generally maintain long term agreements with any of our suppliers or subcontractors 
an inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply could affect our ability to ship our products on a timely basis  which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and harm our business 
we attempt to limit this risk by maintaining safety stocks of these components  subassemblies and modules 
as a result of this investment in inventories  we may be subject to an increasing risk of inventory obsolescence in the future  which could harm our business

we face risks associated with having important facilities and resources located in israel 
harmonic maintains two facilities in the state of israel with a total of approximately employees 
the personnel at these facilities represent a significant portion of our research and development operations 
accordingly  we are directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel  and any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could significantly harm our business 
in addition  most of our employees in israel are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on harmonic in the future 
our business could be adversely impacted by year compliance issues 
during the next year  many software programs may not recognize calendar dates beginning in the year this problem could force computers or machines which utilize date dependent software to either shut down or provide incorrect information 
to address this problem  we have examined our computer and information systems  contacted our software and hardware providers  and  where necessary  made upgrades to our systems 
based upon the assessments to date  all hardware products currently under development or released  and all software products currently under development are yk compliant 
certain software products currently installed at customer sites are not yk compliant and harmonic is working with its customers to provide migration paths for each product 
undetected errors or defects may remain 
disruptions to our business or unexpected costs may arise because of undetected errors or defects in the technology used in our products  manufacturing processes or internal information systems  which are comprised predominantly of third party software and hardware 
if we  or any of our key suppliers or customers  fail to mitigate internal and external year risks  we may temporarily be unable to process transactions  manufacture products  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities or we may experience a decline in sales  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year readiness disclosure 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the offering price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
see price range of common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
see description of capital stock 
a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of harmonic due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
harmonic is exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and currencies of harmonic s subsidiaries in israel and in the united kingdom 
harmonic has not engaged in hedging activities as of december  and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
harmonic has subsidiaries in israel and the united kingdom whose sales are generally denominated in us dollars 
while harmonic does not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on future operating results  fair values or cash flows  harmonic cannot assure you that a sudden and significant change in the value of the israeli shekel or british pound would not harm harmonic s financial condition and results of operations
