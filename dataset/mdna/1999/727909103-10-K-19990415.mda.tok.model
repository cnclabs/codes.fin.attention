item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the information in this section should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere herein 
overview our primary business is the production  distribution  marketing and sale of music 
our pre recorded music products include new releases  typically by established artists  as well as compilations featuring various artists and repackagings of previously recorded music from our master music catalog and under licenses from third party record companies 
we sell music products  including compact discs  tape cassettes and digital versatile discs dvds mainly to retailers and wholesalers primarily in the united states 
we currently release music in a variety of genres including classical  urban  adult contemporary  blues  gospel and country and on our intersound classical  platinum  river north  house of blues  cgi platinum and platinum nashville labels 
our headquarters are located in downers grove  illinois  our primary distribution facility is located in roswell  georgia  and we have a promotional office in nashville  tennessee 
we distribute our products through a multi channel system comprised of i platinum distribution  our proprietary distribution system  ii universal music and video distribution universal  our third party  major label distributor  iii internationally  primarily through licensing agreements as well as production and distribution agreements on a territory by territory basis and iv internet distribution 
we are increasing the volume of products distributed through platinum distribution compared to universal  this results in reduced incremental costs per record sold  due to the lack of a third party distribution fee 
our gross revenues through universal were  and  for the fourth quarter of and  respectively  reflecting a decrease from the prior period  and  and  for fiscal and  respectively  reflecting a decrease from the prior period 
during the fourth quarter of  a plan was approved to move our distribution facilities in roswell  georgia to a new  larger facility 
the move is planned to take place during spring of this new facility is intended to enable us to perform more efficiently and provide the necessary space for anticipated growth 
in preparation for the move  we reduced the carrying cost of a significant amount of our older catalog titles resulting in a substantial write down of approximately  this write down was recognized in anticipation of the disposal of these titles rather than incurring the cost of moving these titles to the new distribution facility 
accordingly  provisions have been made in our financial statements at december   related to these titles 
we are also increasing our international sales efforts by establishing additional licensing agreements as well as production and distribution agreements on a territory by territory basis 
in  our international revenues grew to  from  in the prior year 
we believe international revenues will continue to be a strong growth area for our products 
while we have historically distributed records for a limited number of outside labels  it is our strategy to increase the volume of outside labels we distribute in order to generate additional revenues and to expand our platinum distribution system 
under these arrangements  we generate a distribution fee of approximately to  depending on the volume and range of services provided 
the gross margin from these sales ranges from a low of for third party product distributed by universal to which we owe a distribution fee to for product distributed through our proprietary systems 
these activities represented of our gross revenues in the year ended december   as compared to in the year ended may  we believe that increasing the volume of products distributed for select third parties will contribute significantly to offsetting the fixed costs of maintaining platinum distribution as well as provide incremental revenue and income 
we intend to pursue additional third party distribution opportunities in the future 
in  we added distribution via the internet as a distribution channel 
in october  we announced the debut of our website  www 
platinumcd 
com  and our equity investment and revenue sharing arrangement with musicmaker 
com  inc musicmaker 
com  the first and largest digital download and burn and mail company 
through musicmaker 
com our customers can create custom compilation cds or download songs onto the hard drive of their own computers using liquid audio and secure mp  two downloading formats used to protect the copyrights of the record label and the recording artist 
we also joined with amazon 
com  a leader in the internet commerce industry  to provide customers who visit our website access to hundreds of thousands of commercially available titles 
during the fiscal year ended may   we completed several acquisitions i substantially all of the assets of rex music  inc  ii substantially all of the assets of double j music group  iii a interest in the house of blues music company and iv substantially all of the assets of intersound  inc as a result of these acquisitions  we incurred significant costs to merge and restructure our business with the acquired companies 
such merger and restructuring costs included severance costs  relocation costs  lease commitment write offs  warehouse closing costs and other related costs 
such costs were  and  during the seven months ended december   and the year ended may   respectively  relating primarily to severance costs and a distribution termination fee 
the restructuring was substantially completed at december  such restructuring resulted in shifts in the selling and promotion efforts of our country label and in house sales department and a shift in third party fulfillment of platinum christian distribution 
in addition  one time costs for the year ended may   include write offs of artist advances of approximately  in areas for which we have chosen to redirect our resources 
these costs were classified as merger  restructuring and one time costs and were included in our operating losses 
we determined the purchase price allocation for the assets purchased and liabilities assumed from intersound  inc  as disclosed in the balance sheet at may   based on available information at that time 
however  during the seven months ended december   we ascertained that the purchase value allocated to certain purchased assets exceeded their fair market values by approximately  in addition  we identified  of product returns which we believe relate to product that had been sold prior to our purchase of intersound  inc had these matters been identified by us at the time of purchase or shortly thereafter  such valuations would have been recorded through purchase accounting  resulting in no subsequent impact to the income statement 
as these matters were not identified at the time of purchase or shortly thereafter  we were required to reflect these amounts in our results of operations for the seven months ended december   resulting in a nonrecurring charge to operations of  the returned product of  is reflected in net revenues with corresponding offsets of  to cost of sales  the asset write down of  was also included in cost of sales 
these matters were subject of an action entitled jcsho  inc

platinum entertainment  inc  d 
minn 
which was settled on march  see item legal proceedings 
product sales are recognized upon shipment 
in accordance with industry practice  our music products are sold on a returnable basis 
our allowance for future returns is based upon our historical returns  soundscan data  and the return rate of universal 
our returns as a percentage of gross revenues were     and for the years ended december  and  the seven months ended december  and  and the years ended may  and  respectively 
our historical returns experience has been adversely impacted by several factors 
as discussed above  we experienced excessive returns of intersound  inc product during the seven months ended december   that we believe related to intersound  inc prior to our acquisition 
in addition  as a result of the acquisitions completed during the fiscal year ended may   including intersound  inc  we terminated our relationship with riverside book and bible house  inc riverside for fulfillment of platinum christian distribution 
platinum christian distribution fulfillment is now handled by our internal distribution system 
as a result  we experienced unusually high returns of our product through the riverside distribution channel as customers were allowed a limited time to return products before returns were no longer accepted from previous riverside sales 
in addition  we ceased relations with certain customers who consistently failed to pay on a timely basis  prompting an unusually high returns experience from these customers 
it is our policy to inventory all returned product and resell such product at market value 
the excessive product returns during the fiscal year ended may   are primarily close out items 
these items have been inventoried and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
some of these items were included in the write down in anticipation of the facility move  as discussed above 
during june  we executed a settlement agreement with k tel international  inc  whereby we mutually agreed to settle our claims to  we deposited in escrow pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement signed by us and k tel international  inc during march  and terminated by us during september pursuant to this settlement agreement  each party received of the escrowed amount 
we fully reserved the  in escrow prior to december and expensed approximately  of legal  accounting and other incremental costs related to this transaction 
accordingly  our selling  general and administrative expenses for are net of  received from this settlement 
we require significant recurring funds for artist and repertoire a r expenses  which include recorded music costs 
we make substantial payments each year for recording costs and advances to artists and producers in order to maintain and enhance our artist roster 
advances to established artists and producers and direct costs associated with the creation of record masters are capitalized and are charged to cost of sales as the related albums earn revenues or when the amounts are determined to be unrecoverable 
we have historically sustained losses  in part due to the high costs associated with the establishment and expansion of our activities 
we believe that the significant investments made to date will enhance our future profitability 
prior to march  a significant portion of our losses resulted from the operation of our river north recording studio 
during the fiscal year ended may   we decided to discontinue this business and disposed of our river north studio operations in conjunction with the initial public offering of our common stock during march results of operations during february  our board of directors resolved to change our fiscal year  formerly may  to a calendar year  effective december  this change in fiscal year conforms our fiscal periods to the quarterly and semi annual periods for which we report royalties to our recording artists and publishers as well as the annual term of our distribution agreement with universal 
effective with the third quarter of  we changed our method for reporting product returns in the statements of operations and balance sheet 
while there is no impact on gross margins for operations previously reported  a reclassification between returns and cost of sales in the statements of operations has been made to prior period amounts to reflect returns activity consistently with our current reporting practices 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of gross revenues represented by certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations

we significantly reduced our direct to consumer sales of which approximately  in gross revenues were recognized during the prior fiscal year 
we also experienced decreases in gross revenues through universal 
gross revenues through universal were down  or in the fourth quarter of and  or in compared to the prior year 
universal purchased our former third party  major label distributor  polygram group distribution  during the summer of these decreases were in part offset by increases in gross sales from the distribution of third party product over the prior year  representing of current year gross revenues compared to only in the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to distribution of third party labels we signed during our notable releases shipped during included the urban compilation booty mix  pop artist taylor dayne s naked without you  gospel stellar award winner vickie winans live in detroit  country singer t 
graham brown s wine into water  and numerous releases from our classical catalog  which ranked on billboard s budget classical chart

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception  including a net loss of   after preferred dividend requirements and negative cash flows from operations of  in fiscal we have historically sustained net losses and negative cash flows  in part due to the high costs associated with the establishment and expansion of our activities 
historically  we have funded our operations and other activities from a variety of capital sources including  debt and equity financing 
as a result of the significant net loss discussed above  we were in violation of two of the financial debt covenants contained in our bank credit agreement during the third and fourth quarters of and as of september  and december  as discussed below  these covenant violations were waived and amended november  and april   respectively 
we have continued to obtain equity financing from time to time

on november  and april   the bank waived our financial covenant violations 
the april amendment also adjusted our net worth  earnings and interest coverage ratio financial covenants to terms more favorable to us 
achieving these new financial covenants is dependent on us fulfilling our business plan and budget 
on april   we issued shares of a new series of preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock to one of our executive officers and a director and certain other members of our board of directors  providing proceeds of approximately  see note in the notes to the financial statements 
in addition to the equity placements described above  we may need additional equity financing in order to achieve our fiscal plan 
while we have been successful in the past in raising equity as needed  there can be no assurance that additional equity financing may be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
also  while we believe that our fiscal plans  if achieved  will enable us to comply with the financial covenants in the amended debt agreement  if some or all our plans do not materialize  we may be in violation of the financial covenants 
in this case  we may require additional funds to operate and such funds may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
failure to raise needed fundings on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business

royalties are not paid to the artist until all advances made to the artist have been recouped by us 
also  we establish and maintain reserves relative to royalty payments for a period of to months to allow for product returns activity as royalties are not owed on returned product

because the facility is subject to an acceleration clause  the entire balance is classified as current in the balance sheet 
as of december   we had  available under our line of credit 
during the third and fourth quarters of  and as of september  and december   we were out of compliance with certain financial covenants

inflation the impact of inflation on our operating results has been moderate in recent years  reflecting generally lower rates of inflation in the economy 
while inflation has not had a material impact on operating results  there is no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
year risks many existing computer programs use only two digits rather than four to identify a year in the date field 
these programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century 
if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year we are currently working to resolve  but have not completed  an assessment of our year issues 
until we have completed our review of the significant software and equipment used in our business operations  and the operations of our key business partners  we cannot be sure that our efforts to address year issues are appropriate  adequate or complete 
based on our current assessment of our year issues  we may face the following concerns we are dependent on personal computer systems for internal electronic information processing 
to bring our systems into year compliance we have spent approximately  since january   to replace existing hardware 
we are currently operating two independent financial accounting software packages one in our downers grove  illinois location and the other in our roswell  georgia location  our roswell location also houses our distribution system 
we upgraded the software financial software package used in both locations with software that is year compliant 
we intend to modify our existing distribution software used in both locations to be year compliant at no material incremental cost 
we have spent approximately  on software since january  we have also paid  in consulting services since january  we plan to be year compliant by july  we are currently assessing the state of readiness for year of our material vendors  suppliers  customers and other material third parties 
this assessment is not complete 
we expect to have this assessment completed by july  if any of our material vendors  suppliers or customers  particularly universal  has a serious year problem  we could experience a loss of revenues from their operations and or incur a significant amount of expenses 
as a result of these year issues  we may suffer the following consequences we may experience a significant number of operational inconveniences and inefficiencies for us and our customers that may divert our time and attention and financial and human resources from our ordinary business activities 
we may suffer serious systems failures that may require significant efforts by us or our customers to prevent or alleviate material business disruptions 
we may be in default of a number of agreements  including our credit agreement  if we fail to respond to our year issues in a timely manner 
we may experience significant loss of revenues or incur a significant amount of unanticipated expenses 
we may incur liability for the losses incurred by our customers or others where business is disrupted by our system failures or incur significant costs of defending claims made against us for the recovery of such losses
