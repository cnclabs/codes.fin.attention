the widening of spreads between treasury securities and mbs resulted in securitized lenders  such as the company  having to meet significant margin calls from the lenders who had financed the accumulation of mortgage loans intended for securitization and margin calls caused by the decline in the value of related hedge positions 
at this time the company held approximately billion of commercial mortgage and home equity loans on its balance sheet 
the company made the decision to re focus its commercial mortgage banking business to emphasize its operations which have historically provided strong and predictable earnings growth i core real estate investment banking and mortgage banking through holliday fenoglio fowler  ii commercial mortgage loan originations and sales under agency multifamily lending programs with quasi governmental agencies  such as fannie mae and freddie mac  and private label conduit programs with institutional participants and iii commercial mortgage loan servicing through amresco services

retained interests in securitizations are classified as trading and are carried at estimated fair market value 
changes in such market value are included in earnings 
cash flows for retained interests in securitizations are generally subordinated to other security holders in a securitization trust 
the retained interests in securitizations are valued at the discounted present value of the cash flows based upon the expected timing of the release of the cash by the securitization trust cash out method over the anticipated life of the assets sold after estimated future credit losses  estimated prepayments and normal servicing and other related fees 
the discounted present value of such retained interests is computed using management s assumptions of market discount rates  prepayment rates  default rates  credit losses and other costs 
the carrying value of the retained interests in securitizations is determined by the company on a disaggregated basis and considers historical prepayment and loss experience  economic conditions and trends  collateral values and other relevant factors 
the actual weighted average annual prepayment rate on the company s home equity securitizations was for the period from inception of each security through december   which is slightly higher than originally projected  and is estimated to be for the next twelve months 
prepayment rates on the company s franchise and small business loan securitizations have been consistent with original expectations 
current valuations take into account the change in prepayment assumptions as well as other assumptions influenced by market conditions 
the discount rate used to value the retained interests is influenced primarily by the underlying loan rate and the volatility and predictability of the underlying cash flows which generally become more certain as the securities season 
the weighted average discount rate used to value the company s retained interests at december  was 
the company has utilized  for initial valuation purposes in  a discount rate on its home equity securitizations  discount rates ranging from for its commercial finance franchise loan securitizations and a discount rate on its commercial finance small business loan securitizations 
as discussed  the estimated market rate changes over time to reflect management s estimate of market rates 
the lower discount rate on the commercial finance securitizations were due to the reduced risk related to a borrower cross collateralization feature in these securitizations

year general many of the world s computers  software programs and other equipment using microprocessors or embedded chips currently have date fields that use two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
these computers  programs and chips may be unable to properly interpret dates beyond the year  for example  computer software that has date sensitive programming using a two digit format may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year such errors could potentially result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in similar normal business activities  which  in turn  could lead to disruptions in the company s operations or performance 
the company s assessments of the cost and timeliness of completion of year modifications set forth below are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions relating to future events  including  without limitation  the continued availability of certain internal and external resources and third party readiness plans 
furthermore  as the company s year initiative described below progresses  the company continues to revise its estimates of the likely problems and costs associated with the year problem and to adapt its contingency plan 
however  there can be no assurance that any estimate or assumption will prove to be accurate 
the company s year initiative the company is conducting a comprehensive year initiative with respect to its internal business critical systems 
this initiative encompasses information technology it systems and applications  as well as non it systems and equipment with embedded technology  such as fax machines and telephone systems  which may be impacted by the year problem 
business critical systems encompass internal accounting systems  including general ledger  accounts payable and financial reporting applications  cash management systems  loan servicing systems  and decision support systems  as well as the underlying technology required to support the software 
the initiative includes assessing  remediating or replacing  testing and upgrading the company s business critical it systems with the assistance of a consulting firm that specializes in year readiness 
based upon a review of the completed and planned stages of the initiative  and the testing done to date  the company does not anticipate any material difficulties in achieving year readiness with respect to its internal business critical systems  and the company anticipates that year readiness with respect to virtually all its internal business critical systems will be achieved by march in addition to its own internal it systems and non it systems  the company may be at risk from year failures caused by or occurring to third parties 
these third parties can be classified into two groups 
the first group includes borrowers  significant business partners  lenders  vendors and other service providers with whom the company has a direct contractual relationship 
the second group  while encompassing certain members of the first group  is comprised of third parties providing services or functions to large segments of society  both domestically and internationally such as airlines  utilities and national stock exchanges 
as is the case with most other companies  the actions the company can take to avoid any adverse effects from the failure of companies  particularly those in the second group  to become year ready is extremely limited 
however  the company is in the process of communicating with those companies that have significant business relationships with the company  particularly those in the first group  to determine their year readiness status and the extent to which the company could be affected by any of their year readiness issues 
in connection with this process  the company is seeking to obtain written representations and other independent confirmations of year readiness from the third parties with whom the company has material contracts 
responses from all third parties having material contracts with the company have not been received 
in addition to contacting these third parties  where there are direct interfaces between the company s systems and the systems of these third parties in the first group  the company plans to conduct testing in the second quarter of in conformance with the guidelines of the federal financial institutions examination council 
based on responses received and testing to date  it is not currently anticipated that the company will be materially affected by any third party year readiness issues 
for all business critical systems interfaces  readiness is scheduled to be achieved by march  significant third party service providers that have not completed their year initiatives by march  are scheduled to be replaced with comparable firms that are believed to be compliant 
the company anticipates that this portion of its year initiative will be completed within the scheduled time periods 
there can be no assurance that the systems of the company or those of third parties will be timely converted 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a failure to convert by another company  or a conversion that is not compatible with the company s systems or those of other companies on which the company s systems rely  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not anticipate that it will incur material expenditures in connection with any modifications necessary to achieve year readiness 
the company estimates that it has incurred approximately  of costs related to its year initiative through december   and the company anticipates that it will incur approximately  of costs in the future with respect to the initiative 
these cost estimates do not include costs associated with internal resources assigned to the initiative 
potential risks in addition to the company s internal systems and the systems and embedded technology of third parties with whom the company does business  there is a general uncertainty regarding the overall success of global remediation efforts relating to the year problem  including those efforts of providers of services to large segments of society  as described above in the second group 
due to the interrelationships on a global scale that may be impacted by the year problem  there could be short term disruptions in the capital or real estate markets or longer term disruptions that would affect the overall economy 
due to the general uncertainty with respect to how this issue will affect businesses and governments  it is not possible to list all potential problems or risks associated with the year problem 
however  some examples of problems or risks to the company that could result from the failure by third parties to adequately deal with the year problem include in the case of lenders  the potential for liquidity stress due to disruptions in funding flows  in the case of exchanges and clearing agents  the potential for funding disruptions and settlement failures  and in the case of vendors or providers  service failures or interruptions  such as failures of power  telecommunications and the embedded technology of building systems such as hvac  sprinkler and fire suppression  elevators  alarm monitoring and security  and building and parking garage access 
with respect to the company s loan portfolios  risks due to the potential failure of third parties to be ready to deal with the year problem include potential borrower defaults resulting from computer failures of retail systems of major tenants in retail commercial real estate properties such as shopping malls and strip shopping centers  potential borrower defaults resulting from increased expenses or legal claims related to failures of embedded technology in building systems  such as hvac  sprinkler and fire suppression  elevators  alarm monitoring and security  and building and parking garage access  and delays in reaching projected occupancy levels due to construction delays  interruptions in service or other market factors 
these risks are also applicable to the company s portfolios of mbs  as these securities are dependent upon the pool of mortgage loans underlying them 
if the investors in these types of securities demand higher returns in recognition of these potential risks  the market value of any future mbs portfolios of the company also could be adversely affected 
other problems that could result from the failure of the company or third parties to achieve year readiness include impairment of the company s ability to report to investors and owners with respect to portfolio performance and collect and remit payments  including those with respect to return on investments  taxes and insurance 
furthermore  the company s loan servicing operations rely on computers to process and manage loans 
these operations are of such a volume and nature that manual processing would be time consuming and expensive 
therefore  a failure of the company s own systems or the systems provided by third parties and used by the company to be timely compliant could have a material adverse effect on the company s loan servicing operations 
the company believes that the risks most likely to affect the company adversely relate to the failure of third parties  including its borrowers and sources of capital  to achieve year readiness 
if its borrowers systems fail  the result could be a delay in making payments to the company or the complete business failure of such borrowers 
the failure  although believed to be unlikely  of the company s sources of capital to achieve year readiness could result in the company being unable to obtain the funds necessary to continue its normal business operations 
some of the risks associated with the year problem may be mitigated through insurance maintained or purchased by the company  its business partners  borrowers and vendors 
however  the scope of insurance coverage in addressing these potential issues under existing policies has yet to be tested  and the economic impact on the solvency of the insurers has not been explored 
therefore  no assurance can be given that insurance coverage will be available or  if it is available  that it will be available on a cost effective basis or that it will cover all or a significant portion of any potential loss 
business continuity disaster recovery plan the company currently has a business continuity disaster recovery plan that includes business resumption processes that do not rely on computer systems and the maintenance of hard copy files  where appropriate 
the business continuity disaster recovery plan is monitored and updated as potential year readiness issues of the company and third parties are specifically identified 
due to the inability to predict all of the potential problems that may arise in connection with the year problem  there can be no assurance that all contingencies will be adequately addressed by such plan 
private litigation securities reform act of this report contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following industry conditions and competition  interest rates  business mix  availability of additional financing  and the risks described from time to time in the company s reports to the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management procedures extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures as of december   including a discussion of how those exposures are managed 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk due to the company s balance sheet being primarily comprised of loans and interest bearing investments primarily financed by libor based notes payable and warehouse loans payable 
the company manages this risk by striving to balance its origination and mortgage banking activities with its asset management and servicing operations which are generally counter cyclical in nature 
in addition  the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to hedge against changes in interest rates 
the company may reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are used to lower funding costs  to diversify sources of funding  or to alter interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor is the company party to highly leveraged derivatives 
these financial instruments include interest rate cap agreements  put options and forward and futures contracts 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the company controls the risk of its hedging agreements  interest rate cap agreements and forward and futures contracts through approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
the company purchases interest rate cap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt 
the company enters into these agreements to change the fixed variable interest rate mix of the debt portfolio to reduce the company s aggregate risk to movements in interest rates 
accordingly  the company enters into agreements to effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt to reduce the company s risk of incurring higher interest costs due to rising interest rates 
the cap agreements entitle the company to receive from the counterparties the amounts  if any  by which an interest rate index exceeds agreed upon thresholds 
the potential loss in fair value related to such cap agreements resulting from a adverse change in interest rates is not material 
futures and forward contracts are commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments at a future date for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery 
initial margin requirements are met in cash or other instruments 
futures contracts have little credit risk because futures exchanges are the counterparties 
forward agreements and interest rate swaps and caps are subject to the creditworthiness of the counterparties  which are principally large financial institutions 
interest rate sensitivity analyses are used to measure the company s interest rate risk related to its trading and other than trading portfolios by computing hypothetical changes in fair values of interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a hypothetical changes in interest rates 
the following are the company s interest rate sensitivity analyses as of december  dollars in millions retained interests in securitization trading change in hypothetical hypothetical interest rates fair value change change a hypothetical increase in interest rates is projected to decrease loan pre payments increasing the fair value of the retained interests 
this increase is projected to more than offset a decrease in fair value of the retained interests caused by higher market interest rates 
other than trading change in hypothetical hypothetical interest rates fair value change change the other than trading category includes loans held for sale  loans and asset portfolios  asset backed securities  derivative positions  senior notes  senior subordinated notes and the amount outstanding under the company s credit agreement to the extent the fair value could be affected by a widening of spreads 
in an increasing interest rate environment  the company projects the fair value of its debt obligations to decrease offset  in part  by a fair value reduction in its asset and derivative portfolio 
any market interest rate change would adjust the company s projected cash flows from its variable rate assets and liabilities 
such changes in cash flows are not reflected in the above analysis as the fair values of variable assets and liabilities would not materially be affected by a change in interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re pricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates related to certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates while changes in interest rates related to other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as variable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
additionally  changes in market interest rates may increase or decrease due to pre payments and defaults influenced by changes in market interest rates affecting the valuation of certain assets 
accordingly  the data presented in the above table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
the company is subject to foreign exchange risk to the extent its income bearing assets exceeds its related foreign denominated debt 
at december   the company had no derivative contracts in place to hedge against foreign exchange rate exposure 
the following table summarizes the hypothetical impact to the company s financial position due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates dollars in millions change in foreign exchange rates hypothetical hypothetical per dollar fair value change change other market risks as with any entity s investment or asset portfolio  the company is subject to the risk that certain unpredictable conditions can exist which combine to have the effect of limiting the company s ability to liquidate its assets through sale or securitization 
as was the case in late when unprecedented market conditions caused a widening of interest rate spreads resulting in losses to the company and substantial requirements on the company s liquidity position  certain events  however remote a possibility  can again exist reducing the company s ability to liquidate certain assets 
the company believes its exposure to this liquidity risk is remote and would not be present under a scenario of a change in interest rates
