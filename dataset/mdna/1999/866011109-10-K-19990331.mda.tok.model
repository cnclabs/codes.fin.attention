item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the corporation analyzes the major elements of the corporation s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
performance summary 
net income for was million  an increase of million  or  over the million recorded for on a weighted average share basis  net income for was per diluted share as compared to per share for  an increase of 
the major contribution to the improved earnings during was a increase in net interest income 
also contributing to the increase in net income was a decrease in the provision for loan losses of  and an increase of  in non interest income 
partially offsetting these increases was an increase in non interest expenses of  further explanations of these changes are set forth below 
continuing to reflect the strong and growing economy in the corporation s market area  loans increased over the previous year end to million at december  deposits experienced even more dramatic growth  particularly in the fourth quarter  increasing over the same period to million 
shareholders equity was million at year end  an increase of 
net income for was million compared to net income of million for  an increase of 
the increase in earnings for was also attributable to a significant increase net interest income 
the following table shows selected key performance ratios over the last three years return on average assets return on average shareholders equity shareholders equity to assets average dividend payout ratio per diluted share the ratio  return on assets  is calculated by dividing net income by average total assets for the year 
the return on equity ratio is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders equity for the year 
the equity to assets ratio is calculated by dividing average shareholders equity by average total assets for the year 
the dividend payout is determined by dividing the dividend paid per share by the diluted earnings per share 
net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid for the funds supporting those assets 
the largest category of earning assets consists of loans to businesses and individuals 
the second largest is investment securities 
net interest income is the principal source of the corporation s earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities supporting those assets  affect net interest income 
interest rates primarily are determined by national and international market trends  as well as competitive pressures in the corporation s operating markets 
for analytical purposes  income from tax exempt assets  primarily securities issued by or loans made to state and local governments  is adjusted by an increment which equates tax exempt income to interest from taxable assets 
net interest income tax equivalent for was million  an increase of million  or compared to the prior year 
the net increase reflected a million increase in interest income which was offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the corporation s yield on earning assets declined to in  from for rates paid on the corporation s interest bearing liabilities  increased from in to in these negative shifts in yield on earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities resulted in the net interest margin declining from in to for however  an increase in average earning assets more than offset the decline in net interest margin 
also  contributing to the improved net interest income for was the increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits 
in  the average balance of demand deposits increased 
although the average demand deposits as a percent of average total deposits declined to in from in this ratio remains very positive compared to the corporation s peers 
summary of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities although the year end detail provides satisfactory indicators of general trends  the daily average balance sheets are more meaningful for analysis purposes than year end data because averages reflect the day to day fluctuations that are common to bank balance sheets 
also  average balances for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can be related directly to the components of interest income and interest expense on the statements of income 
this provides the basis for analysis of rates earned and paid  and sources of increases and decreases in net interest income as derived from changes in volumes and rates 
the following schedule presents average balance sheets for the most recent three years in a format that highlights earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

presented on a tax equivalent basis t e using a federal income tax rate of in all three years 
net interest margin  the net return on earning assets which is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets  was for  a nineteen basis point decline from the previous year 
this decline in the margin reflected a lower yield on earning assets contributed to by a declining interest rate market in the fourth quarter of and a more competitive economic market that resulted in somewhat lower pricing of some loans 
also  competitive market conditions resulted in higher rates being paid on deposit products  along with a shift by the corporation s customers to higher interest rate deposit products 
the table below analyzes the increase in net interest income for each of the years ended december  and on a fully tax equivalent basis 
non accruing loans have been included in assets for these computations  thereby reducing yields on total loans

in this same period total interest income increased and total interest expense increased 
non interest income 
non interest income is an important contributor to net earnings 
the major component of the corporation s non interest income is various charges and fees earned on deposit accounts and related services 
the following table summarizes the changes in non interest income during the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount service charges on deposit accounts    non recurring income gain loss on sale of investment securities other non interest income    total non interest income    service charges on deposits increased in as a result of an increase in the various service fees charged on deposit accounts and an increase in the number of accounts 
the non recurring income in included  from refunds of state franchise taxes paid in prior years   from gains on sales of assets taken in satisfaction of debts in prior years and  of interest recovered on loans either charged off in prior years or loans that were on non accural status in prior years 
non recurring income in and is primarily interest recovered on loans charged off in prior years and gains on sales of miscellaneous assets 
the increase in other non interest income in is primarily due to income from two new products  debit cards and mortgage brokerage origination  partially offset by lower fees earned on investment services to customers 
excluding non recurring income and gains and losses on securities  non interest income increased in and in non interest expense 
non interest expense includes all expenses of the corporation other than interest expense  provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
the following table summarizes the changes in the non interest expenses for the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount salaries and employee benefits    occupancy expense net furniture and equipment expense  other real estate owned expense other expenses business development insurance other legal and professional fees other taxes postage and courier 
printing and supplies regulatory fees and assessments other operating expenses  total other expenses    total non interest expense    total non interest expense increased in over reflecting increases in salaries and benefits  occupancy expenses  furniture and equipment expenses  other taxes and other operating expenses 
as a percent of average assets  non interest expenses were in and the efficiency ratio non interest expenses divided by total non interest income plus net interest income was for the efficiency ratio measures what percentage of total revenues are absorbed by non interest expense 
these measures of operating efficiency compare very favorably to other financial institutions in the corporation s peer groups 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits for is due to salary merit increases and additions to staff 
the average number of full time equivalent employees increased by in to an average full time equivalent of at year end the full time equivalent staff was versus at the same time the prior year 
the increases for salaries and number of employees include additions for a branch office opened in also  several lending officers and customer service officers and employees were added in the last half of and were on staff for the full year of the increase in occupancy expense includes the rent for a new branch office that was opened in the fourth quarter of also  increases of approximately  in the aggregate  were experienced in utilities expense  repairs expense and ad valorem tax expense in current facilities 
the increase in furniture and equipment expense is primarily a result of depreciation and service contract expense for a new computer network system installed in mid as well as  new item processing equipment added in late also  expenses related to a new branch office opened in are reflected 
other taxes  primarily franchise taxes paid to the state of texas were higher due to higher levels of taxable capital at all entities and the loss of certain tax credits that were available in prior years 
as noted in the discussion of non interest income  tax refunds were received for the tax years of through by filing amended returns to reflect new interpretations of taxable capital 
these new interpretations should assist in maintaining somewhat lower taxes in future years 
other operating expenses increased in due to an increase in various miscellaneous operating costs including telephone service fees  atm support expenses  third party data processing support fees  and travel expenses

loans 
the following schedule classifies loans according to type as of december for the past five years dollars in thousands december  of of of of of total total total total total commercial      real estate mortgage      real estate construction      loans to individuals  net of unearned discount      total loans  net of unearned income      the preceding loan distribution table reflects that total loans increased million between year end and although this dollar increase was significant  the corporation is continuing to apply stringent credit criteria on all loan applications 
at december   loans were of deposits compared to at the previous year end reflecting an above average increase in deposits in the fourth quarter of however  average loans were of average deposits in compared to in primarily  the commercial loan customers of the subsidiary banks are small to medium sized businesses and professionals and executives 
the banks offer a variety of commercial loan products that include revolving lines of credit  letters of credit  working capital loans and loans to finance accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
generally  these commercial loans have floating rates of interest with terms of maturity of three years or less 
a significant portion of the million real estate mortgage portfolio is loans to finance owner occupied real estate 
at december   million of loans  approximately of the real estate mortgage portfolio  had been made for this purpose 
also  approximately of the loans in the real estate mortgage portfolio have variable rates of interest with a significant portion of the remaining portfolio having balloon terms at five to seven years and or rate adjustment clauses 
real estate construction loans are made primarily to finance construction of single family residences in the corporation s market area of tarrant county 
construction loans generally are secured by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates 
the corporation s lending activities in this area are primarily with borrowers that have been in the building trade for many years and with which the banks have long standing relationships 
the corporation s lending officers meet quarterly with consultants that carefully track the residential building activities within the market 
the corporation will adjust its construction lending activities based on the trends of housing starts and absorption rates in the market 
the corporation also lends to consumers for purchases of various consumer goods  such as automobiles  boats and home improvements 
the terms of these loans typically are five years or less and are well secured with liens on products purchased or other assets 
these loans are primarily made to customers who have other relationships with the banks 
the corporation does not issue credit cards and does not have any credit card loans outstanding 
the following table presents commercial loans and real estate construction loans at december   based on scheduled principal repayments and the total amount of loans due after one year classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates in thousands over one year one year through over five or less five years years total commercial     real estate construction     totals     of the loans maturing after one year  all have fixed rates of interest  with many having rate adjustment clauses during the remaining term of the loan that allow for periodic adjustments to rates 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible are charged against this allowance and subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance represents the amount which  in management s judgement  will be adequate to absorb future charge offs of existing loans which may become uncollectible 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined by management s periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio and by the employment of third party loan review specialists 
all known problem loans  unknown inherent risks generally associated with bank lending  past loan loss experience  delinquency ratios and current and projected economic conditions are taken into account in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance 
the corporation has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure sfas no 

these standards specify how allowances for certain impaired loans should be determined and the accounting for in substance foreclosures 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not both well secured and in the process of collection  or immediately  if in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely

the decrease in provision for loan losses in over primarily recognizes the significant increase in reserve to loans ratio in the prior year vs and a lower rate of growth in loans 
the following table reflects the allowance for loan losses compared to total loans at the end of each year dollars in thousands december  total loans      allowance for loan losses      allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the following table illustrates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the various loan categories dollars in thousands  see the tables on page for the percent of specific types of loans to total loans december  amount total amount total amount total amount total amount total allowance for loan losses commercial     real estate mortgage real estate construction loans to individuals unallocated portion   total      the allocation is determined by providing specific reserves against each criticized loan plus a general allocation against the remaining balance of the portfolio based on experience factors 
management of the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain loan losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the current allowance 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of loans 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  renegotiated loans and other real estate 
non accrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended and on which the interest is recorded as earned when it is received 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest is past due days or more  and the loan is not both well secured and in the process of collection  or immediately  if in the opinion of management  full collection of principal or interest is doubtful 
at the time a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest previously recorded but not collected is reversed and charged against current interest income 
renegotiated loans are loans on which the interest and or the principal has been reduced due to a deterioration in the borrower s financial condition 
even though these loans are actually performing  they are included in non performing assets because of the loss of revenue related to the reduction of interest and or principal 
other real estate is real estate acquired through foreclosure or through partial settlement of debts and which is awaiting sale and disposition 
at the time of acquisition  other real estate is recorded at the lower of estimated fair value or the loan balance or settlement agreement with any write down charged to the allowance for loan losses 
any further write downs  expenses related to the property  and any gain or loss resulting from the sale of the property are recorded in current operating expenses 
the following table summarizes the non performing assets and loans days past due and still accruing as of december  dollars in thousands december  non accrual loans    renegotiated loans other real estate total non performing assets      as a percent of total assets 



total loans and other real estate 



loans past due days or more and still accruing the subsidiary banks are required  by the regulatory authorities  to have other real estate evaluated periodically 
in the event the new evaluation value is less than the carrying value of the property  the excess is written off to expense 
some properties are written down below their evaluation values when management feels the economic value of the property has declined below the evaluation value 
non accrual loans at december   were comprised of  in commercial loans   in real estate mortgages   in interim construction loans and  to consumers 
within the non accrual commercial loans is one loan of  that is performing as to payment of principal and interest  however  the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty due to their line of business health insurance underwriting 
the non accrual interim construction loans includes a commercial construction loan for  to a borrower that is in bankruptcy 
in january  the property was foreclosed 
the property has been appraised at a value above the loan value  therefore the foreclosed asset was recorded at the loan value at foreclosure 
the impact on interest income from the above non accrual loans and renegotiated loans for the past five years is provided below in thousands years ended december  gross amount of interest that would have been recorded at original rate interest included in income interest not recorded in income loans of each subsidiary bank are graded on a system similar to that used by the regulators 
the first level of criticized loans is other assets especially mentioned oaem 
these loans are normally fundamentally sound but have potential weaknesses which may  if not corrected  weaken the asset or inadequately protect the bank s credit position at some future date 
the second level is substandard  which are loans inadequately protected by current sound net worth  paying capacity or pledged collateral 
the last level of criticized loans  before they are charged off  is doubtful 
doubtful loans are considered to have inherent weaknesses because collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable 
non accrual loans normally include weaker substandard loans and loans that are considered to be doubtful 
the following table summarizes the relationship between non performing loans  criticized loans and the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands december  non performing loans    criticized loans      allowance for loan losses      allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans criticized loans independent third party loan reviews of the subsidiary banks were completed at various times in in addition  regulatory examinations were completed in early based on the findings of these reviews and exams the subsidiary banks appear to be adequately reserved 
management is not aware of any potential loan problems  that have not been disclosed  to which serious doubts exist as to the ability of the borrower to substantially comply with the present repayment terms 
deposits 
the primary source of the corporation s funds is the deposits of the subsidiary banks 
the majority of the corporation s deposits are considered core deposits  that is  deposits that are not subject to material changes due to customer withdrawal because of market rate changes 
the corporation does not accept brokered deposits 
average demand deposits increased million  or in these deposits represented of total deposits 
average interest bearing deposits increased million  or 
the deposit types daily average balance and related average rates paid during each of the last three years are as follows dollars in thousands amount rate paid amount rate paid amount rate paid noninterest bearing demand deposits    interest bearing deposits interest bearing transaction accounts    savings    savings certificates    certificates of deposit of  or more    other time deposits total interest bearing deposits    total deposits    the remaining maturity on certificates of deposit of  or more as of december   and is presented below in thousands of of of maturity total total total months or less   to months    to months   over months    borrowings 
securities sold under repurchase agreements generally represent borrowings with maturities ranging from one to thirty days 
these borrowings are with significant commercial customers of the banks that require short term liquidity for their funds 
information relating to these borrowings is summarized as follows december  securities sold under repurchase agreements average    year end    maximum month end balance during year    interest rate average year end interest rate sensitivity 
the objectives of monitoring and managing the interest rate risk of the balance sheet are to contribute to earnings by minimizing adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates and to provide liquidity to satisfy cash flow requirements to meet customers fluctuating demands 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in the market interest rates and changes in net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an asset sensitive position in a given period will result in more assets than liabilities being subject to repricing  therefore  market interest rate changes will be reflected more quickly in asset rates 
if interest rates decline  such a position will have an adverse effect on net interest income 
conversely  in a liability sensitive position  where liabilities reprice more quickly than assets in a given period  a decline in market rates will benefit net interest income 
a mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in which relatively equal volumes reprice each period represents a matched interest sensitivity gap position  any excess of these assets or liabilities results in an interest sensitive gap 
the following table  commonly referred to as a static gap report  indicates the interest rate sensitivity position at december  and may not be reflective of positions in subsequent periods dollars in thousands repriced due in after due in due in total year or days days rate non rate or less days to one year sensitive sensitive total earning assets loans       investment securities       federal funds sold    total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts and savings    certificates of deposits        other time deposits       repurchase agreements    total interest bearing liabilities       interest sensitivity gap       cumulative gap    cumulative gap to total earning assets cumulative gap to total assets in the preceding table under the after year category   in investment securities will reprice or mature within one to three years and another  will reprice or mature within three to five years 
the average maturity of the investment portfolio is approximately years 
also  the above table reflects the call dates versus maturity dates and periodic principal amortization of investment securities 
the preceding static gap report reflects a cumulative liability sensitive position during the one year horizon 
an inherent weakness of this report is that it ignores the relative volatility any one category may have in relation to other categories or market rates in general 
for instance  the rate paid on certain interest bearing transaction accounts typically moves slower than the three month t bill 
management attempts to capture this relative volatility by utilizing a simulation model with a beta factor adjustment which estimates the volatility of rate sensitive assets and or liabilities in relation to other market rates 
beta factors are an estimation of the long term  multiple interest rate environment relation between an individual account and market rates in general 
for instance  now  savings and money market accounts  which are repriceable within days will have considerably lower beta factors than variable rate loans and most investment categories 
taking this into consideration  it is quite possible for a bank with a negative cumulative gap to total asset ratio to have a positive beta adjusted gap risk position 
as a result of applying the beta factors established by the corporation s management to the earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in the static gap report via a simulation model  the cumulative gap to total assets ratio at one year of was reversed to a positive beta adjusted gap position 
management feels that the beta adjusted gap risk technique more accurately reflects the corporation s gap position 
also  based on the corporation s analysis of its interest rate sensitivity position at year end  a basis point change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on its net interest income over a twelve month period 
the following table reflects the spreads and margins for the past three years yield on earning assets t e cost of funds net interest spread t e net interest margin t e capital resources 
at december  shareholders equity totaled million  an increase of million or for the year 
this increase was primarily from retained earnings  ie  earnings net of dividends to shareholders and the impact of the repurchase of shares of the corporation 
bank regulatory authorities have established risk based capital guidelines for us banking organizations 
the objective of these efforts is to provide a more consistent system for comparing capital positions of banking organizations and to reflect the level of risk associated with holding various categories of assets 
the guidelines define tier capital and tier capital 
the only components of tier and tier capital  for the corporation  are equity capital and equity capital plus a portion of the allowance for loan losses  respectively 
the guidelines also stipulate that four categories of risk weights    and percent  primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty  be applied to the different types of balance sheet assets 
risk weights for all off balance sheet exposures are determined by a two step process whereas the face value of the off balance sheet item is converted to a credit equivalent amount and that amount is assigned to the appropriate risk category 
off balance sheet items at december  and included unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
the minimum ratio for qualifying total capital is percent  of which percent must be tier capital 
the federal reserve board and the comptroller of the currency also have a capital to total assets leverage guideline 
these guidelines establish a minimum level of tier capital to total assets of percent 
a banking organization operating at or near these levels is expected to have well diversified risk  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings and in general be considered a strong banking organization 
organizations not meeting these characteristics are expected to operate well above these minimum capital standards 
thus  for all but the most highly rated organizations  the minimum tier leverage ratio is to be percent plus minimum additional cushions of at least to basis points 
at the discretion of the regulatory authorities  additional capital may be required 
the table below illustrates the corporation s and its subsidiary banks compliance with the regulatory guidelines as of december  dollars in thousands the summit summit consolidated national community corporation bank bank  na total assets    risk weighted assets    equity capital tier    qualifying allowance for loan losses    total tier capital    leverage ratio risk capital ratio tier total tier capital the corporation had an unrealized gain on available for sale securities  net of deferred taxes  of  as of december  under regulatory requirements  the unrealized gain or loss on available for sale securities is not included in the calculation of risk based capital 
as can be seen in the preceding table  the corporation and its subsidiary banks exceed the risk based capital and leverage requirements set by the regulators as of december  also  as of december   the corporation and its subsidiary banks met the criteria for classification as a well capitalized institution under the rules of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia 
impact of inflation 
the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the corporation s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  investments  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the corporation attempts to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
liquidity 
liquidity is defined as the corporation s ability to meet deposit withdrawals  provide for the legitimate credit needs of customers  and take advantage of certain investment opportunities as they arise 
while maintaining adequate liquid assets to fulfill these functions  it must also maintain compatible levels of maturity and rate concentrations between its sources of funds and earning assets 
the liability structure of the corporation is short term in nature and the asset structure is likewise oriented towards short maturities 
the corporation s primary internal source of liquidity is its federal funds sold and its marketable investment securities  particularly those with shorter maturities 
at december   federal funds sold and investment securities maturing within days represented million or of total assets 
additionally  the corporation s ability to sell loan participations and purchase federal funds serves as secondary sources of liquidity 
each of the subsidiary banks have approved federal funds lines at other banks 
the liquidity of the corporation is enhanced by the fact that of total deposits at december   were core deposits 
core deposits for this purpose are defined as total deposits less public funds and certificates of deposit greater than  the parent corporation s income  which provides funds for the payment of dividends to shareholders and for other corporate purposes  is derived from the investment in its subsidiaries and from management fees paid by the subsidiaries 
see note dividends from subsidiaries for limitations on dividends payable by subsidiaries 
impact of the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the corporation s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities 
based on assessments  the corporation determined that it would be required to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the corporation presently believes that with modifications to existing software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications are not made  or are not completed timely  the year issue could have material impact on the operations of the corporation 
the corporation has utilized both internal and external resources to correct and test the software for year modifications 
the corporation has substantially completed the year project 
the remaining work on the project includes finalization of the corporation s contingency plans should any area not function as tested or any external event impact the operation of the corporation 
the total cost of the year project has not been material to the financial condition of the corporation 
forward looking statements 
the corporation may from time to time make forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to earnings per share  credit quality  expected year compliance program  corporate objectives and other financial and business matters 
the corporation cautions the reader that these forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including economic conditions  actions taken by the federal reserve board  legislative and regulatory actions and reforms  competition  as well as other reasons  all of which change over time 
actual results may differ materially from forward looking statements
