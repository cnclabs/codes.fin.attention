introduction vestcom international  inc was incorporated in september concurrently with the consummation of vestcom s initial public offering the offering on august   vestcom acquired seven companies that create  manage and distribute business critical documents the founding companies each of which had been operating as a separate independent entity 
for accounting purposes  the acquisitions of the founding companies were deemed to be made august   using purchase accounting  with vestcom as the acquirer 
since the offering  vestcom has acquired additional companies that create  manage and distribute business critical documents  as detailed below collectively with the founding companies referred to herein as acquired companies 
vestcom acquired substantially all of the assets of new england laser printing  inc now known as vestcom rhode island  inc 
in november   and the stock of moreau promotional services  inc now known as vestcom canada in december as of january  vestcom acquired substantially all of the assets of creative data services  inc cds and db acquisition inc 
doing business as business mail express bme  a wholly owned subsidiary of cds  and on april  vestcom acquired substantially all of the assets of dee cee graphics inc dee cee 
the operations of dee cee were consolidated into vestcom massachusetts operations 
on august   vestcom  acquired substantially all of the assets of graphic technology systems  inc gts 
the operations of gts were consolidated into vestcom s retail solutions operations 
on october   vestcom acquired substantially all of the assets of manus services corporation manus  a company based in seattle  washington 
the acquired companies were managed prior to their acquisition as independent private companies  and their results of operations reflect different tax structures s corporations and c corporations for the us acquired companies  which have influenced  among other things  the acquired companies historical levels of owners compensation 
in connection with the acquisition of the acquired companies  these owners and certain key employees agreed to certain reductions in their compensation which commenced as of the date of acquisition 
vestcom s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes the founding companies and vestcom rhode island  inc  vestcom canada  cds  bme  dee cee  gts and manus 
the results of operations and statement of cash flows for the year ended december   include the results of vestcom and all of the companies acquired in for the entire period  and the companies acquired in from their respective dates of acquisition 
in connection with vestcom s acquisitions  vestcom has made certain earnout payments and may be required to pay an additional earnout if specified revenue thresholds  margins or earnings are attained during the period ending july  in connection with a determination of earnouts for two of the founding companies  in april  vestcom paid  in cash  incurred an obligation to pay  in cash and issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the company paid  of the  obligation in september and the remaining  in march in february  vestcom paid  and in march  issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in connection with the determination of an earnout for another founding company 
in march  vestcom paid  issued a note payable for  at interest due in january  and issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock in connection with the determination of an earnout of an acquired company 
after the april  september  february and march payments  the aggregate maximum earnout payments which vestcom may be required to make going forward are  in cash 
any payments of earnouts will increase the goodwill recorded for the acquisition of the applicable company 
the amortization of any additional goodwill and the increased number of shares issued in connection with earnouts will negatively affect vestcom s future earnings per share 
vestcom  which conducted no operations prior to the consummation of the offering other than in connection with the acquisitions of the founding companies and the financing activities related thereto  including the offering  had no revenues and limited corporate expenses in the first seven months of therefore  management s discussion and analysis based on actual results would compare twelve months of operating activity in to five months of operating activity in to no operating activity in accordingly  management believes that management s discussion and analysis would only be meaningful based on a comparison of the audited results of operations of vestcom for the year ended december   to the unaudited pro forma results of operations of vestcom for the years ended december  and december  the unaudited pro forma data give effect to i the acquisitions of the founding companies and vestcom rhode island and vestcom canada  and ii compensation and other adjustments for all transactions as if the transactions had occurred on january  and january   respectively 
the following discussion of pro forma results of operations is not necessarily indicative of the results vestcom would have obtained had all of these acquisitions actually then occurred or of vestcom s actual or future results 
actual unaudited pro forma audited results of operations in thousands in thousands revenues    gross profit    selling  general administrative expenses    income from operations    results of operations year ended december  compared to unaudited pro forma year ended december  in s revenues increased  or  from pro forma  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions which accounted for  or of revenues and  or internal growth over revenues 
this internal growth was due to increased sales to new and existing customers primarily in the financial services and retail markets 
vestcom s gross profit increased  or  from pro forma  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributed to acquisitions which accounted for approximately  with the remaining increase relating to the increased volume of business 
the gross profit margin decreased from in to in primarily due to the renegotiation of certain capital lease obligations with one of vestcom s vendors which reclassified certain of the obligations from capital leases to operating leases 
this transaction resulted in expense being moved from interest expense to cost of revenue thereby reducing the gross profit in selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  from pro forma  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expenses increased from in to in the increase was attributable in part to acquisitions which accounted for approximately  or of the total increase 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased compensation expense including increased commissions on higher sales  increased staffing for new technical and administrative personnel to support the greater volume of business  increased spending in sales and marketing programs and the costs associated with the increased vestcom corporate management staff 
the majority of the expenses of the vestcom corporate staff operations did not come into existence until after the consummation of the initial public offering in august of in addition  the company incurred costs in connection with its efforts to integrate its acquired companies 
these costs included redundant overhead and facility costs 
the company expects that it will continue to incur such costs in future periods in connection with its integration process 
pro forma year ended december  compared to the pro forma year ended december  in s pro forma revenues increased  or from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to increased volume of production of statements  point of purchase labels and other imaging services  although revenues also increased in other areas 
pro forma gross profit increased  or from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the pro forma gross profit margin increased from in to in primarily due to improved capacity utilization resulting from the increased volume of business and the refinancing through capital leases of certain existing production equipment which resulted in reduced lease and maintenance costs 
pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained constant at approximately in and pro forma income from operations increased  or from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  for the reasons discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources reflects vestcom s actual results of operations and financial position for the periods discussed 
on august  vestcom consummated its initial public offering of  shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
vestcom s underwriters exercised in full an option to purchase an additional  shares of vestcom s common stock at per share to cover over allotments of the initial public offering 
the capital raised by this offering was approximately  net of underwriting discounts  of which approximately  was used for the cash portion of vestcom s acquisitions and approximately  was used for the repayment of debt and capital leases 
at december   vestcom had working capital of approximately  as compared to  at december  the decrease is primarily attributed to acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   was approximately  and was generated primarily from net income and depreciation and amortization charges 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was approximately  which consisted of approximately  generated from the sale of marketable securities  approximately  of cash used for acquisitions  and approximately  used for the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   was approximately  which included approximately  from net borrowings and  from the issuance of common stock to former stockholders of certain of the founding companies in connection with earnout provisions 
on august   vestcom and summit bank entered into an equipment loan and revolving credit agreement the credit facility in the amount of  on december   approximately  was outstanding and  remained available under the credit facility 
vestcom incurs postage costs on behalf of customers of approximately  to  each month 
vestcom seeks to collect such postage costs from its customers in advance 
at december   vestcom had postage advances from customers in the amount of approximately  and had prepaid postage and postage receivables of approximately  to the extent vestcom is unsuccessful in obtaining postage costs in advance  cash flow is negatively affected and vestcom may be required to utilize its working capital or credit facility to cover the cash outlay 
capital expenditures of approximately  for property and equipment and leasehold improvements were made in these investments  which were financed primarily by working capital and vendor financing  relate to the facility consolidations of certain of the acquired companies and the purchase of supplemental production equipment to meet customer demands for business critical documents 
there are anticipated requirements for future capital expenditures in for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and equipment due to the opening of new facilities to support the consolidation and integration of production sites and the anticipated production equipment needs of the business 
at this time  these expenditures are estimated to be approximately  while no assurance can be given  management believes that its cash flow from operations combined with existing cash and the availability of funds under the credit facility  and potential additional credit capacity  will be sufficient to meet its working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements and its current plans to acquire additional related businesses for the foreseeable future 
the preceding sentence constitutes a forward looking statement 
impact of the year issue vestcom utilizes computer technologies in the form of both software and hardware including electronic digital printers to effectively carry out its day to day operations 
in addition to information technology  there is embedded computer technology in vestcom s facilities and equipment 
vestcom is utilizing a multi phased concurrent approach to determine whether its systems are capable of recognizing and processing date sensitive information properly as the year approaches 
the phases included in vestcom s approach are awareness  assessment  remediation  validation  implementation and contingency planning 
vestcom has separate plans to complete the year project for each operating unit  with central review and audit being performed by the headquarters organization 
all units have completed the awareness and assessment phases 
remediation  validation and implementation were near completion in all units at the end of full validation and implementation is scheduled to be complete by july since each vestcom unit uses many different kinds of computers  procedures to implement year corrections vary greatly 
each unit has a plan to test all year changes during the first half of this includes upgrades to mainframe hardware and software operating systems  laser printer software upgrades  microfiche and cd software replacements  pc replacements and financial software upgrades 
since vestcom processes data prepared by its customers  and does not have extensive date dependent proprietary software to repair or replace  management believes that the required changes to vestcom s systems will not be extensive 
vestcom has contacted its major software and hardware suppliers to verify that the systems vestcom uses are year compliant 
all major vendors have replied  and all vendors have either repaired  replaced or are in the process of upgrading hardware and software installed at vestcom 
most of the changes are complete  with some work to be completed during the first quarter of there can be no assurances that other companies systems on which vestcom s systems rely will be timely converted or that any such failure to convert by another company would not have a materially adverse effect on vestcom s systems 
certain of vestcom s customers may need to make appropriate changes to modify the data that they send to vestcom to make the information year compliant 
vestcom has assessed the extent to which its customers may experience year issues and has completed testing with certain major customers 
if customers or others with whom vestcom does business experience problems relating to the year issue  vestcom s business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
a loss of business could result from vestcom s customers inability to implement new work projects while focusing their information technology resources on year issues within their existing systems 
vestcom estimates that the aggregate cost of its year project will be approximately  including costs already incurred 
significant portions of these costs are not likely to be incremental costs  but rather will represent the redeployment of existing resources 
this reallocation of resources is not expected to have a significant impact on the day to day operations of vestcom 
vestcom incurred total costs of approximately  for this project during  of which about  was incremental expense 
major planned costs in are to cover the replacement of billing software and pc hardware 
the anticipated costs of the project  as well as the date on which vestcom expects to complete the project are based on management s best estimate using information currently available and numerous assumptions about future events 
however there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
based on its current estimates and information currently available vestcom does not anticipate that the costs associated with this project will have a material adverse effect on vestcom s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future 
the preceding sentence constitutes a forward looking statement 
in the event that the efforts of vestcom s year project do not address all relevant problems  vestcom has developed contingency plans 
vestcom uses multiple suppliers for most critical processes 
reliance on multiple suppliers lessens risk to any single critical business process 
in the limited cases where there is a single supplier  vestcom is performing extensive testing and planning for onsite support at year end to minimize the length and impact of an outage 
in addition  vestcom s decentralized operational structure allows for a single operating unit to have a software or hardware failure  while another unit can provide backup support 
this provides reduced risk if a single unit does not successfully complete the required changes to become year compliant as planned 
vestcom uses the services of many public utilities such as telecommunications common carriers  both local and long distance  water  gas  electrical power  and municipal services such as fire and security 
the company cannot effectively test these services for year readiness 
these organizations have made public statements regarding readiness for year and the company is unable to assess the accuracy of these statements 
since vestcom is located in many different geographic areas  and relies on many different public utility suppliers  the failure of one of these entities could affect the company 
vestcom is continuing its efforts to timely address the year issues 
actual results could differ materially from the forward looking statements contained herein as a result of a variety of factors  including potential unavailability of technological resources  increased expenses associated with obtaining such resources and unanticipated technological difficulties 
vestcom is currently evaluating the year readiness of the business and assets acquired from conversion printing systems  inc cps as of february  as such the above discussion does not reflect the impact of cps 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk vestcom s major market risk exposure is the effect of changing interest rates 
vestcom manages its interest expenses by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   vestcom s debt consisted of approximately  of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of and  of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on vestcom s cash requirements  maximum borrowings at any quarter end during were  if interest rates on such variable debt were to increase by basis points two tenths of the rate at december   the net impact of vestcom s results of operations and cash flows would be immaterial
