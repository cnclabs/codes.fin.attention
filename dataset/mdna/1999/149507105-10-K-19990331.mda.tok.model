during the first of quarter of  through march   the company purchased  shares for million

the company entered into a credit agreement with its primary lender in february and later amended it in march and june the credit facility presently consists of a million revolving  warehouse and term loan agreement 
the credit facility contains a revolving line of credit which provides for borrowings including letters of credit of up to and of the company s eligible as defined accounts receivable and inventories  respectively  up to a maximum of million 
interest is payable under the revolving line of credit at the bank s prime rate  or  if elected by the company  the day libor rate plus 
the warehouse and term loan agreements contained in the credit facility provide for borrowings of up to of the company s eligible as defined installment sales contracts  up to a maximum of million 
interest on the term notes is fixed for a period of five years from issuance at a rate based on the weekly average yield on five year treasury securities averaged over the preceding weeks  plus  with a floating rate for the remaining two years subject to certain limits equal to the bank s prime rate plus 
the warehouse component of the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million with interest payable at the bank s prime rate  or  if elected by the company  the day libor rate plus 
however  in no event may the aggregate outstanding borrowings under the warehouse and term loan agreement exceed million 
under the credit facility  no amounts were outstanding at december   and million was outstanding at december  the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants which limit  among other things  the company s ability to i make dividend payments and purchases of treasury stock in an aggregate amount which exceeds of consolidated net income for the two most recent years  ii mortgage or pledge assets which exceed  in the aggregate  million  iii incur additional indebtedness  including lease obligations  which exceed in the aggregate million and iv make capital expenditures in excess of million 
in addition  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants requiring the company to maintain on a consolidated basis certain defined levels of net working capital at least million  tangible net worth which must increase at least million per year  subject to a carryover for increases in excess of million in the prior year  debt to equity ratio not to exceed to and cash flow to debt service ratio not less than to 
the credit facility also requires cac to comply with certain specified restrictions and financial covenants 
since its inception  cac has been restricted in the amounts of loans it could purchase based on underwriting standards  as well as the availability of working capital and funds borrowed under its credit line with its primary lender 
in february  cac entered into an agreement with another lender providing for the periodic resale of a portion of cac s loans that meet established criteria 
in march  cac sold  under the retail finance agreement  a substantial portion of its then existing portfolio of loans 
the effect of this transaction on net income was to reduce the amount of financial services revenue from interest income on this portion of the portfolio  offset by reduced interest expense on retired debt and earnings on the remaining proceeds 
pursuant to the retail finance agreement  the company may sell a substantial portion of its existing installment loan portfolio in fiscal year  in addition to the periodic sale of installment contracts purchased by cac in the future 
the company believes the periodic sale of installment contracts under the retail finance agreement will reduce requirements for both working capital and borrowings  increase the company s liquidity  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and enhance the ability of cac to increase its volume of loan purchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional sales will be made under this agreement  or that cac and the company will be able to realize the expected benefits from such agreement 
the company s growth strategy currently includes the continued expansion of financial services  component supply operations  and its independent dealer network  the pursuit of additional acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition or opening of company owned retail locations 
the company currently believes existing cash and funds available under the credit facility  together with cash provided by operations  will be adequate to fund the company s operations and plans for the next twelve months 
in order to provide additional funds for continued pursuit of the company s growth strategies and for operations  the company may incur  from time to time  additional short and long term bank indebtedness or other forms of financing and may issue  in public or private transactions  its equity and debt securities  the availability and terms of which will depend upon market and other conditions 
the company may engage in other transactions  such as selling or securitizing all or portions of its installment loan portfolio  that are designed to facilitate the ability of the company to originate an increased volume of loans and to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and has entered into such a transaction pursuant to the retail finance agreement  as further described above 
there can be no assurance that such possible additional financing  or the aforementioned potential transactions involving the company s installment loan portfolio  will be available on terms acceptable to the company 
it is possible that a future lack of financing or a prolonged downturn in industry conditions could cause the company to curtail the expansion of financial services or otherwise alter its growth strategies 
impact of inflation the company generally has been able to increase its selling prices to offset increased costs  including the costs of raw materials 
sudden increases in costs as well as price competition  however  can affect the ability of the company to increase its selling prices 
as discussed above  the company currently is experiencing tightened supply of certain types of raw materials 
for a further discussion of this matter  see compared to gross profit 
the company believes that the relatively moderate rate of inflation over the past several years has not had a significant impact on its sales or profitability  but can give no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
impact of accounting statements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is required to be adopted for years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating sfas and has not yet determined its impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
year compliance many of the company s computer systems and software products  as well as the systems and products of third parties doing business with the company  are subject to the year issue  which is the inability of a computer to correctly process dates after december  this inability could potentially cause affected computers to shut down or perform incorrect calculations  ultimately resulting in a system failure  disruption of operations  and the inability to engage in normal business activities 
this issue also affects products or system which contain embedded computer chips with date sensitive programming such as security systems  telephone equipment and office equipment 
as a result  many companies software and computer systems need to be upgraded or replaced in order to address the year issue 
see safe harbor statement on page the company has implemented a program to evaluate and address the risks and problems associated with the year issue 
this program identifies four stages as follows the preliminary assessment of each computer system and microprocessor the company utilizes for year compliance is complete  and the testing of these systems and microprocessors is approximately complete 
as a result of this assessment  the company believes most of the significant systems and microprocessors it utilizes are currently year compliant or will be with the installation of available upgrades  except for an accounting system used by two of the company s subsidiaries 
the identification of year compliance by significant or critical third parties has been completed  and the scheduled completion date to replace all non compliant third parties is october the completion of any company system conversions and verification that all company systems are year compliant are expected to be completed by december the development of a contingency plan is the last phase and is expected to be completed by october the company currently expects its contingency plan to include installation of certain year compliant software  currently in use at most of its operations  for the two subsidiaries with non compliant accounting software 
the costs incurred to date to address the year issue have not been material  however  the company expects to incur between  and  as an expense  in addition to approximately  of capital expenditures  during in order to complete the assessment and implementation  and to fund such cost from operations 
this anticipated cost is required to replace non compliant microprocessors and to purchase and implement accounting software for two of the company s subsidiaries 
these activities are being performed in conjunction with a larger multi year migration from the company s current systems to an enterprise wide management information system 
this estimate assumes that third parties have correctly assessed and communicated to the company the status of their year compliance  and that material year compliance issues with respect to third parties who have not communicated with the company will not arise in the future 
because of this reliance and the subjective nature of the year compliance issue  the actual costs to address and resolve any non compliance issues may differ materially from those anticipated 
the company could be affected if the year issue affects suppliers abilities to provide raw materials needed in the manufacturing process 
the company is also dependent on third parties or government agencies to supply sufficient electrical power  utilities  transportation and other services to sustain the manufacturing process and cac s operations  process  pay and maintain records of certain employee benefits  supply funds in a timely fashion for its dealers and retail customers to purchase homes  and fund sales of portions of cac s loan portfolio 
any failure on the part of these third parties could have a material adverse effect on the business operations and financial performance of the company 
if the company s efforts to resolve the year issue are not adequate or implemented in a timely manner  the company could experience a disruption in its normal business activities 
management of the company believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be the delay in collections from third party financing agents which could result in liquidity issues for the company  as well as the delay of financial reporting due to any accounting processes which may need to be performed manually until all year issues are resolved 
however  the potential consequences of the year issue are inherently uncertain  and consequently  no assurance can be given that this will be the reasonably likely worst case scenario 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk inherent in its financial instruments 
the company is not currently subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
the company is exposed to market risk related to investments held in a non qualified trust used to fund benefits under its deferred compensation plan 
these investments totaled million at december  due to the long term nature of the benefit liabilities that these assets fund  the company s exposure to market risk is low 
a decline in market value of these investments would not result in a material near term funding of the trust or exposure to the benefit liabilities funded 
the company purchases retail installment contracts from its exclusive dealers  at fixed interest rates  in the ordinary course of business  and periodically resells certain of these loans to a financial institution under the terms of the retail finance agreement discussed above 
the periodic resale of installment contracts reduces the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations  as the majority of contracts are held for a short period of time 
additionally  the company has installment loans receivable in its portfolio of million which may be sold during the company s portfolio consists of fixed rate contracts with interest rates generally ranging from to and an average original term of months at december  the company estimated the fair value of its installment contracts receivable using discounted cash flows and interest rates offered by cac on similar contracts at december  see safe harbor statement on page the company has notes payable under retail floor plan agreements and an industrial development revenue bond issue that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
although these borrowings are floating rate debt  the interest rate risk posed by these borrowings currently is low because the amount of debt has historically been small in relation to annual cash flow 
the company has the ability to retire this debt if interest rates were to increase significantly 
additionally  the company has two industrial development revenue bond issues at fixed interest rates 
the estimated fair value of outstanding borrowings approximated carrying value at december  the company estimated the fair value of its debt instruments using rates at which the company believes it could have obtained similar borrowings at that time 
the company also has the ability to incur debt under its credit facility which provides for interest at the bank s prime rate for the revolving and warehouse line of credit and at fixed rates for a certain period of time for the term notes 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates at december  assumed annual principal cash flows dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value installment loan portfolio       weighted average interest rate expected principal maturity dates thereafter total fair value notes payable and long term debt     weighted average interest rate
