during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company adopted a formal plan to discontinue the silica sorting and grinding business 
as of october  the board of directors determined it was in the best interest of the company to alter its plan for disposing of the discontinued silica operations 
under the revised plan  the company decided to liquidate the silica plant assets rather than sell the entire operation as a unit 
accordingly  the silica plant business was reported as a discontinued operation for fiscal charges in fiscal were for costs in excess of the provision for estimated loss on disposal and discontinued operation  which was previously recorded 
during fiscal  the liquidation of the silica plant assets was completed 
no gain or loss was recognized on the sale in fiscal since the silica plant assets were previously written down to reflect this sale

for fiscal  the company had a net loss of  and net cash used in operating activities of  since the company has sold most of its cherry creek real estate properties  revenues from the sale of real estate in the near future are not expected to be sufficient to fund the company s operations 
in the past  the company had received most of its revenue from the sale of real estate  but it does not expect real estate sales to be as significant in future periods 
the company has recently entered into water sale transactions that are expected to generate water revenues  and is attempting to complete other similar transactions 
however  while revenues from existing water sales contracts  leasing the company s rice farms and ranches  from the cucamonga fee agreement  and cash received from principal and interest payments on promissory notes held by the company will be more predictable than periodic income received on historic sales of real estate assets  such recurring revenues will be insufficient for some time into the future to cover general and administrative expenses  interest on outstanding indebtedness and dividends declared on its outstanding preferred stock 
revenue from water operations will continue to be dependent on individually negotiated transactions and revenues  if any  derived from the company s long term water development projects 
based on the company s current estimates  the company expects that revenues from planned water sales and from its existing long term water development projects will continue to be insufficient to fund the company s working capital needs during the current fiscal year 
accordingly  the company s future operations will be funded primarily from the company s existing financial resources  from financing it may arrange using debt or equity and from proceeds the company may derive from such future water sale transactions that the company may from time to time consummate

the index price is the sum of the price established by the mwd for full service untreated water and the price components established by the west basin municipal water district for the mwd readiness to serve charge and the west basin surcharge for basic non interruptible water 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund the company s foreseeable working capital needs for a period of at least one year from the date of this report

the company formed a project team to identify year impacts  resolve year problems and implement compliance plans

most of the company s vendors have confirmed that they already are or will be year compliant 
in addition  the company receives payments from a variety of external sources 
although the company has made reasonable efforts to identify and protect itself with respect to external year problems  there can be no assurance that the company will not be affected by such problems

risk factors the company s business and operations involve numerous risks  some of which are beyond the company s control  that may affect future results and the market price of the company s common stock 
the following discussion highlights some of the risks the company faces 
uneven patterns of quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
these quarterly fluctuations are the result of a number of factors  including the company s dependence on isolated sales of real estate as its principal source of revenues and the sporadic revenues generated to date from the company s water related activities 
until the company enters into agreements for the long term sale lease of water  the company s revenues will continue to be dependent upon periodic and isolated sales of water and or real estate 
the variations in the company s quarterly results is one of the factors that may contribute to fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
limited history of operations in principal business 
to date  the company s activities have primarily consisted of i acquiring its various water rights and related assets  ii raising capital to fund both the cost of such acquisitions and its working capital needs  and iii developing its water rights 
although the company operates in two operating segments the acquisition and development of water rights and the sale of water  and the sale of real estate interests acquired in connection with the acquisition of water rights  the company anticipates that a majority of its revenues in the future will be derived from its water rights activities 
however  the company only generated   and  of revenue from its water rights activities during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
accordingly  the company does not have an established record of water sales transactions 
to date  the company s general and administrative and interest expenses have exceeded its on going revenue from its water and water rights development and disposition business  and the majority of its operating revenue have been derived from the sale of the company s real estate assets 
no assurance can be given that the company will continue to be able to successfully develop  package and sell water 
uncertainty of future water revenue 
the company s long term future profitability is primarily dependent on i the company s ability to sell significant quantities of water from its northern california water assets  ii the company s ability to develop and sell water as part of the cherry creek project  iii the company s activities as an independent water provider in southern california  iv the company s ability to resolve issues regarding the transportation of water to the customer  and v the company s ability to develop and sell new sources of water at a profit 
until may  the company s plan was to permit the yuba county water agency to integrate the company s yuba property water into the water agency s conjunctive use plans for developing and marketing water to third parties 
the company s agreement with the yuba county water agency regarding the joint development and marketing of water expired in may the company is currently evaluating various alternative plans to commercially exploit its yuba property water rights  but has not yet entered into any agreements to sell its yuba property water 
although the company has received the approval of its plan of augmentation from the colorado water court  to date  the company has not consummated any water sales in the cherry creek area and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to do so in the future 
the company s ability to become an independent water provider in southern california is dependent upon the company acquiring groundwater rights and other water assets  its ability to arrange for the transportation and storage of water  its success in obtaining all necessary governmental and regulatory consents and approvals  and on its ability to finance the foregoing activities 
the water transfer business is a new and developing business in southern california  and the market for such water transfers is still developing 
accordingly  the company expects to encounter problems in developing a market for water transfers and the nature of these problems  and timing  is not known at this time 
as a result  it is uncertain when  or if  the company will generate revenues from its new water transfer activities
