quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposure to market risk is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its credit facility as interest on the credit facility is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the amount outstanding under the credit facility represents approximately of debt outstanding as of december  the company also utilizes mortgage debt with fixed rates as a source of capital 
the weighted average maturity for fixed rate debt was years at december  as these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
if the interest rate for the credit facility was basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have been increased or decreased by approximately  none of the company s fixed rate debt matures in the company currently does not intend to refinance any of its fixed rate debt in this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
