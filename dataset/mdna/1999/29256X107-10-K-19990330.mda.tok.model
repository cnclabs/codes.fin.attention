in addition  synthelabo paid million annually in research payments for two years and paid  for the third year 
during  tbc signed agreements with synthelabo to provide copies of certain novastan r clinical data 
over the life of the agreements tbc may receive as much as million  of which million has been received as of december  during october  the company executed a research and common stock purchase agreement with lg chemical 
lg chemical purchased  shares of common stock for million and committed to pay up to million over a five year period to develop two compounds in clinical development 
of this amount  million has been paid and million will be paid on each of june and december  of and  and million will be paid on june and december  in august  the company entered into the smithkline agreement whereby smithkline was granted exclusive rights to work with tbc in the development and commercialization of novastan r in the us and canada for specified indications 
upon execution of the agreement  smithkline paid an million license fee and during october  paid a million milestone payment to tbc and has committed to pay up to a total of million in additional milestone payments based on the clinical development and fda approval of novastan r for the indications of hit  hitts and ami 
future milestone payments for the ami indication are subject to smithkline s agreement to market novastan r for such indication 
in connection with the smithkline agreement  smithkline purchased  shares of common stock for million and an additional  shares of common stock for million in conjunction with the company s public offering which closed during october  at this time  smithkline has no plans to conduct development work for the ami and stroke indications 
tbc is evaluating the feasibility of development of novastan r for stroke and possibly ami 
the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly during each quarter  and the company anticipates that such fluctuations  largely attributable to varying research and development commitments and expenditures  will continue for the next several years 
results of operations revenues were   and  during  and  respectively 
for the years and  respectively  revenues included  and  of product sales from the company s subsidiary ipi 
for the years  and  revenues also included   and  from research agreements  commercialization agreements and collaborations with various other companies 
revenues from research agreements in includes research payments from lg chemical  in includes research payments from lg chemical  a license fee of  and a milestone payment of  and in includes million in research payments from synthelabo and million for data supplied to synthelabo 
interest income was   and  for the years  and  respectively 
interest income for the year was significantly higher over and due to investment of funds received in conjunction with the smithkline agreement and a secondary public offering of common stock completed in october research and development expenses decreased from  in to  in and decreased from  in to  in the decrease from to was due primarily to reduced spending for clinical trials for novastan r that were completed in and one time charges during associated with the license of novastan r 
the decrease from to was primarily due to the decrease in expenses related to the clinical trials of novastan r 
non cash charges for the purchase of in process research and development decreased from  in to  in because of common stock issued pursuant to the novastan r license agreement and a research collaboration agreement signed in  respectively 
in the company charged  to expense for costs related to restructuring ipi 
general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in and increased from  in to  in the decrease in from and increase in over was primarily because of a  noncash charge related to the extension of the exercise period for certain stock options and an increase in legal fees related to patent applications for tbc s compounds 
rent and related building services  which is a component of both research and development and general and administrative expense  was approximately  in   in and  in the decrease of approximately  in from was primarily due to the consolidation of ipi into tbc and the termination of the lease for the ipi facility 
the company incurred net losses applicable to common shares of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the company has financed its research and development activities to date principally through i public offerings and private placements of its equity securities  ii issuances of common stock in conjunction with acquisitions and research and collaboration agreements and exercises of stock options and warrants  iii license fees and milestone and research payments received in conjunction with research and collaborative agreements  and iv investment income  net of interest expense 
during  the company utilized net cash of  in operating activities 
the use of cash in operations was caused primarily by the company s net loss 
investing and financing activities primarily reflect the utilization of  in net proceeds from the private placement of the preferred stock and  in net proceeds from the secondary public offering of common stock  net of purchases and redemptions of short term investments during in addition   was provided by exercise of warrants and stock options 
at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments of the company expects to incur substantial research and development expenditures as it designs and develops small molecule drugs for vascular diseases 
the company anticipates that operating expenses may increase during and subsequent years 
the company began to incur costs to develop novastan r during the third quarter of these costs will continue during due to expenses associated with the amendment of the new drug application with the fda for novastan r and costs associated with additional clinical and regulatory work being completed for novastan r 
the company also began incurring clinical trial costs in for the compounds tbc and tbc and is continuing its clinical trials for these compounds during in  the company expects to begin to incur costs for clinical trials related to additional compounds 
these costs include  among other things  hiring personnel to direct and carry out all operations related to the clinical trials  hospital and procedural costs  services of a contract research organization and purchasing and formulating large quantities of the compound to be used in such trials 
in addition  the company anticipates that the administrative costs associated with this effort will be significant 
the amounts and timing of expenditures will depend on the progress of the company s ongoing research  clinical development and commercialization efforts 
the company anticipates that its existing capital resources  research payments from lg chemical and its other revenue sources should be sufficient to fund its cash requirements through the second quarter of the year this date is contingent upon various factors  including the rates of patient enrollment and spending associated with the development and commercialization of novastan r  the level of research  development and clinical trial expenditures for tbc  tbc and other compounds  results of clinical trials  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals including novastan r  the success of sales and marketing efforts for novastan r  if approved by the fda  the exercise of the company s publicly traded warrants  if any  which expire on september  and are presently not in the money  and the timing and terms of future corporate collaborations  if any  entered into by the company 
if the company does not receive timely fda approval for novastan r  or such approval is significantly delayed or if novastan r cannot be successfully marketed after fda approval  the company will need to re examine the use of its existing capital resources 
no assurances can be given that the company will be able to continue its research and development programs at currently anticipated levels 
moreover  tbc s agreement with synthelabo requires the company to maintain a net worth  as defined in the agreement  of at least million during the term of the agreement 
if the company fails to maintain at least million of net worth  synthelabo may require that the technology  as defined in the agreement  be transferred to  and the development program be conducted by  a joint venture owned by tbc and synthelabo 
the outcome of certain lawsuits that have been filed against the company could also have an impact on liquidity 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
the company anticipates that it may need to raise substantial funds for future operations through collaborative arrangements  public or private issuance of debt and equity  or other arrangements 
these financings could result in the issuance of equity securities which dilute the existing holders of the company s common stock 
the company expects that as additional product candidates enter clinical trials  the company may incur increased expenditures for laboratory space  scientific and administrative personnel  and services of contract research organizations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such additional financings or establish corporate collaborations on acceptable terms or in time to fund its research and development programs 
it is likely that the company s ability to raise additional funds will be adversely affected by unfavorable results of its clinical trials and the failure to obtain regulatory approvals for its product candidates  including novastan r 
in the event such financing is not obtained  the company s drug discovery or development programs may be delayed  scaled back or eliminated 
the company may also be required in this event to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require the company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies  product candidates or products that it would not otherwise relinquish 
impact of inflation and changing prices the pharmaceutical research industry is labor intensive  and wages and related expenses increase in inflationary periods 
the lease of space and related building services for the houston facility contains a clause that escalates rent and related services each year based on the increase in building operating costs and the increase in the houston consumer price index  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on the operations of the company 
year issue the year yk issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
computer equipment  software and other devices with imbedded technology that are time sensitive  such as computer systems  related software  research equipment  alarm systems and telephone systems may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  temporary inability to process data  and may materially impact the company s financial condition 
the company has undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that it is prepared for the yk issue 
the company is in the process of assessing its state of readiness 
presently  the company has reviewed its scientific equipment  computer systems and related software to identify systems which may exhibit yk issues 
this review was performed by internal teams from various disciplines within the company 
these teams evaluated the company s equipment  computer systems and software for yk issues and is currently performing testing to insure proper operation after january  if necessary  specific remediation plans will be developed for non compliant items after testing is completed 
as a part of this review the company will determine the known risks related to the consequences of a failure to correct any yk deficiencies 
the company has initiated formal communications with material third parties to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their yk problems 
the company and its licensee  smithkline beecham plc are dependent upon mitsubishi chemical corporation for supply of bulk novastan r for clinical trial material and for its inventory needs should the fda approve the compound for marketing 
the company has received communication from mitsubishi chemical corporation which states that it has undertaken to become yk compliant 
any yk issues which would result in significant interruptions of delivery schedules could have a material effect on the company s operations 
however  the company is presently not aware of any yk issues that have been encountered by any third party  which could materially affect the company s operations 
the company has developed a contingency plan to address potential yk issues 
this contingency plan addresses problems that the company may encounter after january  and will be updated to include issues identified during the course of its remediation efforts and reasonably foreseeable problems that may arise as a result of yk  including  but not limited to computer hardware and software and research equipment 
the contingency plan will be continually refined as additional information becomes available 
however  it is unlikely that any contingency plan can fully address all events that may arise 
the company estimates that the costs associated with the yk issue will not be material  and as such will not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or operating results 
the company s current estimate of yk remediation costs is approximately  which may be revised should other remediation costs be discovered in the review of yk issues 
however  the failure to discover or correct a material yk problem could result in an interruption in the company s normal business activities or operations 
such failure could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operation  liquidity and financial condition
