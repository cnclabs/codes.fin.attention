item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the purpose of this section is to give interpretive guidance to the reader of the financial statements 
for specific policies and breakdowns  refer to the consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of the company s expectations regarding future trends affecting its business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of overview systems computer technology corporation the company develops  licenses  and supports a suite of client server  enterprise software and provides a range of information technology outsourcing services 
in addition  the company offers a series of related services including systems implementation  systems integration  and maintenance and enhancements 
the company s markets are higher education  government  process manufacturing and distribution  and energy and utilities 
the company s focus on four vertical markets enables it to develop and utilize a base of industry expertise to deliver products and services that address specific client requirements 
the company licenses software under license agreements and provides support services including training  installation  consulting  and maintenance and enhancements 
maintenance and enhancement agreements provide for telephone support and error correction for current versions of licensed systems  as well as regulatory updates and functional and technical enhancements to licensed systems if and when they become generally available 
the company derives services revenues from a variety of professional services  which include information systems planning  implementation  integration  and customization services for client systems 
these services contracts are typically longer in term than software support services and shorter in term than information technology outsourcing services 
the company provides information technology outsourcing services  which are comprised of a range of information technology areas including end user computing solutions  network management  applications outsourcing  and business process outsourcing 
these services are designed to assume total or partial control and responsibility for clients information resources  generally on a long term basis 
the company provides management  staffing  and support with skilled information systems personnel and industry specialists who are knowledgeable in both computer based technologies and the functional aspects of clients activities 
results of operations the following table sets forth i income statement items as a percentage of total revenue and ii the percentage change for each item from the prior year comparative period 
of total revenue change from year ended september  prior year revenues outsourcing services software sales maintenance and enhancements software services other  primarily interest total expenses cost of services  software sales  and maintenance and enhancements selling  general  and administrative charge for purchased research and development interest expense income before income taxes for the year ended september   selling  general  and administrative expense includes equity in losses of affiliate of million or of total revenues 
the following table sets forth the gross profit for each of the following revenue categories as a percentage of revenue for each such category and the total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue excluding other revenue 
the company does not separately present the cost of maintenance and enhancements revenue as it is impracticable to separate such cost from the cost of software sales 
year ended september  gross profit outsourcing services software sales and maintenance and enhancements software services total revenues the and increases in outsourcing services revenue in fiscal years and  respectively  are primarily the result of i increases in outsourcing services provided to a number of existing significant clients and ii full period effects of contracts signed throughout fiscal years and contract renewal rates  as a percentage of annual revenue from contracts available for renewal  for the fiscal years   and were   and  respectively 
contracts available for renewal in a particular period include contracts with expiration dates within the period  as well as contracts renewed during the period that have expiration dates in a later period 
software sales decreased in the year ended september  compared to the prior year period due primarily to decreased licenses of banner customer information system cis software in the energy and utilities market and adage enterprise resource planning erp software to the process manufacturing and distribution market 
also contributing to the decrease were decreases in licenses of banner software in the domestic higher education marketplace 
the decreases in fiscal year were offset by increased licenses in the international utility and education markets 
software sales increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year due primarily to increased licenses of banner cis software to the energy and utilities market and increased banner software licenses to the higher education market 
the company experienced a slight increase in license fee revenue in fiscal year versus fiscal year in its adage erp software 
the and increases in maintenance and enhancements revenue in fiscal years and  respectively  were the result of the growing installed base of clients in the higher education  energy and utilities  and process manufacturing and distribution marketplaces 
the company continues to experience a high annual renewal rate on existing maintenance contracts in these marketplaces  although there can be no assurances that this will continue 
software services revenue increased and in fiscal years and  respectively  compared to the prior year periods primarily as the result of increases in implementation and integration services in the energy and utilities  higher education  and process manufacturing and distribution markets 
the increases in fiscal year were offset by decreases  compared to the prior year period  in services provided to the international utilities market 
the fluctuations in other revenue in fiscal years and are primarily attributable to fluctuations in interest revenue earned on the company s cash and short term investments balances 
interest revenue increased in fiscal year due to the increased cash and short term investments balances during the year resulting from a debt issuance in october cash and short term investments balances were lower during fiscal year primarily as a result of the acquisition of fygir logistic information systems  bv in september and the purchase of million in treasury stock in the first six months of fiscal year gross profit gross profit decreased as a percentage of total revenue excluding other revenue from for fiscal year to for fiscal year the total gross profit percentage decreased primarily because of a decrease in the software sales and maintenance and enhancements gross profit  which makes up the greatest percentage of the company s total gross profit 
this decrease was primarily the result of increases in non capitalized product development expenditures combined with decreased software licenses  primarily in the process manufacturing and distribution and energy and utilities markets  and to a lesser extent  in the higher education market 
the decrease in the software sales and maintenance and enhancements gross profit was partially offset by an increase in the gross profit of outsourcing services as a result of cost savings in fiscal year  and an increase in the software services gross profit as a result of improved productivity and increased implementation and integration services performed during fiscal year in the energy and utilities and process manufacturing and distribution markets 
the company is continuing to focus on software services in each of its markets 
since services margins have historically been lower than the margins derived from software sales and maintenance and enhancements  an increase in services revenue as a percentage of total revenue historically has resulted in a lower overall profit margin 
gross profit decreased as a percentage of total revenue excluding other revenue from to for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year the total gross profit percentage decreased primarily because of a decrease in the software sales and maintenance and enhancements gross profit  which makes up the greatest percentage of the company s total gross profit 
this decrease was primarily the result of an increase in non capitalized product development expenditures  principally in the process manufacturing and distribution market  at a rate greater than the revenue rate increase 
the outsourcing services gross profit increased in fiscal year versus fiscal year as a result of higher margins on new contract signings compared with older contracts 
the software services margin increased primarily as a result of increased profitability in energy and utilities and process manufacturing and distribution services  although margins continued to be impacted by unprofitable international operations 
acquisitions in august  the company acquired rsmart learning systems corporation 
the company intends to embed rsmart functions into its sct aspire distributed learning software and integrate this functionality with other higher education applications 
the purchase price was paid with approximately  shares of the company s common stock valued at million 
the company recorded goodwill of 
million related to the acquisition 
in may  the company acquired advanced planning systems  inc  which offers a demand planning product to the process manufacturing and distribution market  for total consideration of million comprised of approximately  shares of the company s common stock valued at million and 
million cash 
the company recorded goodwill of million related to the acquisition 
in september  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of fygir logistic information systems  bv fygir 
fygir is a leading provider of supply chain planning software to the process manufacturing and distribution market 
the total cost of the acquisition was million 
in conjunction with the acquisition  which was accounted for as a purchase  the company recorded a charge to operations of million for in process research and development at the time of the acquisition 
included in this amount were the fair values of fygir products under development that had not reached technological feasibility at the time of the acquisition 
the in process technology acquired in the fygir acquisition consisted of multiple significant research and development projects  most of which the company continues to develop 
the company believes that these projects  which can be separated into three categories significant new features  new technology  and tightly integrated will all contribute to future generations of the company s software 
at the time of the fygir acquisition  the company assigned a value of million to the fygir in process technology with the assistance of an independent valuation 
significant new features projects represent significant improvements to existing core technology acquired that could result in price and sales increases 
new technology projects are associated with the design of the next generation fygir products 
tightly integrated projects are related to integrating fygir developed technology with the company s technology 
the company estimates that the significant new features  new technology  and tightly integrated projects were in the aggregate approximately   and complete  respectively  as of the date of acquisition 
at the time of the fygir valuation  the company made projections regarding future revenues and investment for the fygir solution 
although fiscal year sales and research and development expenditures were lower than anticipated  the company maintains its original total revenue and investment projections 
the anticipated remaining development project expenses are approximately million 
the nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all planning  designing  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or service can be produced to meet its design requirements  including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
future developments in the supply chain management industry  changes in other product and service offerings  or other developments may cause the company to alter or abandon these plans 
investment in campus pipeline  inc throughout  the company made a series of investments in campus pipeline  inc  and  as of september   held an approximately interest in the common stock of this affiliate  valued at million 
the company has determined that its control of campus pipeline is temporary  and therefore has accounted for its investment using the equity method of accounting 
there are convertible preferred shares outstanding that  if converted  would lower the company s interest to less than 
campus pipeline is expected to integrate the internet with the company s higher education information systems  which provides hour access to campus and internet resources and allows students to enroll  register for classes  view grades  request transcripts and loan status  obtain reading lists  buy books  access e mail  and participate in interactive chat sessions with their professors 
the company s proportionate share of the affiliate s losses for the year ended september  was million 
the company expects that its investment will be reduced to zero in fiscal year as the company continues to record its proportionate share of losses of the affiliate 
income taxes the fiscal year provision for income taxes does not reflect the customary relationship between income before income taxes and tax expense principally due to not recording a tax benefit for losses related to the company s foreign operations 
increased research and development expenditures in fiscal year resulted in an increased research and development tax credit  which expired june  the provision for income taxes for the year ended september  does not reflect the customary relationship between income before income taxes and tax expense principally due to the write off of purchased research and development  which is not deductible for state income tax purposes 
the rate was further affected by the expiration of the research and development tax credit as of june  subsequent to the fiscal year end  the research and development tax credit was reinstated 
at september   the company has million net operating loss carryforwards in various states and million of net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the state carryforwards expire in various periods ending on or before september  the foreign tax losses can be indefinitely carried forward 
at september  and  the company has valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  with respect to the deferred tax assets related to the state and foreign carryforwards 
the company s foreign subsidiaries must generate approximately million in pretax earnings in order to realize the related net deferred tax asset 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations of its foreign subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the company s net deferred tax assets 
cyclical nature of business certain non seasonal factors have resulted in quarterly fluctuations in operating results  including variability of software license fee revenues  seasonal patterns of capital spending by clients  the timing and receipt of orders  competition  pricing  new product introductions by the company or its competitors  levels of market acceptance for new products  year issues  and general economic and political conditions 
while the company has historically generated a greater portion of license fees in total revenue in the last two fiscal quarters  the non seasonal factors cited above may have a greater effect than seasonality on the company s results of operations 
liquidity  capital resources  and financial position the company s cash and cash equivalents balance was million and million at september  and  respectively 
the short term investments balance decreased to million at september  from million at september  cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year operating cash flows have decreased as the result of decreases in income before charges for purchased research and development and depreciation and amortization in the year ended september  and increases in accounts receivable and other current assets balances 
the increases in accounts receivable balances at september  compared to september  are primarily the result of the timing of billings on software licenses and increased revenues 
the increase in other current assets is primarily the result of increases in prepaid tax balances 
the company provides outsourcing services and software related services  including systems implementation and integration services 
contract fees from outsourcing services are typically based on multi year contracts ranging from three to years in length  and provide a recurring revenue stream throughout the term of the contract 
software services contracts  including systems implementation and integration services  usually have shorter terms than outsourcing services contracts  and billings are sometimes milestone based 
during the beginning of a typical outsourcing services contract  services are performed and expenses are incurred by the company at a greater rate than in the later part of the contract 
billings usually remain constant during the term of the contract and  in some cases  when a contract term is extended  the billing period is also extended over the new life of the contract 
in certain systems integration contracts  services are performed by the company but cannot be billed until a milestone is attained 
revenue is usually recognized as work is performed 
the resulting excess of revenues over billings is reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet as unbilled accounts receivable 
as an outsourcing services contract proceeds  services are performed and expenses are incurred at a lesser rate  resulting in billings exceeding revenue recognized  which causes a decrease in the unbilled accounts receivable  as will the achievement of a milestone in a systems integration services contract  although additional unbilled accounts receivable will continue to build based on the terms of the contracts 
the remaining unbilled accounts receivable balance is comprised of software sales for which product has been shipped and revenue has been recognized but amounts have not been billed due to the contractual payment terms established 
these unbilled balances are generally billed within one year 
the company s working capital at september  was million and at september  was million 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal year compared with cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal year the company s net proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale investments of million were offset by purchases of property and equipment and the investment in campus pipeline described above 
the company incurred fit up and remodeling costs for two buildings on and near its malvern campus and construction and fit up costs for a new building adjacent to the company s existing building in columbia  sc 
the company s primary use of cash for investing activities in fiscal year was the purchase of available for sale investments from the proceeds of the bond offering during the first quarter of fiscal year and the aforementioned cash acquisition of fygir 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year net proceeds from borrowings were offset by principal payments on short term debt and consist primarily of activity in the company s revolving credit facility 
the primary use of cash in financing activities was the purchase of million in treasury stock 
during fiscal year  cash provided by financing activities of million was primarily the result of the net proceeds of the bond offering 
the company has a million senior revolving credit facility available for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility agreement expires in june with optional annual renewals 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at september  or as long as borrowings are outstanding  and as a condition precedent to new borrowings  the company must comply with certain covenants established in the agreement 
under the covenants  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions 
the company may not pay dividends other than dividends payable in common stock or acquire any of its capital stock outstanding without a written waiver from its lender 
in october  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of its common shares 
the company repurchased million of its common shares for million 
the company s senior revolving credit agreement covenants were amended in october to allow the company to repurchase capital stock not to exceed million and million shares before april  the company is unable to repurchase additional shares of common stock without another amendment to its credit agreement 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  short term investments  and borrowing arrangements should satisfy its financing needs for the foreseeable future 
on april   the company s board of directors authorized a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend distributed on may  to shareholders of record on may  stockholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock split for all periods presented by reclassifying from capital in excess of par value to common stock the par value of the additional shares arising from the split 
in addition  all references in the financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to number of shares and per share amounts have been restated 
on april   the company called for redemption its outstanding convertible subordinated debentures due september  the redemption date was may  during fiscal year  million shares were issued related to the conversion of all but  of the remaining convertible subordinated debentures  of which million shares were issued on the redemption date 
had these converted shares been outstanding for the full year ended september   net income per common share for the year ended september  would have decreased by 
to 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share sfas  was effective for periods ending after december  as a result  the company changed the method used to compute income per share and restated all prior periods presented 
under the requirements of sfas  net income per common share excludes the dilutive effect of both stock options and convertible debentures  and net income per share assuming dilution must include the dilutive effect of both stock options and convertible debentures even if the dilutive effect is immaterial 
financial risk management the company invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments  including state and municipal securities  corporate debt securities  and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
historically  the company s investment income has not been material to the company s financial results  and the company does not expect that changes in interest rates will have a material impact on the results of operations 
see note b to the financial statements for additional information with respect to the investment portfolio 
the company also has issued fixed rate debt  which is convertible to company stock at a pre determined conversion price 
convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interest rate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interest rate environment and the price of the underlying company stock 
for the year ended september   the company s convertible debt  on an if converted basis  was not dilutive and  as a result  had no impact on the company s net income per share assuming dilution 
in future periods  the debt may be converted  or the if converted method may be dilutive and net income per share assuming dilution would be reduced 
see note f to the financial statements for additional information with respect to the company s long term debt 
although the company conducts business internationally  most of its contracts are denominated in the us dollar 
the company s primary international subsidiary s functional currency is the british pound 
foreign currency exposure is limited  as most financial assets and liabilities denominated in the foreign currency are short term in nature 
contingencies on november   the court approved the settlement of the class action lawsuit filed on october   by john j 
wallace in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against the company  michael j 
emmi  chairman of the board  president  and chief executive officer of the company  michael d 
chamberlain  senior vice president and a director of the company  and eric haskell  senior vice president  finance administration  treasurer  and chief financial officer of the company alleging violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws 
under the terms of the settlement  the company paid  new accounting standards on october   the company adopted statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
in december  acsec issued statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
sop introduces a framework whereby revenue would be recognized for each element in a software licensing arrangement when certain criteria are met 
sop requires license fees to be allocated to the separate elements of multiple element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and provides guidance on postcontract customer support arrangements 
sop  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after march   requires recognition of revenue on undelivered elements of a contract using the residual method  as defined in sop the adoption of sop did not  and the adoption of sop is not expected to  have a significant impact on the results of operations 
however  the accounting profession continues to review certain provisions of sop  with the objective of providing additional guidance on implementing its provisions 
depending upon the outcome of these reviews and the issuance of implementation guidelines and interpretations  the company may be required to change its revenue recognition policies and business practices  and such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and or financial condition 
on october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no  reporting comprehensive income sfas 
sfas requires disclosure of the components of total non stockholder changes in equity as comprehensive income 
this includes foreign currency translation gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities that have been previously excluded from net income and reflected instead in stockholders equity 
factors that may affect future results and market price of stock the matters discussed herein and elsewhere that are forward looking statements  including statements concerning the company s or management s forecasts  estimates  intentions  beliefs  anticipations  plans  expectations  or predictions for the future  are based on current management expectations that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the following discussion highlights some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and or financial condition 
the company s revenues and operating results can vary substantially from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors 
software sales revenues in any quarter are dependent on the execution of license agreements and shipment of product 
the execution of license agreements is difficult to predict for a variety of reasons including the following a significant portion of the company s license agreements are typically signed in the last month of each quarter  the duration of the company s sales cycle is relatively long  the size of transactions can vary widely  client projects may be postponed or cancelled due to changes in the client s management  budgetary constraints  or strategic priorities  and clients often exhibit a seasonal pattern of capital spending 
the company has historically generated a greater portion of license fees in total revenue in the last two fiscal quarters  although there is no assurance that this will continue 
many potential clients are now focusing their efforts on remediating existing systems or implementing new systems to solve year issues 
while the company believes that such evaluations favorably impacted demand for its software products and services in fiscal years and  such demand has diminished in fiscal year since services to remediate year issues must be completed in a timely manner and lead times required to complete systems implementations now preclude system replacement as a timely solution to the year issue 
given the lack of precedent for an issue of this magnitude  the company s ability to accurately forecast the impact of the year issue on quarter to quarter revenue achievement is limited 
customers have been slowing down computer software purchases as they devote more time to preparing the testing of their systems for year readiness  rather than evaluating and implementing new systems 
it is difficult to predict when customer software purchases will return to normal levels 
since a significant part of the company s business results from software licensing  the company s business is characterized by a high degree of operating leverage 
the company s expense levels are based  in significant part  on the company s expectations as to future revenues and are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
if software licensing revenues do not meet expectations  net income is likely to be disproportionately adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or even maintain its current level of profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
it is therefore possible that in one or more future quarters the company s operating results will be below expectations 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be adversely affected 
the success of the company s business is dependent upon certain key management  sales  and technical personnel 
in addition  the company believes that to succeed in the future it will be necessary to continue to attract  retain  and motivate additional talented and qualified management  sales  and technical personnel 
competition for hiring such personnel in the information technology industry is intense and demand for such employees has  to date  exceeded supply 
the company from time to time experiences difficulty in locating candidates with appropriate qualifications 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its key employees or that it will be able to continue to attract  assimilate  and retain other skilled management  sales  and technical personnel 
the loss of certain of its existing key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and or financial condition 
the application software industry is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements  product introductions  and evolving industry standards 
the company believes that its future success will depend on its ability to compete successfully and to continue to develop and market new products and enhancements cost effectively  which will necessitate continued investment in research and development and sales and marketing 
there can be no assurance that the company s existing products will not be rendered obsolete or non competitive by new industry standards or changing technology  that the company will be able to develop and market new products successfully  or that the company s new product offerings will be accepted by its markets 
furthermore  programs as complex as those offered by the company may contain undetected errors or bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and by third party test sites  errors will not be found in new product offerings  with the possible result of unanticipated costs and delays in market acceptance of these products 
in addition  new distribution methods  like electronic channels and opportunities presented by the internet and electronic commerce  have removed many of the barriers to entry historically faced by small and start up companies in the software industry 
the company expects to face increasing competition in the various markets in which it competes 
the company has invested in and entered into a strategic alliance with campus pipeline 
the company expects to integrate its higher education information systems with the campus pipeline product to provide hour access to campus and internet resources and allow students to enroll  register for classes  view grades  request transcripts and loan status  obtain reading lists  buy books  access e mail and participate in interactive chat sessions 
while some of these features have been included in a product which has been released by campus pipeline  other features are scheduled for future releases 
the success of this investment and alliance is dependent upon the ability of campus pipeline to meet development and implementation schedules for the product and enhance the product over time  the market acceptance of the campus pipeline product  and the company s ability to integrate the campus pipeline product with the company s products cost effectively and on a timely basis 
certain of the company s contracts are subject to fiscal funding clauses  which provide that in the event of budgetary constraints  the client is entitled to reduce the level of services to be provided by the company with a corresponding reduction in the fee to be paid by the client  or  in certain circumstances  to terminate the services altogether 
while the company has not been impacted materially by early terminations or reductions in service from the use of fiscal funding provisions in the past  there can be no assurance that such provisions will not give rise to early terminations or reductions of service in the future 
if clients of the company representing a substantial portion of the company s revenues were to invoke the fiscal funding provisions of their outsourcing services contracts  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company provides software related services  including systems implementation and integration services 
services are generally provided under time and materials contracts and revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
in some circumstances  services are provided under fixed price arrangements in which revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revisions in estimates of costs to complete are reflected in operations in the period in which facts requiring those revisions become known 
the impact on the company of emerging areas such as the internet  on line services  and electronic commerce is uncertain 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to provide a product offering that will satisfy new customer demands in these areas 
in addition  standards for network protocols and other industry standards for the internet are evolving rapidly 
there can be no assurance that standards chosen by the company will position its products to compete effectively for business opportunities as they arise on the internet and in other emerging areas 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual procedures to protect its intellectual property rights 
despite the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that the company regards as proprietary 
there can also be no assurances that the company s intellectual property rights would survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection to the company 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to protect its proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
other factors that could affect the company s future operating results include the effect of publicity on demand for the company s products and services  general economic and political conditions  continued market acceptance of the company s products and services  the timing of services contracts and renewals  continued competitive and pricing pressures in the marketplace  new product introductions by the company s competitors  and the company s ability to complete fixed price contracts profitably 
year this section is a year readiness disclosure pursuant to the year information and disclosure act of in the past  many information technology systems were designed with two digit year codes that did not recognize century fields 
as a result  these technology systems may not function or may give incorrect results during the period surrounding the year the company s senior management sponsors a company wide year team to identify and resolve year issues associated with the company s internal information technology it systems  internal non it systems  material third party relationships  and the products and services sold by the company 
the company s year readiness program includes corporate awareness  adoption of year standards  inventory  assessment  remediation  validation testing  and contingency planning 
the company has identified its main internal it systems  has completed remediation of needed year related modifications  and has substantially completed testing 
the company has completed the assessment of its internal non it systems and has also completed its evaluation of third party relationships for year issues 
the company has designed the most current versions of its products to be year ready 
the company is communicating with its clients regarding the status of the company s products relating to year for products that were identified as needing updates to address year issues  the company has completed the updates of these products  and has made the updates available to clients in and some of the company s clients are using product versions that the company will not support for year issues  the company has encouraged these clients to migrate to current product versions that are year ready 
also  in certain client outsourcing and services contracts  the company is evaluating year issues for its clients computing environments and implementing year related remediations 
some of this client remediation effort was completed in with the remainder of the client remediation effort completed throughout the company has developed contingency plans to deal with issues that may arise during the period surrounding the year the focus of this effort was to identify high risk areas associated with mission critical functions and then to develop appropriate contingency plans 
the areas of planning include expected increases in client upgrade and support activities  problems caused by client delays in implementing company or third party upgrades  possible disruptions in the company s external support systems and internal systems  employee matters  and test exercises of contingency plan elements 
the company has funded its year program from operating cash flows and has not separately accounted for these costs in the past 
the company has incurred and will continue to incur additional amounts related to the year program for administrative personnel to manage the project and for technical support for its products  services  and internal it systems 
the company believes that the vast majority of these costs are not incremental to the company but represent a reallocation of existing resources and does not believe that these costs have been material to the company s financial position 
the company believes that it has taken adequate actions in planning for the period surrounding the year  however  there are no assurances that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences that could be caused by i undetected date issues in the company s products  ii services provided by the company in evaluating year issues for client outsourcing and services contracts  iii difficulties with internal it systems  and iv failures or disruptions of external support systems 
there can be no assurances that all year issues will be identified and remediated and it is possible that the company may experience increased expenses in addressing these issues 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include issues originating from clients who do not migrate to current product releases or who experience other year related problems  and issues originating from services provided by the company in evaluating year issues for client outsourcing and services contracts 
it is possible that any such issue could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and financial results 
some commentators have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by it 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management the company invests its cash in a variety of financial instruments  including state and municipal securities  corporate debt securities  and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
historically  the company s investment income has not been material to the company s financial results  and the company does not expect that changes in interest rates will have a material impact on the results of operations 
see note b to the financial statements for additional information with respect to the investment portfolio 
the company also has issued fixed rate debt  which is convertible to company stock at a pre determined conversion price 
convertible debt has characteristics that give rise to both interest rate risk and market risk because the fair value of the convertible security is affected by both the current interest rate environment and the price of the underlying company stock 
for the year ended september   the company s convertible debt  on an if converted basis  was not dilutive and  as a result  had no impact on the company s net income per share assuming dilution 
in future periods  the debt may be converted  or the if converted method may be dilutive and net income per share assuming dilution would be reduced 
see note f to the financial statements for additional information with respect to the company s long term debt 
although the company conducts business internationally  most of its contracts are denominated in the us dollar 
the company s primary international subsidiary s functional currency is the british pound 
foreign currency exposure is limited  as most financial assets and liabilities denominated in the foreign currency are short term in nature
