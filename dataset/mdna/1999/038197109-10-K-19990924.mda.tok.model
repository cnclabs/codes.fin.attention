overview the company was founded in colorado as applied films labs  inc on march  and was involved in both applied thin films research and development and limited thin films production 
on may   the company merged with donnelly coated corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of donnelly corporation of holland  michigan which was primarily involved in the manufacture and sale of thin film coated glass for lcds 
the company maintained manufacturing facilities and production capacity in both boulder  colorado and michigan  until the end of when the michigan facility and production capacity were no longer utilized 
since  the company had maintained all of its manufacturing operations in boulder  colorado 
during fiscal years and  the company relocated its boulder operations to a new headquarters and manufacturing facility in longmont  colorado 
during fiscal  the company expanded its thin film coated glass business to the far east by forming a joint venture with nippon sheet glass in suzhou  china 
the company s sales have been derived primarily from the sale of thin film coated glass to manufacturers of lcds 
sales and related costs of thin film coated glass sales are recognized when products are shipped 
historically  sales have varied substantially from quarter to quarter  and the company expects such variations to continue 
because a significant portion of the company s overhead is fixed in the short term  the company s gross profit and results of operations may be adversely affected by unexpected fluctuations in sales 
the company is typically able to ship its thin film coated glass within days of receipt of the order and  therefore  does not customarily have a significant long term backlog of thin film coated glass orders 
the company s ten largest customers for thin film coated glass accounted for  in the aggregate  approximately  and of gross sales in fiscal  and respectively 
prices for much of the company s tn thin film coated glass supplied to the lcd market have declined over the years  and the decline in prices slowed in the third quarter of fiscal the company expects continued downward pressure on its selling prices  which will negatively impact sales  gross profit and net income

many pacific rim countries continue to experience banking and currency difficulties that have led to economic recession in those countries 
the asian financial situation has affected capital spending plans by lcd and plasma display manufacturers 
certain plasma display manufacturers in japan and korea announced plans in fiscal to delay  by up to a year  commercialization of plasma displays which may impact their capital equipment purchases and resulting sale of equipment by the company 
as of july   the company s backlog from systems sales was approximately  versus  as of june  sales of thin film coated glass were derived primarily from demand by lcd manufacturers for low information content displays used in applications such as games  watches  calculators  cell phones etc

this condition fueled a price war and the industry experienced a drop in thin film coated glass prices of up to

net sales of thin film coated glass for fiscal totaled million versus million during fiscal year sales and related costs of thin film coated glass products are recognized when products are shipped 
sales of thin film coating equipment totaled million in fiscal versus million in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the company began recognizing revenue from the sale thin film coating equipment 
the company utilizes the percentage of completion accounting method for recognizing sales of equipment 
see item financial statements and supplementary data note significant accounting policies system sales 
for fiscal year  quarterly sales of thin film coating equipment were million for the first fiscal quarter  
million during the second fiscal quarter  million during the third fiscal quarter and 
million during the fourth fiscal quarter 
in comparison  sales of thin film coating equipment for fiscal year totaled million in the first fiscal quarter  million in the second fiscal quarter  million in the third fiscal quarter and million in the fourth fiscal quarter 
total gross profits decreased quarter over quarter from fiscal to fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profits decreased in the first and second quarters of fiscal versus the first and second quarters of fiscal gross profits as a percentage of sales increased in the third quarter and decreased again in the fourth quarter of fiscal versus the third and fourth quarters of fiscal as a percent of sales  gross profits declined from in to in this drop corresponds to the overall drop in selling prices for the thin film coated glass industry as well as the reduced revenues in the thin film coating equipment business 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased during the quarters of fiscal due to a concentrated cost reduction effort that included controls on overhead spending during the year as well as reduced commissions for thin film equipment sales 
included in the sg a expenses are one time charges totaling  for the completion of the relocation of its facilities to longmont and severance charges during fiscal interest expense was higher during fiscal versus fiscal due primarily to increased debt levels in fiscal other income increased for fiscal due primarily to higher foreign exchange gains 
income from joint venture was a new addition to applied films profit picture 
the stec joint venture was funded in january  began production in april  and closed its first quarter of operations as of july  profitably  contributing  to applied films bottom line 
because a significant portion of the company s overhead is fixed the company s quarterly results of operations may be materially affected if sales of thin film coated glass or thin film coating equipment decline for any reason 
the company expects fiscal quarterly sales  gross profits  operating income and net income to be at levels slightly ahead of the comparable quarters of fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company has primarily funded its operations with cash generated from operations  proceeds from an initial public offering of the company s common stock  and with borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to 
million for the corresponding period in fiscal due primarily to the reduction in inventory and proceeds from sale to the joint venture 
the company borrowed million against its line of credit to fund the initial capital requirements of its stec joint venture 
as of july   the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of million 
as of july   accounts receivable were approximately million 
the company has recently extended its million credit facility with a commercial bank 
the credit facility will expire on september  as of july   the company had approximately million outstanding on its credit facility 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended july  were million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the majority of capital spending in fiscal went to the development and construction of the new atx platform which was built and is located in applied films longmont facility 
capital expenditures of million in fiscal will consist primarily of expenditures to complete the new atx coating system as well as other thin film coating test equipment and support equipment 
the company believes that its working capital and capital resource needs will continue to be met by operations and borrowings under the existing credit facility 
the credit facility generally restricts the company s ability to make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  enter into capital leases or guarantee such obligations 
to remain in compliance with the credit agreement  the company must also maintain certain financial ratios 
the company expects cash flow from operations to improve in fiscal year versus fiscal year and expects its borrowings to remain constant under its credit facility 
year compliance the year issue is the result of computer systems that use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year  which may prevent such systems from accurately processing dates ending in the year and after 
this could result in system failures or in miscalculations causing disruption of operations  including  but not limited to  an inability to process transactions  to send and receive electronic data  or to engage in routine business activities and operations 
the company has completed a full assessment of all currently used computer systems as well as production and coating equipment systems and has corrected those areas that will be affected by the year issue 
the company did utilize outside vendors to assist in the upgrade of certain systems and estimates that the company is approximately complete with respect to its systems 
the company s goal is to have tested each of these systems for year compliance by the end of the first quarter of fiscal in addition to reviewing its internal systems  the company has begun formal communications with its significant vendors concerning year compliance 
there can be no assurance that the systems of other companies that interact with the company will be sufficiently year compliant so as to avoid an adverse impact on the company s operations  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not believe that its products and services involve any material year risks 
the company does not presently anticipate that the costs to address the year issue will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
although the company expects its internal systems to be year compliant as described above  the company intends to prepare a contingency plan early in the calendar fourth quarter addressing the steps to be taken if important external companies such as suppliers are not year compliant in a timely manner 
recent financial accounting standards board statement several new accounting standards have been issued in fiscal and that have impacted the company in fiscal year and will impact the company going forward 
management believes that these accounting standards will not have a material impact on the operating results of the company when implemented 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices 
the company is exposed to market risk through interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to its normal funding and investing activities 
approximately million of the company s borrowed debt is subject to changes in interest rates  however  the company does not use derivatives to manage this risk 
this exposure is linked primarily to the eurodollar rate  and secondarily to the prime rate 
the company has historically locked in eurodollar rates on day intervals  and has not experienced major fluctuations in rate 
the company believes that a moderate change in either the eurodollar rate or the prime rate would not materially affect operating results or financial condition of the company 
foreign exchange exposure the company is exposed to foreign exchange risk associated with its accounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies  primarily in japanese yen 
at july   the company had approximately  of its accounts receivable and million of its accounts payable denominated in yen versus june   when the company had approximately  of its accounts receivable and  of its accounts payable denominated in yen 
the company believes that a moderate change in the japanese yen us dollar exchange rate would not materially affect operating results or financial condition of the company 
notwithstanding the above  actual changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates could adversely affect the company s operating results or financial condition 
the potential impact is likely greater the greater the magnitude of the rate change
