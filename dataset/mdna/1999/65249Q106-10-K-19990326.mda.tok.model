introduction and overview newsedge corporation is the leading independent provider of global news and current awareness solutions for business 
the company s mission is to make news valuable for business 
newsedge services provide access to value added news over the internet or customer intranets 
the company aggregates and adds value to news and information from over  sources published by over one hundred global content providers 
this information is customized and filtered so that users can readily find the most important  relevant stories from the overwhelming volume of daily news that is available 
the market for news and current awareness is pursued by the company through two primary lines of business the enterprise business and the newspage business 
the enterprise business uses a direct selling effort and targets large organizations 
the enterprise services deliver news and information to large numbers of users within organizations through their corporate intranet or local area networks 
as of december   the company had over  enterprise customers  up from the previous year end  with approximately  users 
the newspage business operates newspage 
com  an internet web site that offers customized  business oriented news and information 
through a series of strategic relationships  the newspage business also provides news and information for a number of other internet web sites 
during  these relationships included netscape business journal and yahoo small business 
the newspage service is supported in part by targeted advertising and electronic commerce  and is offered to end users as either a free service for a basic package or as a subscription service for premium packages 
as of december   newspage had over  paid or registered users 
in an effort to gain market share  significant investment will be made in the newspage business over the next year 
in addition to the enterprise business and the newspage business  the company also reports a segment of other revenue  which consists of services which are being phased out by the company  and which the company expects to be immaterial beyond the company s enterprise revenues consist primarily of subscription fees related to the various enterprise product offerings 
additionally  enterprise revenues include royalty revenues generated from content sales billed directly by third party information providers to customers  revenue generated from professional consulting services and revenue generated from installations and related computer hardware sales 
the company s newspage revenues consist primarily of subscription fees generated from the premium newspage service offering  advertising sales and electronic commerce 
the company s other revenues consist primarily of subscription fees generated from sales of services being phased out by the company 
subscription agreements across all product segments are generally for an initial term of twelve months  payable in advance  and are automatically renewable for successive one year periods unless the customer delivers notice of termination prior to the expiration date of the then current agreement 
subscription revenues associated with these agreements are recognized ratably over the subscription term  beginning upon installation of the product 
accordingly  a substantial portion of the company s revenues is recorded as deferred revenue 
certain newswires offered by the company for use within its services are purchased by the customer directly from the news provider and payments are made directly from the newsedge customer to the provider 
for some of these newswires  the company receives royalty revenue based on payments made by the customer to the news provider 
for other newswires that are resold by the company to the newsedge customer  the company bills the customer for the newswire directly and then pays a royalty to the news provider 
such royalty expenses are included in the company s cost of revenues

year readiness disclosure statement the company has established a year compliance program 
the company has been performing year tests for the past three years and a formal organization structure of senior management and quality assurance personnel for support of year initiatives has been in place since april while the company anticipates that its services and internal systems should operate correctly at the turn of the century  unforeseen bugs or glitches with respect to the company s services or services of its vendors may arise 
compliance program the scope of the company s compliance program focuses on four key areas service offerings  third party information providers  business partners applications  and internal systems 
the company s compliance program has a three step process to evaluate each of the key areas which includes i inventory review  ii assessment testing  and iii resolution and contingency planning 

service offerings 
since the merger in february  the company has taken an inventory of existing services from its predecessor companies to review its overall compliance status 
the company is testing certain released services offered by the company  but has decided not to test those services that will be discontinued before the year as of december   the company had completed testing on approximately of its supported services and estimates completion of this test process by june  when testing services for year compliance  the company attempts to confirm that i news can be collected over the boundary from to  ii date fields with either two or four digit year formats will function correctly for years in the new millennium  iii date fields in both server and client log files will be displayed correctly  iv the services will be able to conduct searches for date ranges that overlap the new millennium  and v the year will be recognized as a leap year 
new services under development for this year and next have year qualification as part of their standard test plans 
none of these development projects have been impacted by the company s year readiness efforts 

third party information providers 
the company relies on content provided by third party information providers 
communication with the company s information providers with respect to their year compliance status was complete as of december  the company s goal is to have all information providers compliance responses complete by june  also  the company is trying to minimize its dependence on third party information provider s external date formats by internally generating timestamps on its server 
while the company is committed to taking every reasonable action to obtain assurances from such third party information providers that their software is year compliant  it can not guarantee the performance of such providers or predict whether the assurances provided by them may be accurate and realistic 

business partners applications 
the company s customers invest in third party software  some of which is supplied by the company s business partners for the purpose of integrating news into the customer s applications 
the company has identified such business partners and has requested from them the status of their year compliance efforts 
these communications were complete as of december  the company s goal is to have all business partners compliance responses received by june  additionally  the company has an arrangement with wavephore  a common carrier communications vendor  for the delivery of news and information from third party news providers who do not have their own broadcast communications capability 
wavephore has stated that it intended to have all of its products and services year compliant by december  while the company is committed to taking every reasonable action to obtain assurances from such business partners that their software is year compliant  it can not guarantee the performance of such business partners or predict whether any of the assurances provided by them may be accurate and realistic 

internal systems 
the company has completed its inventory of its internal systems and its assessment of such systems compliance status is complete  with an anticipated completion date of june  the scope of these systems ranges from accounting  payroll  communications  network hardware and applications  internet access  internal information systems  hosted customer servers  and production news refinery systems 
the majority of the company s internal systems and equipment are currently year compliant 
costs to date the company has not relied on outside consulting expertise for assessing its services or testing for year related issues 
the company is utilizing internal personnel to identify year readiness in its supported services  network hardware applications  internal business and information systems 
the company estimates that the total direct cost of the company s year compliance efforts will be approximately  the total time estimated for the project for internal employees would equate to approximately nine person years 
as of december   the company had spent approximately  these costs do not include estimates of indirect costs associated with time spent by the company s management or staff discussing year issues internally or with third parties 
such discussions are handled by existing employees through the ordinary course of business 
the company has not identified the need to hire additional staff specifically to address third party questions or concerns 
risks with regard to third party information suppliers  the company is addressing  through normal operating procedures  two categories of possible issues i a small percentage of wires may exhibit presentation issues with the new millennium and ii some third party information providers may have delivery problems associated with year issues 
the company is identifying presentation issues by internal quality assurance or editorial reviewers 
when identified  presentation issues are being handled by contacting the information provider who may correct the problem at the source or by having the company develop a workaround in the software 
the risks associated with delivery problems present more serious issues for the company as the company would be without certain news content 
the company will seek to obtain substitute news sources if specific news providers experience technical difficulties delivering their content as a result of a year problem  but the company cannot guarantee the availability of such substitute content 
in connection with the company s business partners applications  the company has developed alternative delivery solutions  such as the internet or leased line transmission  to be used if wavephore experiences similar delivery difficulties as discussed above 
the company estimates that in the worst case scenario  it would take approximately eight weeks for it to remedy such a delivery problem 
while the company does not anticipate a failure in its ability to deliver news  and has established contingency plans as discussed above  such a failure may i have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  ii require the company to incur unanticipated material expenses to remedy any problem and iii result in litigation due to the company s inability to fulfill its contractual obligations 
in such cases the company would likely suffer a disruption in its revenue stream and operations could be materially impacted 
for an additional discussion of the risks associated with the company s dependence on news transmission sources  see the risk factor section of this filing regarding dependence on news transmissions sources 
contingency plans at this time  the company s contingency plans relating to the above discussed year issues include i having additional support staff and programmers on call for january   in the event of a disruption of the company s services  ii seeking alternative news sources and iii preparing alternative news delivery mechanisms 
the company s assessment of its services and internal systems for year compliance will be an ongoing effort throughout the remainder of this year 
the information contained herein is the product of conclusions made from the information and test results available to the company at this time 
certain factors affecting future operating results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
management of growth and hiring of additional personnel the company has experienced growth in revenues and expansion of its operations which have placed significant demands on the company s management  development  sales and customer support staff 
continued growth will require the company to hire and retain more development  selling and customer support personnel 
the company has at times experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is an intensely competitive and time consuming process 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish its growth strategies 
continued difficulties with the recruiting and retention of personnel could adversely affect the company s ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion or to support satisfactorily its customers and operations  which could in turn  materially adversely affect its business  operating results and financial condition 
on october   the company announced that edward r 
siegfried will retire from his full time position as vice president finance and chief financial officer effective march  mr 
siegfried has served as vice president of finance since march at the time of this filing  the company had not identified a successor for mr 
siegfried 
fluctuations in quarterly results the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future depending on factors such as demand for its services  changes in service mix  the size and timing of new and renewal subscriptions from corporate customers  advertising revenue levels  the effects of new service announcements by the company and its competitors  the ability of the company to develop  market and introduce new and enhanced versions of its services on a timely basis and the level of product and price competition 
a substantial portion of the company s cost of revenue  which consists principally of fees payable to information providers  communications costs and personnel expenses  is relatively fixed in nature 
the operating expense levels of the company are based  in significant part  on their expectations of future revenue 
if quarterly revenues are below management s expectations  results of operations would be adversely affected because a relatively small amount of the company s costs and expenses will vary with its revenues 
future operating results uncertain the company s ability to increase its revenues will depend upon its ability to expand its sales force  to increase sales to new customers as well as increase penetration into existing customers 
in addition  as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the time required for the company to reach profitability is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
as a result  it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
although the company experienced growth in revenues in recent years  there can be no assurance that  in the future  the company will sustain revenue growth or be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis 
dependence on continued growth in use of the internet the company distributes certain services across multiple delivery platforms  including facsimile  electronic mail  and private networks based on lotus notes and other groupware products 
sales of certain of the company s services depend upon the adoption of the internet as a widely used medium for commerce and communication 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a recent phenomenon 
there can be no assurance that communication or commerce over the internet will become widespread or that extensive content will continue to be provided over the internet 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure  such as a reliable network backbone  or timely development and commercialization of performance improvements  including high speed modems 
in addition  to the extent that the internet continues to experience significant growth in the number of users and level of use  there can be no assurance that the internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed upon it by such potential growth or that the performance or reliability of the web will not be adversely affected by this continued growth 
the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  or due to increased governmental regulation 
changes in or insufficient availability of telecommunications services to support the internet also could result in slower response times and adversely affect usage of the web and the company s online services 
if the necessary infrastructure or complementary services necessary to make the internet a viable commercial marketplace are not developed  or if the internet does not become a viable commercial marketplace  the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
reliance on advertising revenues and uncertainty of the web as an advertising medium the internet is an unproven medium for paid advertising sponsorship of web based services such as the company s newspage product 
subscriptions to the web based service are partially subsidized by revenues from the sale of advertisements on the web pages of such services 
most of the company s advertising customers have only limited experience with the web as an advertising medium  have not devoted a significant portion of their advertising expenditures to web based advertising and may not find such advertising to be effective for promoting their services relative to traditional print and broadcast media 
the company s ability to generate significant advertising revenues to subsidize subscriptions to its web based services will depend upon  among other things  advertisers acceptance of the web as an effective and sustainable advertising medium  the development of a large base of users of the company s services possessing demographic characteristics attractive to advertisers  and the ability of the company to develop and update effective advertising delivery and measurement systems 
no standards have yet been widely accepted for the measurement of the effectiveness of web based advertising  and there can be no assurance that such standards will develop sufficiently to support web based advertising as a significant advertising medium 
in addition  there is intense competition in the sale of advertising on the internet  which has resulted in a wide range of rates quoted by different vendors for a variety of advertising services  which makes it difficult to project future levels of internet advertising revenues that will be realized generally or by any specific company 
competition among current and future web sites  as well as competition with other traditional media for advertising placements  could result in significant price competition and reductions in advertising revenues 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will sustain or increase current advertising sales levels 
failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the business information services industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and entry into the field by extremely large and well capitalized companies as well as smaller competitors 
enterprise business the company s enterprise business competes or may compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies 
large  well established news and information providers such as dow jones  lexis nexis  pearson  reuters and thomson  
market data services companies such as adp  bloomberg and bridge  
traditional print media companies that are increasingly searching for opportunities for on line provision of news  including through the establishment of world wide web sites on the internet  
large providers of lan based software systems such as lotus ibm and microsoft  which could  in the future  ally with competing news and information providers  and 
to a lesser degree  consumer oriented  advertising subsidized web based services and internet access providers 
many of the market participants named above have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company 
increased competition  on the basis of price or otherwise  may require price reductions or increased spending on marketing or software development  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
newspage business the company s newspage business competes directly with many other web based news and information services 
the market for internet services is relatively new  intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
the number of web sites on the internet competing for consumers attention and spending has proliferated and it is expected that competition will continue to intensify 
newspage competes  directly and indirectly  for advertisers  viewers  members and content providers with the following categories of companies 
publishers and distributors of traditional off line media  such as television  radio and print  including those targeted to business  finance and investing needs  many of which have established or may establish web sites  such as the wall street journal  cnn and cnbc  
general purpose consumer online services such as america online and microsoft network  each of which provides access to financial and business related content and services  
online services or web sites targeted to business  finance and investing needs  such as thestreet 
com and motley fool  and 
web search and retrieval and other online services  such as excite  inc  infoseek corporation  lycos  inc  yahoo inc  and other high traffic web sites  such as those operated by netscape communications corporation  which offer quotes  financial news and other programming and links to other business and finance related web sites 
it is anticipated that the number of direct and indirect competitors will increase in the future 
this could result in price reductions for advertising  reduced margins  greater operating losses or loss of market share  any of which would materially adversely affect the business of the company  results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to acquisitions management may from time to time consider acquisitions of assets or businesses that it believes may enable the company to obtain complementary skills and capabilities  offer new services  expand its customer base or obtain other competitive advantages 
such acquisitions involve potential risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  technology  services and personnel  completing and integrating acquired in process technology  diverting management s resources  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new employees and customers  and the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees 
dependence on cooperative marketing arrangements the company has entered into certain cooperative marketing agreements and informal arrangements with software vendors  web site sponsors and operators of online services  including microsoft  netscape  yahoo and dow jones 
these companies presently market services that compete directly with those of the company 
if the company s marketing activities with such companies were terminated  reduced  curtailed  or otherwise modified  the company may not be able to replace or supplement such efforts alone or with others 
if these companies were to develop and market their own business information services or those of the company s competitors  the company s business and results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
litigation risks a class action shareholder suit was filed against individual now the company  certain of its directors and officers and the underwriters of its initial public offering claiming that the defendants made misstatements  or failed to make statements  to the investing public in individual s prospectus and registration statement in connection with its initial public offering relating to the alleged existence of disputes between joseph a 
amram  individual s former chief executive officer  and individual 
on may   the us district court for the district of massachusetts dismissed the class action in its entirety 
plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the us court of appeals for the first circuit 
oral arguments were heard on december  on march   the united states court of appeals for the first circuit entered judgment affirming the district court s dismissal of the class action 
dependence on news providers a significant percentage of the company s customers subscribe to services provided by one or more of press association inc  a subsidiary of the associated press  dow jones  the financial times  reuters and thompson 
the company s agreements with news providers are generally for terms of one to three years  with automatic renewal unless notice of termination is provided before the end of the term by either party 
these agreements may also be terminated by the provider if the company fails to fulfill its obligations under the agreement 
many of these news and information providers compete with one another and  to some extent  with the company 
termination of one or more significant news provider agreements would decrease the news and information which the company can offer its customers and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
also  an increase in the fees required to be paid by the company to its information providers would have an adverse effect on the company s gross margins and results of operations 
because the company licenses the informational content included in its services from third parties  the company s exposure to copyright infringement actions may increase 
although the company generally obtains representations as to the origins and ownership of such licensed content and generally obtains indemnification for any breach thereof  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that indemnification will adequately compensate the company for any breach 
dependence on news transmission sources the company s news and information for certain of the newsedge services is transmitted using one or more of four methods leased telephone lines  satellites  fm radio transmission or the internet 
none of these methods of news transmission is within the control of the company  and the loss or significant disruption of any of them could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
many newswire providers have established their own broadcast communications networks using one or more of these three vehicles 
in these cases  the company s role is to arrange communications between the news provider and the newsedge customer s server 
for sources which do not have their own broadcast communications capability  news and information is delivered to the company news consolidation facility  where it is reformatted for broadcast to newsedge servers and retransmitted to customers through an arrangement between the company and wavephore  a common carrier communications vendor 
wavephore presently markets services that compete directly with those of the company 
wavephore is also the communications provider for many newswires offered by the company through newsedge services 
the company s agreement with wavephore expires on december  this agreement can be terminated earlier in the event of a material breach by the company of the agreement 
if the agreement with wavephore were terminated on short notice  or if wavephore were to encounter technical or financial difficulties adversely affecting its ability to continue to perform under the agreement or otherwise  the company s business could be materially and adversely affected 
the company believes that if wavephore were unable to fulfill its obligations  other sources of retransmission would be available to the company  although the transition from wavephore to those sources could result in delays or interruptions of service that could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
wavephore did experience technical difficulties in may due to the disablement of the panamsat galaxy iv satellite 
this disablement caused an interruption in the delivery of news services to between one third and one half of the company s customers 
the interruption was resolved in approximately ten days and did not have a material impact on the company s financial results 
risk of system failure or inadequacy the company s operations are dependent on its ability to maintain its computer and telecommunications systems in effective working order and to protect its systems against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
although the company has limited back up capability  this measure does not eliminate the significant risk to the company s operations from a natural disaster or system failure at its principal site 
in addition  any failure or delay in the timely transmission or receipt of news feeds and computer downloads from its information providers  due to system failure of the information providers  the public network or otherwise  could disrupt the company s operations 
risks relating to year issues the company believes that its software and services are substantially year compliant and currently does not anticipate material expenditures to remedy any year problems 
however  many computer systems were not designed to handle any dates beyond the year  and therefore  many companies will be required to modify their computer hardware and software prior to the year in order to remain functional 
the company utilizes third party computer and telecommunications equipment to produce and distribute its services as well as to operate other aspects of its business  and while the company is currently testing all such systems  there can be no assurances that such equipment is year compliant 
the company also is addressing two categories of possible issues relating to its third party information suppliers i a small percentage of wires may exhibit presentation issues with the new millennium and ii some third party information providers may have delivery problems associated with year issues 
the company is identifying presentation issues and when identified  they are being handled by contacting the information provider who may correct the problem at the source or by having the company develop a workaround in the software 
the risks associated with delivery problems present more serious issues for the company as the company would be without certain news content 
the company will seek to obtain substitute news sources if specific news providers experience technical difficulties delivering their content as a result of a year problem  but the company cannot guarantee the availability of such substitute content 
also  the company has developed alternative delivery solutions  such as the internet or leased line transmission  to be used if wavephore  a common carrier communications vendor that delivers news and information from certain third party news providers  experiences delivery difficulties due to the year problem 
the company estimates that in the worst case scenario it would take approximately eight weeks for it to remedy such a delivery problem 
while the company is committed to taking every reasonable action to obtain assurances from such business partners that their software and services are year compliant  it can not guarantee the performance of such business partners or predict whether any of the assurances provided by them may be accurate and realistic 
although the company does not anticipate a failure in its ability to delivers news  and has established contingency plans  such a failure may i have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  ii require the company to incur unanticipated material expenses to remedy any problem and iii result in litigation due to the company s inability to fulfill its contractual obligations 
in such cases the company would likely suffer a disruption in its revenue stream and operations could be materially impacted 
rapid technological change the business information services  software and communications industries are subject to rapid technological change  which may render existing services obsolete or require significant unanticipated investments in research and development 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon its ability to enhance its service offerings and keep pace with technological developments 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing services  to develop new services that address the needs of its customers and to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices  each on a timely basis 
services as complex as those offered by the company entail significant technical risks  often encounter development delays and may result in service failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
any such delays in development or failures that occur after commercial introduction of new or enhanced services may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
proprietary rights and intellectual property the company is heavily dependent upon proprietary technology 
in addition  the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and non disclosure agreements to protect its proprietary rights in its software and technology 
there can be no assurance that such measures are or will be adequate to protect the company s proprietary technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies or services 
the company licensed the proprietary smart filtering software  which is used as the filtering engine within the company s news refinery  from cornell research foundation  inc cornell university 
under the terms of the license agreement with cornell university  the company had exclusive worldwide rights until february to design  develop  market  and sell systems and services based on the smart software for the retrieval and dissemination of data from recent and continually changing data sources 
provided that the company does not default on the license agreement  the company will retain a continuing worldwide  non exclusive  perpetual royalty free right to use the smart software  and in addition  the company owns  and will continue to own  all enhancements to the smart software that it has developed 
there can be no assurance  however  that cornell university has not or will not license the smart software to a third party  including a competitor of the company 
in addition  cornell university may terminate the license agreement if the company has materially breached the agreement and such breach remains uncured for days after written notice of such breach has been given 
if the license agreement for the smart technology were to terminate  there can be no assurance that a replacement solution could be developed or acquired  on a timely basis or at all  and on favorable terms to the company 
consequently  any termination of the company s license agreement with cornell university would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
there has been substantial litigation in the information services industry involving intellectual property rights 
although the company believes that it is not infringing the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that such claims  if asserted  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  inasmuch as the company licenses the informational content that is included in its services from third parties  its exposure to copyright infringement actions may increase because the company must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such licensed content 
although the company generally obtains representations as to the origins and ownership of such licensed informational content and generally obtains indemnification to cover any breach of any such representations  there can be no assurance that such representations will be accurate or that such indemnification will provide adequate compensation for any breach of such representations 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce and protect trade secrets  copyrights and other intellectual property rights of the company 
the company may also be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
any such litigation would be costly and divert management s attention  either of which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of the company s proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities  require the company to seek licenses from third parties  and prevent the company from selling its services  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   the company did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of us treasury notes  us government agencies and corporate bonds 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  and therefore the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
historically  the company s primary exposures have been related to nondollar denominated operating expenses in canada 
the majority of company sales are denominated in us dollars 
the company has not determined what impact  if any  the introduction of the euro will have on its foreign exchange exposure 
the company is prepared to hedge against fluctuations in the euro if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the assets and liabilities of the company related to nondollar denominated currencies was not material
