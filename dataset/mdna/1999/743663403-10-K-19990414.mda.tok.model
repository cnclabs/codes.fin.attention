item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general approximately of our revenues in came from monitoring and servicing security systems located in single family homes  apartments and condominiums and businesses 
we had over million customers at december   most of whom pay us under contracts for our monitoring and other security services 
we also bill customers on a time and material basis for service visits if they do not have extended service contracts 
while we typically require payment for monitoring services in advance  we recognize monitoring and related services revenues only as we provide the service 
the remainder of our revenue is from the sale and installation of security systems  add ons and upgrades 
we recognize revenues from these other activities in the period of installation 
restatement 
we restated our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as a result of the restatement of the consolidated financial statements and certain other adjustments  we will also restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements reported on form k for and the first three quarters of the impact of the restatement on the quarterly results in have been reflected in note to the financial statements 
monthly recurring revenue 
at various times during the year  we measure all of the monthly revenue we are entitled to receive under contracts with customers in effect at the end of the period 
we had approximately million of monthly recurring revenue as of december  because protection one has grown rapidly  often by acquiring security alarm companies and portfolios of customer accounts which are included in results of operations only from the date of acquisition  its revenues are not proportional to the level of its investment of capital reported at the end of the period upon which a return must be earned 
management believes monthly recurring revenue enhances an investor s understanding of protection one s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows because it provides a measure of protection one s revenue that can be used to derive estimates of annual revenue acquired in the acquisitions for a full year of operations 
as a result  monthly recurring revenue can be compared to the level of investment in the statement of financial condition 
further  management believes an investor s consideration of monthly recurring revenue relative to the protection one s customer base helps identify trends in monthly recurring revenue per customer 
monthly recurring revenue does not measure profitability or performance  and does not include any allowance for future customer losses or allowance for doubtful accounts 
protection one does not have sufficient information as to the losses of acquired accounts to predict with absolute certainty the amount of acquired monthly recurring revenue that will be realized in future periods or the impact of the losses of acquired accounts on our overall rate of customer loss 
protection one s computation of monthly recurring revenue may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and monthly recurring revenue should not be viewed by investors as an alternative to actual monthly revenue  as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
our monthly recurring revenue includes billable amounts to customers with past due balances 
we seek to preserve the revenue stream associated with each customer contract  primarily to maximize our return on the investment we made to generate each contract 
as a result  we actively work to collect amounts owed to us and to retain the customer at the same time 
in some instances  we may allow up to six months to collect past due amounts  while evaluating the ongoing customer relationship 
after we have made every reasonable effort to collect past due balances  we will disconnect the customer and include the loss in our customer loss calculations described below 
our monitoring and related service revenues produce higher gross margins than any other of our revenue sources 
we provide other services  such as patrol and armed response and installations  because we believe such services contribute to the growth and retention of our customer base 
in most of our residential markets  we use a network of independent security system sales and installation companies to generate new monitoring customers for us 
in our multi family  commercial and foreign markets  we use an internal sales force to generate new customers 
in all markets  we believe we are using the most cost efficient and productive methods for growing our customer base 
customer and revenue losses 
like most monitored security companies  we invest significant amounts to generate new customers  and we seek to maintain long term relationships with our customers by providing excellent service 
we measure the loss of our customers and revenues to verify that our investment in new customers is generating a satisfactory rate of return and that our policy of amortizing the cost to acquire customer accounts over years is reasonable 
we calculate and report both gross customer losses and net monthly recurring revenue loss as meaningful statistics 
we calculate gross customer losses for a period by dividing the number of customers who disconnect service by the average number of customers outstanding during that period 
gross loss of customers was in and in included in customer attrition are unusual losses of approximately related to the customer base of wrsb 
we took a charge in related to these losses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in gross loss of customers reflect changes in acquisition activity  the rate at which customers move  the number of customers we disconnect for non payment and customer satisfaction with our monitoring  field repair and customer service functions 
note that a loss of a customer who moves but retains our service as a new customer in a new location is accounted for as a customer loss and an addition in calculating customer attrition rates 
further  the loss of a customer due to a move but the addition of a customer at the same residence is also accounted for as a customer loss and addition in calculating customer attrition rates 
we define net monthly recurring revenue losses for a period as gross monthly recurring revenue lost due to customer cancellations minus monthly recurring revenue added from connecting new customers who move into homes previously occupied by our customers  monthly recurring revenue added from converting competitor customers to our services  monthly recurring revenue of disconnected customers where a seller or dealer reimburses us for the customer purchase price  and monthly recurring revenue added from selling additional services and implementing rate increases to our existing customers 
we divide the result of deducting this total by the average amount of monthly recurring revenue to arrive at net monthly recurring revenue losses 
in  net monthly recurring revenue losses were  a decrease from in factors that cause gross customer losses to change also cause fluctuations in net monthly recurring revenue losses 
in addition  net monthly recurring revenue losses will change depending on our ability to sign up potential customers who move into homes previously occupied by our customers  convert competitor customers to our services  obtain purchase price reimbursements from sellers and dealers and continue to sell enhanced services and increase rates will cause net monthly recurring revenue losses to change 
to calculate item above  the reimbursement of customer purchase prices by sellers or dealers  we use the full dollar amount of customer contracts guaranteed by sellers or dealers in purchase agreements 
in some cases  however  we have not retained the entire portion of the seller or dealer guarantee even though it is specifically described in the purchase agreement 
if we used the actual amount of purchase price reimbursement by sellers or dealers  rather than the contractual amount  net monthly recurring revenue losses would have been higher in each period presented above 
as mentioned above  if future losses of customers were to increase substantially  we may be required to shorten the year period we use to amortize our investment in new customers 
the resulting increase in amortization expense could be significant 
as a result of discussions with the sec staff  we are reviewing our methodology for amortizing customer accounts 
while we believe our amortization method is consistent with industry practices  a significant change in the amortization method would likely have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations but would not reduce ebitda 
the net balance of customer accounts at december  was approximately billion 
change in customer base 
the table below shows the change in our customer base from to fiscal years ended december  beginning balance  january     installations by our personnel    additions through acquisitions and dealer purchases    gross customer losses    ending balance  december     the january  balance has been increased for customers acquired in the network multifamily security acquisition  which was completed effective january on november   protection one acquired the security business of western resources  expanding its customer base from approximately  customers to approximately  customers and expanding its service coverage from the western united states to most of the continental united states 
overview of activities in  we undertook the following notable acquisitions and financings the acquisition of network multifamily security corporation 
we acquired approximately  customers by purchasing the stock of network multifamily security on january  under the terms of a purchase option granted to protection one by western resources 
protection one paid approximately million for what we believe  based on our substantial industry experience and knowledge  to be the leading provider of security alarm monitoring services to apartment complexes and other multi family dwellings 
the acquisition of multimedia security services  inc 
we obtained approximately  customers and related assets  including a service center in wichita  kansas  when we purchased assets and liabilities of multimedia security services for approximately million in cash on march  the acquisition of comsec narragansett security  inc 
we obtained  customers located primarily in the northeast united states when we purchased all of the capital stock of comsec narragansett security for million  consisting of approximately million of cash and million of assumed debt  on march  a concurrent public offering and private placement of our common stock 
we issued  shares of common stock to the public and  shares of common stock to western resources for aggregate proceeds of approximately million on june  we issued an additional  shares to the public and  shares to western resources for aggregate proceeds of approximately million on june  the proceeds from these offerings were used to redeem million of protection one alarm monitoring s outstanding senior subordinated discount notes and to repay borrowings under our credit facility with westar capital  our controlling stockholder and a subsidiary of western resources 
a private offering of senior notes 
protection one alarm monitoring issued million of senior unsecured notes bearing an interest rate of and due in in a private offering completed on august  we used proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under our credit facility with westar capital 
the acquisition of cet 
we established a major presence in western europe by purchasing the common stock of this public company with  customers for approximately million in a series of transactions completed on september  in the purchase  we also assumed acquisition liabilities for recourse financing contracts sold to a third party finance company 
the refinancing of our credit facility with westar capital with a new million credit facility through a syndicate of banks 
we obtained a revolving credit facility from a syndicate of banks led by nationsbank na  concurrent with our offering of senior subordinated notes  discussed below  to substantially replace our credit facility with westar capital 
the proceeds of the new facility were used to repay the borrowings under the credit facility with westar capital 
we can borrow under this facility at a range of interest rates based on either the prime rate or an eurodollar rate 
our weighted average interest rate for the new senior credit facility at december  was 
the new senior facility matures in december a private offering of senior subordinated notes 
protection one alarm monitoring issued million of senior subordinated notes bearing an interest rate of and due in in a private offering completed on december  we used proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under the new credit facility 
results of operations we present the table below to show how our operating results have changed over the past two years 
next to each year s results of operations  we provide the relevant percentage of total revenues so that you can make comparisons about the relative change in revenues and expenses 
as we discussed in the highlights section above  results reflect the western resources security businesses for the entire year  and one month of the operations of protection one and centennial security each  while results reflect an entire year of the western resources security businesses  protection one  centennial security and all of the acquisitions since their respective closing dates 
fiscal years ended december  restated dollars in thousands revenues monitoring and related services   installation and rental   total revenues   cost of revenues monitoring and related services   installation and other   total cost of revenues   gross profit   selling  general and administrative expenses   acquisition and transition expense   amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense   other charges   operating income loss   compared to revenues for increased by million  or  to million from million for monitoring and related service revenues increased by million  or due to our acquisitions and new customers purchased through our dealer program 
the majority of additional revenues in were attributable to protection one s acquisitions 
we added approximately million of monthly recurring revenue from our acquisitions and approximately million of monthly recurring revenue from our dealer program 
because acquisitions and purchases from the dealer program occurred throughout the year  not all of the million of acquired monthly recurring revenue is reflected in results 
offsetting these revenue increases  we experienced net monthly recurring revenue losses of in installation and rental revenues  which consist primarily of revenues generated from installing new alarm systems  increased by to million in  as compared to million in in the us  at the time of the combination of the western resources security business with protection one  we committed to a plan to wind down all internal sales activities and increase reliance on the dealer program as a source of new customers 
we believe the dealer program is a less costly and more productive method of adding primarily residential customers 
we successfully completed this transition in june 
we have internal sales and installation capabilities in other areas  however  such as our multi family division  our commercial installations and our european operations  where we principally rent security systems 
we believe that an internal sales channel better serves the potential customer base for these classes of customers 
the installation activities of acquired businesses generated approximately million of installation revenues in  as compared to million in cost of revenues for increased by million  or to million from million for cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to during from during monitoring and related services expenses for increased by million  or to million from million in  due to the acquisition of three major service centers and three smaller satellite monitoring facilities in the us  as well as two service centers in canada and two in europe 
monitoring and service activities at our existing facilities increased as well  due to new customers generated by our dealer program 
monitoring and related services expenses as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenues increased to in from during the percentage increased due to the expenses of the acquired facilities  as well as expenses from several higher cost subcontract monitoring agreements 
we are reviewing our service centers to eliminate smaller satellite facilities 
we are committed to building a common monitoring software platform for all of our us service centers  which we believe will enable further service center consolidation 
in addition  we intend to exit a majority of our subcontract monitoring relationships in finally  we expect to see continued efficiencies in markets such as canada and europe from growing the customer base and better utilizing our service centers 
installation and other cost of revenues for increased by million  or  to million from million in the increase in expense reflects the cost of equipment  installation labor and other expenses incurred in the installation of security alarm systems 
installation and other cost of revenues as a percentage of other revenues increased to in from in acquired commercial installation activities generated lower profit margins due to declining installation revenues and the selling outright  rather than leasing  of security alarm systems 
gross profit for increased by million  or  to million from million in acquisitions and contribution of new customers by the dealer program produced the increase in gross profit 
as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit was for compared to for the decline in gross profit as a percentage of total revenues reflects the higher monitoring  field service and installation expenses noted above 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by million  or  to million from million in the increase in expenses resulted primarily from acquisitions  partially offset by a reduction in sales and related expenses 
the transition of our primary distribution channel from an internal sales force to the dealer program resulted in sales commissions declining by approximately million 
we also reduced advertising and telemarketing activities that formerly supported the internal sales force 
acquisition expenses for increased by million  or  to million from million in we aggregate expenses incurred in the acquisition and integration of customers in this line item 
these expenses include the replacement of yard signs and the reprogramming of alarm panels for new customers 
in we incurred million in additional customer transition costs  primarily yard signs for the western resource security business customers related to the merger of wrsb and protection one 
in  we incurred expenses to develop and manage our dealer program  as well as to contact  assimilate and solicit acquired and new customers for new services 
other acquisition expenses were incurred in connection with our dealer program and the costs related to maintaining an acquisition department in amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense for increased by million  or  to million from million in we spent approximately million to purchase customer accounts and incurred million in cost allocated to goodwill during from our purchases of security alarm companies  portfolios of customer accounts  and individual new customers through our dealer program 
we amortize customer accounts over years and goodwill over years  in each case using a straight line method 
additional considerations relating to our treatment of customer accounts are discussed under the heading forward looking statements we lose some of our customers over time 
protection one amortizes goodwill over a forty year life 
management believes that the use of a forty year estimated useful life is appropriate based upon the following factors the alarm monitoring industry has been in existence for over years 
management believes protection one will be a significant factor and participant in the long term future of the industry due to its size and market presence 
the existence of protection one monitoring equipment in the residential or commercial structure facilitates renewals by existing occupants and service to future occupants 
each customer contract typically contains an evergreen provision that causes a contract to automatically renew for successive periods unless either the customer or protection one gives notice of the cancellation 
based on historical experience  homeowners tend to renew the contracts through the life of home ownership  which can be an extended time period to avoid future installation charges 
our ability to sell additional services equipment on an upgrade or add on basis to the base of existing and future new customers is of value to protection one above and beyond the base customer contract 
a strong relationship with existing customers leads to referrals and potential new customers 
we have established an industry leading position from which we receive the benefit of a nationwide presence and economies of scale 
management has forecasted increasing penetration rates on an industry wide basis and believes that protection one s position as one of only five national providers will be of significant benefit 
the prospects for bundling a variety of utility and consumer products in the services business will strengthen our relationship with our customers 
ownership of protection one by our parent company  western resources  inc  supports this strategic outlook 
with the utility industry in the united states moving towards deregulation  opening formerly regulated markets to resale services  and bundling services under a strong brand  an established brand becomes more and more valuable to the owner of that base 
overall  these factors combine to create a unique competitive advantage  which survives the estimated useful life of our customer accounts and should add value to the organization over an extended period of time 
other charges for decreased by  or to million from million in we incurred million for severance and relocation expenses associated with a reorganization of our operations in late operating income for was million  compared to an operating loss of million in if we remove the impact of other charges in each of and  operating income increased from a loss of million in to operating income of million in interest expense  net for increased by million  or  to million from million in  reflecting our use of debt to finance a substantial portion of our customer account growth 
we expect to incur a greater amount of interest expense in based upon our borrowing base at december  but not considering additional borrowing in  as shown below at december estimated debt instrument interest rate  annual interest dollars in thousands revolving credit facility   senior unsecured notes   cet recourse financing agreements   senior subordinated debt   discount notes   convertible notes   total  the balance and interest rate applicable to our revolving credit facility will vary 
we may borrow up to million under our revolving credit facility at a floating interest rate based on several different published index rates subject to limitations provided in the agreement covenants 
currently  the interest rate options available to us are the prime rate  or a eurodollar rate plus a margin of basis points 
other non recurring income expense in totaled million of income  compared to zero in in  we recognized a non recurring gain on the repurchase of customer contracts covered by a financing arrangement with new york life secured asset management company  ltd 
samco  a third party  in the amount of million 
in  we recorded this obligation at million in the valuation of the assets and liabilities we acquired in the acquisition of westinghouse security system and increased the liability to million for increases in the market value of these accounts estimated to have occured in  recording the  increase as interest expense 
this amount was based upon management s estimate  as specified by the agreement  of the market value of the customer contracts considering the prices that large customer bases were being sold in the market  which was experiencing rapid consolidation and higher prices  verbal discussions with the third party on their expectations on settlement  and based upon the provisions of the financing agreement 
during  in a series of negotiations  we purchased the customer contracts for million 
we were successful in the settlement of a lower amount based upon the following it was determined through litigation in that we could immediately discontinue service to these customers if sold to a third party  there was an expectation that if sold to a third party  customer losses would occur upon transition of the accounts  and due to the reduction in of the market value of large customer bases in general  resulting from a reduction in the number of buyers and competition for large customer bases in the market 
we were able to sustain our position that a lower value was appropriate by entering into litigation and through the final mediation of the dispute between the parties 
during  we restructured our investment in guardian international  inc  exchanging our existing convertible preferred stock and common stock for a new series of redeemable preferred stock 
we recognized a non recurring gain of approximately million on this transaction 
as part of the restructuring  we also invested an additional million in guardian international  inc by purchasing shares of a new series of convertible preferred stock 
this new investment had no impact on our statement of operations 
comprised of approximately million of borrowings at the eurodollar rate plus  or approximately as of december   and approximately million of borrowings at the prime rate  or 
in summary  other non recurring income resulted from the following items fiscal year ended december  dollars in thousands non recurring gain on repurchase of samco contracts  non recurring gain on exchange of guardian securities  other  total non recurring other income  extraordinary gain for was  net of tax versus zero in this was due to the early retirement of debt in balance sheet data 
the table below compares several key statistics from our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and at december  restated dollars in thousands working capital deficit   customer accounts  net   goodwill   current liabilities   long term debt  net of current portion   stockholders equity   as of december   our working capital deficit was million  compared to working capital of million as of december  working capital represents current assets less current liabilities  including the current portion of long term debt 
the decline in working capital reflects reductions in our cash balance of approximately million and a decrease in the current portion of our income tax receivable of million 
an increase in current liabilities also contributed to the decline in working capital 
the most significant changes in current liabilities includes an increase of million in purchase holdbacks  an increase of million in the current portion of long term debt  and an increase of million in deferred revenue 
we generate purchase holdbacks when we acquire security alarm companies  portfolios of customer accounts or individual customer contracts from our dealer program 
we retain a portion of the purchase price in each case  subject to negotiation  to offset the loss of the acquired customers 
our purchase holdbacks typically represent between and of the purchase price  and typically are in effect for up to one year 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers in advance of providing service 
we expect deferred revenue to continue to fluctuate with the size of our customer base 
long term debt  net of current portion increased by million  reflecting the issuance of million of new debt  the assumption of long term debt obligations in our acquisitions  and offset slightly by the repayment of debt from the proceeds from our equity offerings 
stockholders equity increased by million  reflecting primarily the issuance of million of common stock in two offerings in june our retained losses increased from million at december  to million at december   reflecting a net loss of approximately million 
compared to as stated above  on november   protection one acquired the security business of western resources  the stock of centennial security holdings and additional cash and securities in exchange for million shares of protection one common stock 
as a result of the transaction  western resources obtained an ownership position in protection one and was treated as the accounting acquiror 
the table below shows results of operations of westinghouse security systems  the predecessor to the western resources security business  as well as results of operations of the western resources security business for and western resources acquired westinghouse security systems on december  to make a more informative comparison for investors  we add the results of westinghouse security systems to western resources security business results for  and discuss changes in from the total of the two columns as shown below protection one predecessor fiscal years ended december  fiscal year ended december  restated dollars in thousands dollars in thousands revenues monitoring and related services    installation and rental    total revenues    cost of revenues monitoring and related services    installation and other   total cost of revenues    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    acquisition and transition expense  amortization of intangibles and depreciation expense   other charges  operating income loss   revenues for were million with million related to wrsb  million related to centennial security  and million related to protection one 
the western resources security businesses revenues for were million and westinghouse security revenues for were million for a total of million 
wrsb monitoring and service revenues increased by million  or  substantially all of which resulted from average account base growth 
wrsb other revenues decreased by million  or 
the decrease comes from a reduction of in internally placed accounts  offset partially by an increase in average placement revenue per account of 
a sales force transition related to the mergers between westinghouse and wrsb and wrsb and protection one caused the decrease in internally placed accounts 
cost of revenues for was million with million related to wrsb  million related to centennial security  and million related to protection one 
cost of revenues for was million for wrsb and million for westinghouse security for a total of million 
wrsb monitoring and service costs increased by million  or  primarily due to the additional personnel required to provide service to a larger account base 
gross profit for was million with million related to wrsb  million related to centennial security  and million related to protection one 
gross profit for was million for wrsb and million for westinghouse security for a total of million 
gross profit for wrsb increased by million  or  reflecting growth in the average account base 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million with million related to wrsb  million related to centennial security  and million related to protection one 
selling  general and administrative expense for was million for wrsb and million for westinghouse security for a total of million 
wrsb selling  general and administrative expense increased by million  or  because of new advertising efforts to establish market awareness of the westar security services business name and million related to the costs of consolidating these operations 
amortization of intangibles and depreciation expenses for were million with million related to wrsb  million related to centennial security  and million related to protection one 
amortization and depreciation expenses for were million for wrsb and million for westinghouse security for a total of million 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or for wrsb due to the amortization of million of goodwill arising from the acquisition of westinghouse security 
the goodwill is amortized over years 
in addition  when westinghouse security was purchased  we wrote up customer accounts to their fair market value 
the value of customers accounts is amortized over years and has consequently increased amortization expense in compared to other charges 
in december  protection one incurred charges of million to reflect the impairment of assets and the closing of business activities of the western resources security business that were no longer of continuing value to the combined operations 
these charges were as follows fiscal year ended december  dollars in thousands impairment of customer accounts  merger related costs inventory and other asset losses  disposition of fixed assets  closure of duplicate facilities  severance compensation and benefits  total charges  impairment of customer accounts protection one wrote down the value of the customer base of the western resources security business due to excess customer losses experienced in the excess customer losses were due to the effects of transitioning the customer base from one service provider to another and the relative quality of certain classes of the customer accounts acquired in the westinghouse security systems acquisition due to use of a prior aggressive marketing plan accompanied by limited credit checking by westinghouse 
inventory and other asset losses protection one reduced the value of inventory held at branches due to conversion to the external dealer program as its primary marketing channel 
disposition of fixed assets protection one reduced the net book value of computer and telecommunication equipment due to plans to migrate in the first quarter of certain monitoring  customer service and financial operations to new software and hardware platforms 
at december   we continue to use certain of this equipment due to unplanned delays experienced in the implementation of replacement systems 
the remaining equipment is expected to be fully retired in closure of duplicate facilities protection one committed to a plan to close wrsb branch locations in cities with two or more branches and our customer base did not justify such a large presence 
at december   all such locations were closed and the amount accrued at december  had been expended except for remaining payments on vacated leased facilities under non cancellable agreements 
severance compensation and benefits upon closing of the merger in november  the affected employees were notified of their severance package 
actual payments approximated the amount accrued 
protection one faces year issues 
an issue exists for all companies that rely on computers as the year approaches 
the year problem is the result of the past practice in the computer industry of using two digits rather than four to identify the applicable year 
this practice could result in incorrect results when computers perform arithmetic operations  comparisons or data field sorting involving years later than we are reviewing our computer programs  computer hardware and embedded systems that we have identified as critical to our businesses and operational needs to assess and correct any components that could be affected by the change of the date to january  we have substantially completed the review and assessment of our systems  however  we will continue our review of systems as the need arises or prudency dictates  until january   particularly with respect to the acquisition of businesses that include the acquisition of additional information technology systems or non information technology systems and equipment  such as electrical  heating and cooling systems 
in addition  changes in the state of compliance or preparedness within companies that provide services or equipment to us will require us to continue these evaluations 
protection one plan we established a formal year readiness program to investigate and correct year problems in our information technology and non information technology systems 
the plan is primarily being implemented by each of our business units with on going review by management 
our year readiness program addresses commercial computer software  including mainframe  client server and desktop software  internally developed computer software  including mainframe  client server and desktop software  computer hardware  including mainframe  client server and desktop  network  communications and peripherals  devices using embedded computer chips  including controls  sensors  facilities equipment  heating  ventilating and air conditioning equipment  and relationships with third party vendors and suppliers 
the goal of our year readiness program is to identify and assess all computer programs  computer hardware and embedded systems critical to its business and operational needs that could be potentially affected by the year date change  repair or replace such systems found to be incompatible with year dates  and develop and implement predetermined actions to be used as contingencies in the event any critical business function fails unexpectedly or is interrupted 
our program is directed by a written policy that provides guidance and methodology for the departments and business units to follow 
due to varying degrees of exposure of departments and business units to the year issue  some are further along in the readiness process than others 
in connection with our review of the progress made by our departments and business units  we intend to take such actions as we deem necessary to ensure that all of its departments and business units complete the year readiness program on a timely basis 
we have largely completed the remediation and initial testing phase of our plan with respect to our north american monitoring operations where problems that were identified are being corrected and tested 
the majority of our current efforts are in the planning of contingencies and verification of year readiness  although our mobile services and european business units are expending the majority of their current efforts on the identification  remediation and testing phase of our plan 
our year policy requires testing as a method for verifying the year readiness of business critical items 
for those items that are impossible to test  other methods may be used to identify the readiness status  provided adequate contingency plans are established to provide a workaround or backup for the item 
development of contingency plans commenced in january and is scheduled to conclude in june  except for our european business unit which is expected to conclude this phase in the third quarter of we estimate the total cost to update all critical operating systems for year readiness will be approximately million  although no assurances can be given that costs will not materially exceed this amount 
as of december   approximately million of these costs had been incurred 
these costs include labor for both company employees and contract personnel used in the year program  and non labor costs for software tools used in the remediation and testing efforts  replacement software  replacement hardware  replacement embedded devices and other such costs associated with testing and replacement 
management continues to review the projected costs associated with the year readiness program  however  there can be no assurance that its actual cost of compliance will be as projected 
to date  the costs of the year readiness program have been substantially all information technology related 
non information technology systems are highly critical to our business  but are largely beyond our ability to control 
this includes  telephone  electricity  water  transportation and governmental infrastructure 
we have twelve major call centers and or monitoring centers two in irving  texas  beaverton  oregon  wichita  kansas  chatsworth  california  orlando  florida  hagerstown  maryland  vancouver  british columbia  ottawa  ontario  basingstoke  united kingdom  paris  france  and marseilles  france each of which operates different applications and databases 
while some business interruptions are possible  year related shutdown of all of our major sites is not considered likely 
most reasonably likely worst case scenario based on the results of our on going review  we believe that we have identified and remediated business critical issues such that the year issue will not pose material operational problems 
however  the most reasonably likely worst case scenario is to be found in the area of external services  specifically firms providing electrical power  heating  ventilating and air conditioning  and local and long distance telecommunications 
while we believe the total collapse of service providers is highly unlikely  one or more of the following scenarios could occur temporary disruption or unpredictable provision of nationwide long distance service  temporary or unpredictable provision of local telephone service  or temporary interruption or unpredictable provision of electrical power 
to the extent customers did not receive timely and adequate responses to alarms  we would be required to rely on the legal disclaimer of liability for the acts or omissions of third party agencies contained in our standard form of customer agreement and  we believe  in most of the customer agreements that we have acquired through acquisitions 
the enforceability of such disclaimers may be subject to judicial scrutiny in jurisdictions in which we operate 
conclusion we estimate the cost associated with the assessment of risk and the execution of corrective action to be approximately million 
the costs of the year project and the date on which protection one plans to complete the year modifications  estimated to be during  is based on the best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  and similar uncertainties 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we believe we maintain the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund future operations of the business 
generally  the cash will be generated from a combination of our existing million senior credit facility  which had approximately million of availability at year end subject to compliance with the provisions of the debt covenants in the agreement  as well as recurring revenue from our security monitoring customer base which generated million of positive recurring ebitda in cash flow from operations per the statement of cash flows was million 
ebitda does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be construed as an alternative to operating income and is indicative neither of operating performance nor cash flows available to fund our cash needs 
items excluded from ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance 
we believe that presentation of ebitda enhances an understanding of our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows because ebitda is used to satisfy our debt service obligations and our capital expenditure and other operational needs as well as to provide funds for growth 
in addition  ebitda is used by senior lenders and subordinated creditors and the investment community to determine the current borrowing capacity and to estimate the long term value of companies with recurring cash flows from operations 
our computation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
operating cash flows for the year ended december  our operating activities provided net cash flows of million  which was a significant improvement over the prior fiscal years in which our operating activities were a net user of cash 
we believe this improvement is due to increased recurring revenue generated from both price increases in the marketplace and additional customer accounts added from our dealer program  as well as numerous business combinations 
additionally  we continue to realize the benefits of centralized management  monitoring and other administrative functions applied to a growing customer base  resulting in improved operating cash flows 
investing cash flows during  we used a net million in investing activities  primarily to purchase new customer accounts from our external dealers and to acquire other alarm monitoring businesses 
this activity was consistent with the growth model of prior years 
we believe  however  that the investing activity will not approach the volume or the dollar amount of this year s activity 
financing cash flows during  we substantially financed our acquisition activity using the following instruments concurrent public and private placement of million of our common equity in june  issuance of million of senior unsecured notes in august  issuance of million of senior subordinated notes in december  and replacement of our million senior credit facility maintained with our parent  western resources  with a million credit facility maintained with a syndicate of banks 
material commitments 
as a result of the financing activities  as well as prior year activity  we have future  material  long term commitments which are listed below 
we believe these commitments will be met through a combination of refinancings and positive operating cash flows 
as of december   we have no financing commitments that will be required to be repaid in the next twelve months 
convertible senior subordinated notes million principal is due in september of these notes are convertible into protection one common stock at a price of per share  which is currently above the price at which our shares are traded in the public stock markets 
senior subordinated discount notes million principal is due in june senior unsecured notes million principal is due in august senior subordinated notes million principal is due in january revolving credit facility at december   million was drawn down on our million credit facility  which expires in december as we discussed above  based upon current debt levels we estimate annual interest payments associated with these debt instruments  to total approximately million 
it is likely that our interest expense in will be higher than this estimate  because we anticipate borrowing additional amounts under our revolving credit facility 
all of these debt instruments contain restrictions based on ebitda 
ebitda is derived by adding to income loss before income taxes  the sum of interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
our revolving credit facility requires us to meet financial covenants and the indentures relating to our public notes require us to meet financial covenants to borrow additional funds 
these financial requirements under the revolving credit facility and the indentures are summarized below debt instrument financial covenant revolving credit facility total consolidated debt annualized most recent quarter ebitda less than to through and to thereafter consolidated annualized most recent quarter ebitda latest four fiscal quarters interest expense greater than to senior subordinated notes current fiscal quarter ebitda current fiscal quarter interest expense greater than to senior subordinated discount notes total debt annualized fourth quarter ebitda less than to senior debt annualized fourth quarter ebitda less than to at december   we were in compliance with all of these financial covenants except for a violation of the provisions of the revolving credit facility resulting from the need to restate our financial statements for and the first three quarters of we have obtained a waiver of this requirement from the lenders under the revolving credit facility until such time that our restated financial statements are filed with and accepted under the revolving credit facility 
these debt instruments also restrict the ability of protection one to pay dividends to stockholders  but do not otherwise restrict our ability to fund cash obligations 
recent developments 
in october  we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire lifeline systems  inc  a leading provider of hour personal response monitoring services in north america 
based on the average closing price of protection one common stock for the three trading days prior to april   the consideration in the transaction will approximate million in cash and common stock of protection one  based on the number of shares of currently outstanding lifeline common stock 
we estimate that approximately of the purchase price  or approximately million  will be funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the remainder through the issuance of protection one common stock 
we have offered shareholders of lifeline systems  inc the option to receive additional shares of protection one common stock in lieu of all or a portion of the cash consideration 
closing the purchase of lifeline systems  inc is contingent upon the effect  if any  the restatement of the protection one financial statements will have upon the provisions of the merger agreement between lifeline and protection one 
the protection one board of directors authorized a private placement of common shares to westar capital  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of western resources 
the private placement will allow westar capital to maintain ownership in excess of of the issued and outstanding shares of protection one s common stock following the issuance of shares of common stock to stockholders of lifeline systems  inc in connection with the acquisition of lifeline systems by protection one 
under the private placement  protection one common stock will be issued to westar capital at a price equal to the average closing price determined in connection with the mergers related to protection one s acquisition of lifeline systems 
western resources also indicated that westar capital may acquire shares of protection one common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions 
any open market or private purchases by westar capital will reduce or eliminate the need for it to purchase shares in the private placement in order to maintain at least an ownership stake in protection one 
westar capital currently owns approximately million shares  or about  of protection one s million issued and outstanding shares 
capital expenditures 
we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately million in of such amount  we believe we will invest million to complete the development and installation of our new software platforms  million for replacement of vehicles  million for computer hardware to replace and upgrade existing operations and million for other capital items 
these are estimates and actual expenditures for these and possibly other items not presently anticipated may vary from these estimates during the course of item a 
market risk disclosure market price risks we are exposed to market risk  including changes in the market price  foreign currency exchange rates  equity instrument investment prices  as well as interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rates during  we acquired overseas operations which have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as of december  the unrealized loss on currency translation  presented as a separate component of stockholders equity and reported within other comprehensive income was approximately million pretax 
from the date of acquisition of such operations  the weighted average based on net assets currency exchange rate fluctuated  on an annualized basis 
a change in the currency exchange rates would have approximately a million effect on other comprehensive income 
equity instrument investments we have approximately million of marketable securities  as of december  we do not hedge these investments and are exposed to the risk of changing market prices 
interest rate exposure we have approximately million of long term variable rate debt as of december  a change in the debt benchmark rate would impact net income by approximately million
