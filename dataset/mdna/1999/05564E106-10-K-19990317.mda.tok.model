in as compared to  although total revenues increased approximately 
this relatively small decrease is due to the efficiencies of administering a larger portfolio being offset in part by start up costs in establishing new regional offices the company added new regions in connection with the transaction and the relocation of its corporate office

no assurance can be given that these properties will be completed or  if completed  that they will be completed by the estimated dates or for the estimated amounts set forth in the table below or that they will contain the number of proposed units set forth in the table below dollar amounts in millions investment proposed to date estimated estimated property name and number december  cost to estimated completion location of units complete total cost date pinnacle at flamingo west  las vegas  nv q pinnacle at blue ravine  folsom  ca q w

as of december   the company had not committed to significant construction contract obligations for these properties except for pinnacle sonata  where contracts have been executed for preliminary site preparation work 
these projects consist of land owned by the company where construction is ready to commence subject only to obtaining certain construction plans and permits and required financing 
the company expects to finance the development and construction of these communities through joint venture arrangements  or through its line of credit facility or other debt or equity sources  although there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained 
impact of inflation over of the company s total revenues for were derived from apartment properties 
due to the short term nature of most apartment leases typically one year or less  the company may seek to adjust rents to mitigate the impact of inflation upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases  although there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adjust rents in response to inflation 
in addition  occupancy rates may also fluctuate due to short term leases that permit apartment residents to leave at the end of each lease term at minimal cost to the resident 
year considerations some of the company s older computer programs were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  those computer programs have time sensitive software that recognizes a date using as the year rather than the year this could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in other normal business activities 
as of december   the company had completed a project which replaced portions of its software so that its computer systems will function properly with respect to dates in the year and thereafter 
the total year project cost for the company s systems was approximately  and such costs were expensed according to the company s existing policy 
the company completed the necessary software replacement largely using existing employees 
the company believes that with the conversions to new software  the year issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems 
at this time  no estimates can be made as to any potential adverse impact resulting from the failure of third parties  including tenants  vendors and financial institutions  to address year issues 
for example  to the extent payments  deposits and other transactions are not processed on a timely basis by financial institutions  the company s ability to collect payments from tenants and or make payments to its creditors could be adversely affected 
the company is dependent on such third parties to assess the impact of the year issue on their systems and to take any necessary corrective action 
however  as a component of its year project  the company is in the ongoing process of discussing year compliance issues with its key vendors and service providers and is developing contingency plans  although there can be no assurance that these contingency plans will successfully avoid service interruption 
due to the complexity and pervasiveness of the year issue and  in particular  the uncertainty regarding the compliance programs of third parties  no assurance can be given that these estimates will be achieved  and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled  down from  at the end of borrowings under the company s line of credit totaled  at december   compared to  at december  drawings on the line of credit are available to pay dividends to shareholders and distributions to minority members  to fund capital improvements and operating expenses  as well as to fund property acquisitions and development 
the company typically reduces its outstanding balance on the line of credit with available cash balances 
borrowings of up to  are available under the company s line of credit  with  available at december  the line of credit matures in august and bears interest at the lower of libor plus 
or a rate based on bids of the participating banks 
cost of the line of credit is per annum on the total commitment amount 
the company had a total of  in unsecured indebtedness other than the line of credit at december   consisting of the following  of unsecured senior notes with an interest rate of per annum as to  and per annum as to  this indebtedness is to be repaid through scheduled principal payments in the years from to   principal amount of unsecured senior notes due  with an effective interest rate of approximately  and  principal amount of unsecured notes due issued in february with an effective interest rate of 
in addition  at december   the company also had mortgage indebtedness totaling  at interest rates ranging from to  with remaining terms of from less than one to years 
for additional information regarding the company s line of credit  unsecured senior notes payable and mortgage loans payable  including scheduled principal payments over the next five years  see notes and to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s indebtedness contains financial covenants as to minimum net worth  interest coverage ratios  maximum secured debt and total debt to capital  among others 
the company was in compliance with all such financial covenants during the year ended december  the company purchased seven completed apartment communities and one addition to an existing community totaling  units during the year ended december  for a gross purchase price of approximately million 
during this period  the company also purchased five sites for development of an estimated  units for a gross purchase price of approximately million 
further  the company funded approximately million for construction of communities under development in the year ended december  these acquisition and construction costs were funded by borrowings on the line of credit  the issuance of the million of unsecured senior notes  equity offerings  proceeds from the sale of properties  the issuance of minority interest and the assumption of secured debt 
because of higher prices and corresponding declining rates of return on completed apartment communities in its targeted western markets  the company presently does not anticipate significant acquisitions of completed apartment communities in the company intends to meet its short term liquidity requirements through cash balances and cash flows provided by operations  borrowings on the unsecured line of credit and to a lesser extent  proceeds from asset sales 
the company believes that its cash flow and cash available from its line of credit will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs during  which include normal recurring expenses  debt service requirements  budgeted expenditures for improvements to certain properties  funding ongoing construction in progress and distributions required to maintain the company s real estate investment trust qualification under the code 
however  the company anticipates that it will continue to require outside sources of financing to meet its long term liquidity needs beyond  such as scheduled debt repayments  construction funding and property acquisitions 
at december   the company had committed to purchase approximately million of multifamily communities estimated to fund in the year and had an estimated cost of million to complete existing construction in progress funding estimated during and 
to facilitate the acquisition of public capital  the company filed a universal shelf registration statement in march providing for the issuance of up to million in equity  debt  preferred or convertible securities  of which approximately million remains unused at december  in january  the company issued million of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock  reducing the amount available on the universal shelf registration to approximately million 
the proceeds from this issuance were used initially to pay down outstanding balances on the line of credit 
the company believes that public capital markets will not be  for the foreseeable future  as significant a source of funding as they have in the two years ended december  the company is actively searching for other sources of possible funding  including joint ventures and secured construction debt 
further  the company owns unencumbered real estate assets which could be sold or used as collateral for financing purposes subject to certain lender restrictions and has encumbered assets with significant equity which could be further encumbered should other sources of capital not be available 
substantially all of the properties acquired in the transaction were held through bre property investors llc the operating company and blue ravine investors  llc blue ravine 
both the operating company and blue ravine are consolidated subsidiaries of the company and delaware limited liability companies 
on december   blue ravine was merged into the operating company  whereupon the operating company units of blue ravine became operating company units oc units in the operating company 
bre is the sole managing member of the operating company and as of december  held approximately of the outstanding oc units 
the remaining oc units of the operating company are held by third parties as non managing members 
the oc units held by holders other than the company are exchangeable  at the option of the holders thereof  into common stock of the company or  at the option of the company  cash in an amount equal to the market value of such common stock at the time of the exchange 
as of december   no oc units have been exchanged

between  and  oc units valued at between million and million using a value of per oc unit as provided for in the contribution agreement which governs the transaction are issuable in connection with the completion of certain budget and schedule objectives relating to these communities 
as of december    oc units have been issued for three communities  a total of between  and  oc units remain to be issued for the remaining five communities 
upon issuance  these oc units will also be exchangeable into common shares of the company on the same basis as other oc units 
there can be no assurance that these communities will be completed within the budget and time frame established 
under the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing the operations of the operating company the llc agreement  the non managing members are entitled to receive certain distributions of cash prior to the company 
if the operating company s cash available for distribution is not sufficient to permit such priority distributions  the company is required to make certain capital contributions to the operating company 
the operating company is also required to maintain certain debt service coverage  debt to asset and other financial ratios intended to protect the members rights to receive priority distributions  and under the terms of the llc agreement  among other items  the properties owned by the operating company may not be sold in a taxable transaction without the consent of the non managing members for up to ten years from the closing of the transaction

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s unsecured line of credit 
the company primarily enters into fixed and variable rate debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the company continuously evaluates its level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
the company did not have any derivative financial instruments at december   but has in previous years 
in each of and  the company closed out treasury rate lock agreements in conjunction with the issuance of its million unsecured senior notes due issued in june and million unsecured senior notes due issued in february the purpose of these treasury rate lock agreements was to obtain what the company considered advantageous pricing for future anticipated debt issuance 
the fair values of bre s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and short term investments  other assets  mortgage loans  accounts payable and other liabilities and unsecured line of credit approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms  and interest rates which approximate current market rates 
the fair value of mortgage loans payable and unsecured senior notes is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses with an interest rate similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements 
the fair value of the company s mortgage loans payable and unsecured senior notes approximates their carrying value at december  the company had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would have had an annualized unfavorable impact of approximately  and  respectively  on the company s earnings and cash flows based upon these year end debt levels 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt and therefore its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to the company at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
