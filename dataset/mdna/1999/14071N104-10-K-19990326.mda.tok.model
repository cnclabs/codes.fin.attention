results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of income 
year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative non recurring charges total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income net sales the company derives net sales primarily from initial sales of software kits and licenses and fully integrated systems  as well as follow on sales of add on software modules and product upgrades 
sales to dealers and distributors are recognized when the products are shipped 
the sales mix among the company s product categories and between software kits and fully integrated systems affects both net sales and gross margin 
because of their hardware components  fully integrated systems generate higher revenue per unit and lower margins than comparable software kits 
advanced cti application systems generally are sold at a higher unit price and with a higher gross margin than basic messaging systems due to the additional software modules purchased and the higher mix of software kits and software licenses as compared to fully integrated systems 
over the past three years  sales have shifted toward higher margin advanced cti products and software kits from lower margin cti ready systems and basic messaging products  but there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
see risk factors fluctuations in quarterly operating results  limited backlog and declining average sales prices 
years ended december  and net sales increased to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from increased sales of enhanced fax products and a full year of sales from our commercepath business unit  which on a combined basis increased in  and represented of net sales  as compared to of net sales in sales of advanced messaging and call center systems continued to strengthen during and constituted of total product sales in the lower margin basic messaging market continued to be affected by price pressures from competitive offerings

basic messaging sales declined in from  and represented of net sales in compared to of net sales in gross profit years ended december  and gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in  as compared to in  due primarily to the favorable sales mix of enterprise fax products and advanced cti applications and the declining sales of basic messaging systems 
years ended december  and gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved to in  as compared to in  due primarily to the favorable sales mix of advanced cti applications as compared to basic messaging systems 
gross profit on basic messaging system sales in continued to be negatively affected by price erosion and a higher ratio of fully integrated systems as compared to advanced cti application systems 
research and development years ended december  and research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to increased personnel costs relating to acceleration of certain development projects  and a full year of research and development expenses associated with commercepath 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses represented in  as compared to in years ended december  and research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to increased personnel costs relating to acceleration of certain development projects  the inclusion of the recently formed call center development group  which was acquired from telcom technologies  and research and development expenses associated with commercepath 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses represented in  as compared to in selling  general and administrative years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to the inclusion of commercepath expenses for the entire year as well as increased personnel related costs of domestic and international development of both the telephony oriented and computer oriented distribution channels 
selling  general and administrative expenses for included amortization of million of goodwill relating to acquisitions compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in  as compared to in years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  due primarily to increased personnel related costs of domestic and international development of both the telephony oriented and computer oriented distribution channels  the new product launches of callxpress for windows nt and agentxpress for windows nt  and the inclusion of commercepath expenses for the last two months of selling  general and administrative expenses for included amortization of million of goodwill relating to acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative expenses represented of net sales in  as compared to in non recurring charges in february  the company withdrew a follow on stock offering originally filed in october and wrote off the costs of  in connection with the canceled offering 
in connection with the acquisitions of telcom technologies and commercepath  the company recognized nonrecurring charges of million and million in the first and fourth quarters of  respectively  for the write off of purchased  in process research and development 
the company recognized a nonrecurring charge of million in the first quarter of for the write off of purchased  in process research and development associated with the acquisition of rightfax 
other income  net for the years ended december  and  other income remained constant at million 
other income increased to million in from million in due to increased cash and investment balances 
income tax expense the effective income tax rate in  and was  excluding acquisition related charges 
the acquisitions of telcom technologies and commercepath in were taxable transactions  and  therefore  the resulting excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired is deductible for income tax purposes 
by contrast  the excess of the purchase price over net tangible assets acquired associated with the acquisition of rightfax in is not tax deductible 
primarily as a result of the differing tax treatment of these acquisitions  the company recognized an income tax expense of million in and million in  as compared to an income tax expense of million in net income and net income per share years ended december  and the company recognized net income in of million as compared to million in excluding the nonrecurring charges related to the cancellation of the follow on stock offering in  net income would have increased to million compared to the net income excluding non recurring charges of million

per share in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased to million at december  from million at december  and from million at december   due primarily from operations 
cash flow generated from operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases resulted primarily from profitable operations 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of the company s investments 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of interest bearing securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
because the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments until maturity  it does not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on its securities portfolio 
the company has assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to the company s international sales operations 
the company has not hedged its translation risk on these currencies as the company has the ability to hold its foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and does not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
in february  the company prepaid the remaining balance due under a royalty agreement associated with a business combination 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cash disbursement  which amounted to million  was recorded as an intangible asset and has been amortized over the remaining term of the original royalty agreement  approximately six years 
in addition  the company amended a license agreement in september  prepaying its remaining royalty obligation by issuing a note in the amount of million payable in equal quarterly installments of  each  including imputed interest at per annum 
the company amended an additional license agreement in july  prepaying its remaining royalty obligation by issuing a non interest bearing note for  that was fully paid prior to december  for each of these license agreement amendments  the related intangible asset is being amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining lives of the patents  which are approximately years in the case of the license amended in september and approximately seven years in the case of the license amended in july in january  the company acquired rightfax for million in cash plus  shares of common stock 
the business combination was accounted for as a purchase 
approximately million of the purchase price was recognized as a nonrecurring charge in the first quarter of  representing the value of purchased  in process research and development 
the remaining intangible assets are being amortized over seven years from the date of acquisition 
as a result of the earn out and guaranteed value of the stock issued in the acquisition of rightfax  the company made payments in january and of  and  respectively  and also issued  and  additional shares of common stock 
in january  the company paid the final amounts on the earn out of  and  shares of common stock 
this earn out resulted in additional goodwill being recorded in december  and of million  million and million  respectively 
in january  the company acquired selected assets and liabilities of telcom technologies 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million in cash  plus warrants to purchase  shares of common stock exercisable at per share  which may be exercised any time prior to january  the company accounted for the business combination as a purchase and recognized a nonrecurring charge of million in the first quarter of  representing the value of the purchased  in process research and development 
in october  the company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of commercepath from forest city trading group  inc for million in cash 
in connection with the acquisition  the company also granted options to purchase  shares of common stock  at an exercise price of per share  to two of commercepath s executive officers 
the company accounted for the acquisition as a purchase and recorded a nonrecurring charge of million for the write off of purchased  in process research and development 
in addition  the company recorded million of goodwill that will be amortized over seven years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had a million unsecured revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding 
the company s line of credit expires in may and contains certain financial covenants and restrictions as to various matters 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants and restrictions 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate or its interbank offering rate plus  at the company s option 
the company invested million  million and million in equipment and leasehold improvements in the years ended december   and  respectively 
equipment purchases in such years consisted primarily of computer hardware and software 
the company expects that its current cash  cash flow from operations and available bank line of credit  will provide sufficient working capital for operations for the foreseeable future 
impact of the year issue the year issue is pervasive and complex as virtually every computer operation will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two digit year value to systems that do not properly recognize date sensitive information when the year changes to  or interact with systems or components that fail to do so  could generate erroneous data or otherwise fail to function properly  or at all 
there is speculation that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues  and the company is aware of a growing number of lawsuits against other software vendors 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation  it is uncertain whether or to what extent the company may be affected by it 
the company has developed a plan to ensure its internal systems and products are year compliant  and to mitigate its risks in the event that its vendors or other third parties with whom it has material relationships are not year compliant on a timely basis 
the company has potential exposure relating to the year issue in four areas the company s internal software and hardware systems  including non information technology systems  suppliers of hardware and software the company resells as part of its products  internally developed software the company sells  and other third parties with whom the company has material relationships 
the following information explains how the company is addressing each of these potential risk areas with respect to internal software and hardware systems  the company reviewed all its material systems to determine which systems were not year compliant 
the company is currently in the process of completing all necessary upgrades  modifications and conversions to its programs and equipment to ensure they will continue to be effective in the year  and expects to complete this process not later than june  all of such upgrades have been or are being done as part of a normal upgrade cycle and accordingly no additional costs are being incurred as a result of year issues 
the company expects that the only expense it will incur to make its internal software and hardware systems year compliant is approximately  to update an alarm system 
the company has tested and will continue to test computer components  including fax and voice cards and software it purchases from third parties  for year compliance 
the company has verified that all such components and software currently in use are year complaint 
the company  however  has identified alternate sources for critical components in the event that a supplier s business is disrupted by the advent of the year since june  all of the company s products available for sale to customers have been year compliant 
the company has offered free or reduced cost upgrades to certain purchasers of the company s products that were not year compliant when sold 
the cost of developing and providing such upgrades was approximately  the company does not intend to offer upgrades for certain of its older products 
the company has begun a process to contact third parties with which it has material relationships  including its vendors  distributors  banks  and transfer agent  to attempt to determine their preparedness with respect to year issues and to analyze the risks to the company in the event any such third parties experience significant business interruptions as a result of year noncompliance 
the company expects to complete this review process by march  the company believes that it is taking the necessary steps regarding year compliance with respect to matters within its control to ensure that the year issue will not materially impact the company 
however  the company may be materially adversely affected if important distributors or customers of the company experience significant disruptions in their systems or business due to the advent of the year in addition  the costs of the year project and the date on which the company plans to complete year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these assumptions will prove to be correct and actual results could differ materially from those expected 
the company intends to develop a contingency plan to address unexpected year issues by june  certain trends and uncertainties when used in this discussion  the words believes  anticipates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
factors which could affect the company s financial results are described below under risk factors and in item business of this annual report on form k 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrences of unanticipated events 
risk factors fluctuations in quarterly operating results  limited backlog 
the company s quarterly results of operations are subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including the timing of customer orders  changes in the company s mix of products and distribution channels  the announcement or introduction of new products by the company or its competitors  pricing pressures and general economic conditions 
for example  mix shifts between fully integrated systems and software kits result in fluctuations in gross margins because fully integrated systems generate higher revenue per unit but have lower margins due to their hardware component 
the company s results of operations also may fluctuate as a result of seasonal factors 
specifically  due to typical year end dealer sales patterns and end user buying patterns  net sales in the company s first quarter  without taking into account the effect of acquisitions  have in the past declined from the fourth quarter of the previous year 
because substantially all of the company s revenues in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter  the company has historically operated with little or no backlog 
the company establishes its expenditure levels for product development and other operating expenses based on its expected revenues  and expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  variations in the timing of sales can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations 
accordingly  the company s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
dependence on indirect distribution 
a substantial majority of the company s net sales depends on a network of independent telephone equipment dealers and computer oriented value added resellers 
there is intense competition for the attention of these independent dealers and resellers from both the company s competitors and from providers of other products normally distributed through these channels 
in addition  many of these dealers and resellers do not have the financial resources to withstand a downturn in their businesses 
the lack of active effort or interest on the part of these dealers and resellers in selling the company s products  the loss of a major dealer or reseller  or any other event or condition negatively affecting the distribution network could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or expand its network of dealers and resellers in the future or that such dealers and resellers will maintain or expand their present level of efforts to sell the company s products 
see business distribution 
risks associated with recent and future acquisitions 
since january  the company has made three strategic acquisitions 
the company s management frequently evaluates potential acquisitions of products  technologies and businesses 
acquisitions by the company may result in the diversion of management s attention from the day to day operations of the company s business and may include numerous other risks  including difficulties in the integration of operations  products and personnel 
the failure of efforts to integrate future acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  acquisitions by the company have the potential to result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  write offs of purchased  in process research and development and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
rapidly changing technology and customer needs 
the market for the company s products is subject to rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product and feature introductions 
customer needs and expectations will require the company to continue to identify  develop and market new products and features that satisfy those needs and keep pace with technological developments  including evolving industry standards and competitive offerings 
such activities will require the company to make substantial expenditures on product development 
in addition  the company has devoted significant expenditures to technologies that it anticipates will become widely adopted  such as windows nt and the internet 
there can be no assurance that new products or product enhancements developed by the company will achieve market acceptance or that the company will successfully develop new products or product enhancements on a timely basis 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments  customer requirements or evolving industry standards  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on avt s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business product development 
competition 
the computer telephony market is highly competitive and the company believes that the competitive pressures it faces are likely to intensify  particularly as new offerings based on the windows nt operating system emerge 
the company s principal competitors in the telephony oriented market for messaging systems are independent suppliers  including the octel messaging division of lucent technologies  inc  mitel corporation  active voice corporation  voysys corporation and callware technologies  inc the company s principal competitors in the call center systems market are manufacturers such as aspect telecommunications corporation and rockwell international corporation 
in addition to these independent suppliers of computer telephony solutions  private branch exchange pbx and key telephone systems manufacturers such as lucent technologies  inc  northern telecom ltd  siemens business communication systems  inc  executone information systems  inc  panasonic communications and systems co  nec america  inc and toshiba america information systems  inc 
also compete with the company by offering integrated voice messaging systems  unified messaging systems and automatic call distribution acd systems of their own design or under various oem agreements 
in the market for lan based facsimile systems  the company s principal competitors are omtool  ltd  optus software  inc  esker  sa and computer associates international  inc the company s fax server products also compete with vendors offering a range of alternative facsimile solutions  including operating systems containing facsimile and document transmission features  low end fax modem products  desktop fax software  single platform facsimile software products and customized proprietary software solutions 
in the market for production facsimile systems  the company s principal competitors are biscom  inc  esker  sa and topcall international ag 
the company believes that further acceptance of open systems architectures and the development of industry standards in the call processing market will eliminate some of the technical barriers to entry  allowing additional competitors to enter the market 
many of the company s existing competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources  as well as larger customer and installed bases and greater name recognition  than the company 
further  some of the company s competitors are able to achieve marketing advantages by bundling their call processing equipment or competitive facsimile solutions as part of their broader product offerings 
the company expects its competitors to continue to offer improved product technologies and capabilities  the availability of which could cause a significant decline in sales of the company s existing products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully or that such competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
see business competition 
declining average sales prices 
the company has experienced declining average sales prices in its basic voice messaging products as a result of competitive pressures and in the future may experience declining prices in some of its other product lines 
declining average sales prices of the company s more significant product lines could lead to a decline in the company s overall gross margins 
to offset and forestall declining average sales prices  the company believes that it must continue to develop product enhancements and new products with advanced features that are likely to generate higher margin incremental revenue 
if the company is unable to develop new products and enhancements in a timely manner or if such products do not achieve significant customer acceptance  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
see competition 
limited intellectual property protection  potential infringements 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company has received a patent in the area of unified messaging  but there can be no assurance that the claims in the patent will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors  or that the patent will provide competitive advantages for the company s products 
in addition  the company relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  nondisclosure and other agreements and technical measures to protect its proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any meaningful patent protection for its technology in the future  or that the measures taken by the company will be adequate to prevent or deter misappropriation of its technology or the development of technologies having similar performance characteristics 
the company s use of open systems architecture in the design of its products may make it easier for competitors to misappropriate or replicate the company s designs and developments 
the computer telephony software industry has historically been characterized by numerous allegations of patent infringement among competitors  and considerable related litigation 
the company has received claims of patent infringement from several parties and likely will receive additional claims in the future 
although none of these claims has led to litigation to date  the company s investigation into some of these claims has been limited by  among other things  lack of sufficient information regarding the claims 
these claims may yet result in the company s incurring substantial legal expenses and being required to obtain licenses  pay damages for infringement  or cease offering products that infringe such patents 
there can be no assurance that a license under patents or other intellectual property that the company is allegedly infringing would be available to the company on reasonable terms  if at all 
the inability of the company to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or to protect its proprietary technology could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business proprietary rights 
risks of international markets 
the company s future growth depends in part on continued expansion of its international sales  which accounted for approximately  and of net sales in the years ended december   and  respectively 
this expansion requires significant management attention and financial resources  and has resulted in a significant portion of the company s revenues being subject to the risks associated with international sales 
such risks include necessary product adaptations to local languages and telephone system technology  changes in regulatory requirements  special standards requirements  exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  and uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations 
although substantially all of the company s international sales currently are denominated in us dollars  as the company continues to expand its international operations  it expects its non dollar denominated sales and its exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions to increase 
the company does not currently engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of currency fluctuations 
because most sales are us dollar denominated  exchange rate fluctuations may make the company s products noncompetitive in certain markets 
furthermore  continued growth in international markets for the company s products depends in part on the pace at which various foreign countries are upgrading their telephone systems 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
see business distribution international distribution 
dependence on key personnel  management of growth 
the company s success depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel involved in engineering  research and development  marketing  sales  finance and administration 
in particular  the company depends to a significant degree on the efforts of its senior management team 
the company does not maintain material key person life insurance 
the competition for skilled personnel is intense and the loss of the services of key persons in any functional area could have a material adverse effect on avt s current operations and on new product development efforts 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to hire or retain sufficient qualified staff to meet its goals 
the company s success also depends on the ability of its officers and key employees to manage growth successfully and to continue to successfully develop product enhancements and new products 
the growth in the company s business has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on the company s management and operations 
to manage its growth  the company must continue to implement and improve its operational  financial and management information systems and expand  train and manage its employees 
the company s failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
dependence on suppliers 
the company uses standard computer hardware for its products 
while most components utilized by the company are readily available  voice processing circuit boards voice cards and facsimile processing circuit boards fax cards are available in quantity only from three domestic suppliers of voice cards and two domestic suppliers of fax cards 
the company has historically relied almost exclusively on dialogic corporation dialogic for its voice cards  and on dialogic and brooktrout technologies  inc brooktrout for its fax cards  primarily because of volume price discounts and the cost and effort required to develop software for an alternate voice or fax card 
if the company were to experience significant delays  interruptions or reductions in its supply of voice or fax cards  or unfavorable changes to price and delivery terms  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected 
see business manufacturing 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
factors such as new product announcements or changes in product pricing policies by the company or its competitors  quarterly fluctuations in the company s operating results  announcements of technical innovations  announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and general conditions in the computer telephony market  among other factors  may have a significant effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
the market prices of securities issued by many companies  particularly in high technology industries  experience volatility for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock
