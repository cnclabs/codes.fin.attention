item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ultratech develops  manufactures and markets photolithography equipment steppers designed to reduce the cost of manufacturing integrated circuits  thin film heads for disk drives and micromachined components 
the company supplies step and repeat systems based on one to one and reduction optical technologies to customers located throughout the united states  europe  asia pacific and japan 
these products range from low cost systems for high volume manufacturing to advanced systems for cost effective production of leading edge devices and for research and development applications 
additionally  the company manufactures and markets the ultrabeam v model electron beam pattern generation system based on vector scan technology for use in the development and production of photomasks for the ic industry 
on june   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of integrated solutions  inc  a privately held manufacturer of i line and deep ultra violet reduction lithography systems the acquisition for approximately million in cash  million in transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities 
results of operations the company s operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future depending upon a variety of factors  including substantial cyclicality in the company s target markets  various competitive factors including price based competition and competition from vendors employing other technologies  the timing and terms of significant orders  lengthy sales cycles for the company s products  concentration of credit risk  delayed shipments to customers due to customer configuration changes and other factors  acquisition activities requiring the devotion of substantial management resources  the mix of products sold  lengthy manufacturing cycles for the company s products  lengthy product development cycles for new products  the timing of new product announcements and releases by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of the company s products  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the startup of new product introductions  customer concentration  ability to volume produce systems and meet customer requirements  patterns of capital spending by customers  product discounts  changes in pricing by the company  its competitors or suppliers  political and economic instability throughout the world  in particular the asia pacific region  natural disasters  regulatory changes  and business interruptions related to the company s occupation of its facilities 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales has been and will continue to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including inventory and open purchase commitment reserve provisions  the rate of capacity utilization  the mix of products sold  nonlinearity of shipments during the quarter  increased competition in the company s targeted markets  the introduction of new products  which typically have higher manufacturing costs until manufacturing efficiencies are realized and are typically discounted more than existing products until the products gain market acceptance  the percentage of international sales  which typically have lower gross margins than domestic sales principally due to higher field service and support costs  and the implementation of subcontracting arrangements 
the company derives a substantial portion of its total net sales from sales of a relatively small number of newly manufactured systems  which typically range in price from  to million for the company s x steppers  and million to million for the company s reduction steppers 
additionally  the company s ultrabeam electron beam lithography system is anticipated to sell in a range of million to million 
as a result of these high sale prices  the timing of recognition of revenue from a single transaction has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the company s net sales and operating results 
the company s backlog at the beginning of a period typically does not include all of the sales needed to achieve the company s objectives for that period 
in addition  orders in backlog are subject to cancellation  delay  deferral or rescheduling by a customer with limited or no penalties 
consequently  the company s net sales and operating results for a period have been and will continue to be dependant upon the company obtaining orders for systems to be shipped in the same period in which the order is received 
the company s business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment during the particular period 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the company s net sales has historically been realized near the end of each quarter 
accordingly  the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments near the end of a particular quarter  due  for example  to reschedulings  delays  deferrals or cancellations by customers  additional customer configuration requirements  or to unexpected manufacturing difficulties or delays in deliveries by suppliers due to their long production lead times or otherwise  has caused and may continue to cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below the company s expectations  which has and could continue to materially adversely affect the company s operating results for such period 
in particular  the long manufacturing cycles of the company s titan and saturn steppers  and the company s newly acquired xls advanced reduction stepper and nm small field research and development reduction stepper both product lines were acquired through the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of isi  and the long lead time for lenses and other materials  could cause shipments of such products to be delayed from one quarter to the next  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter 
additionally  the company has very limited experience in the manufacture of its ultrabeam electron beam pattern generation systems 
the ultrabeam systems are extremely complex and the product has significantly long manufacturing and sales cycles  which greatly increases the likelihood of delays in shipments from one quarter to the next 
due to the high list price for these systems  shipment delays would materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter if the shipment were delayed to the following quarter 
additionally  the company may experience difficulties in assimilating the operations acquired in the acquisition 
see additional risk factors development of new product lines  expansion of operations  assimilation of acquired product lines 
the impact of these and other factors on the company s sales and operating results in any future period cannot be forecast with certainty 
the company s business has in prior years been subject to seasonality  although the company believes such seasonality has been masked in recent years by cyclical trends within the semiconductor and thin film industries 
in addition  the need for continued expenditures for research and development  capital equipment purchases and ongoing training and customer service and support worldwide  among other factors  will make it difficult for the company to reduce its significant operating expenses in a particular period if the company fails to achieve its net sales goals for the period 
additionally  the company has recently experienced manufacturing inefficiencies associated with shifts in product demand and under utilization of manufacturing capacity and the company presently anticipates that these trends will continue for at least the next few quarters 
such continuation would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company presently expects that net sales for the three month period ending march  will be lower than net sales in the comparable period in additionally  due to lack of order visibility  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain its current sales levels 
the company presently expects to recognize an operating and net loss for the quarter ending march  these losses may extend to future quarters due  in part  to the significant level of planned research  development and engineering spending  relative to anticipated sales  the current low rate of capacity utilization  and the current backlog and order levels for the company s products 
certain of the statements contained in this report may be considered forward looking statements that may involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in addition to the factors discussed herein  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following highly competitive industry  difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  international sales  development of new product lines  rapid technological change  importance of timely product introductions  importance of the company s mix and match strategy  year compliance  future acquisitions  expansion of the company s product lines  dependence on key personnel  sole or limited sources of supply  intellectual property matters  environmental regulations  effects of certain anti takeover provisions  volatility of stock price  and the other risk factors listed from time to time in the company s sec reports 
due to these and additional factors  certain statements  historical results and percentage relationships discussed below will not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
net sales vs 
net sales consist of revenue from system sales  spare parts sales  and service 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  a decrease of as compared with net sales of million for the decline  relative to  was primarily attributed to the extremely weak market conditions in the semiconductor industry and the related markets for semiconductor capital equipment 
within this market segment  the company experienced significantly lower unit system shipments across all product lines 
additionally  the company experienced lower system shipments for front end thin film head processing  micromachining applications and the production of photomasks 
for the year ended december   the company s unit system shipments decreased  relative to  while the weighted average selling price of all systems sold declined slightly 
net sales from spare parts and service increased for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily as a result of the acquisition of the product lines and related service business of isi 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  as compared with million for  a decline of 
international net sales represented of total net sales for the year ended december   as compared with for this year over year decline  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributed to decreased system sales to the asian market 
the company believes that the severe currency and equity market fluctuations that have been experienced recently by many of the asian markets has resulted  and may continue to result  in delays  deferrals and cancellations of orders of the company s products  particularly in the short term  which will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operations in foreign countries are not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally because sales contracts for the company s systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  the company has commenced direct sales operations and orders are typically denominated in japanese yen 
this may subject the company to a higher degree of risk from currency fluctuations 
the company attempts to mitigate this exposure through the use of foreign exchange contracts  however  there can be no assurance of the success of any such efforts 
international sales expose the company to a number of additional risks  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar  which  in turn  impact the relative cost of ownership of the company s products 
see additional risk factors international sales  japanese market 
the company believes that its sales have been and continue to be adversely impacted by reduced capital capacity spending levels within the semiconductor and thin film head industries 
during and  the company experienced a significant level of shipment delays and purchase order restructurings by several of its customers  and also experienced purchase order cancellations 
there can be no assurance that this trend will not continue in the future 
accordingly  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain its current or prior level of sales 
the company believes that the current strength of the us dollar  particularly in relation to the japanese yen  places the company at a competitive disadvantage 
additionally  the company has recently experienced a significant downturn in orders from customers in the thin film head industry  particularly for front end applications 
several companies within the thin film head and disk drive industries have recently announced lower than expected earnings  layoffs and restructuring or other charges 
the company believes these events indicate that the thin film head and disk drive industries have excess capacity in the near term 
this has resulted  and will continue to result  in lower sales as a result of cancellations  delays and deferrals of customer orders  which will materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the tfh industry is presently in the process of transitioning from the production of magneto resistive heads to giant magneto resistive heads 
this transition could further disrupt the flow of orders for new equipment from the tfh industry until  among other factors  customer requirements are more fully defined 
the company presently expects that net sales for the three month period ending march  will be lower than net sales in the comparable period in additionally  due to lack of order visibility  the company can give no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain its current sales levels 
because the company s net sales are subject to a number of risks  including intense competition in the capital equipment industry and the timing and market acceptance of the company s products  there can be no assurance that the company will exceed or maintain its current level of net sales for any period in the future 
additionally  the company believes that the market acceptance and volume production of its ultrabeam electron beam lithography system  xls advanced reduction stepper acquired from isi  and its titan  saturn and series families of wafer steppers  are of critical importance to its future financial results 
to the extent that these products do not achieve significant sales due to difficulties involving manufacturing or engineering  the inability to reduce the current long manufacturing cycles for such products  competition  excess capacity in the semiconductor industry  or any other reason  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
vs 
net sales for were million  a decrease of as compared with net sales of million for the decline  relative to  was primarily attributed to significantly lower unit sales of the company s model series steppers  which address the markets for scanner replacement and high volume low cost semiconductor fabrication  and lower unit sales of the company s model series steppers with machine vision system mvs  which address the market for back end processing of thin film heads  partially offset by the shipment of the company s first ultrabeam v model electron beam lithography system 
for the year ended december   the company s system shipments decreased  relative to  while the weighted average selling price of all systems sold was essentially unchanged 
net sales from spare parts and service increased for the year ended december   as compared to international sales for were million  a decline of over international sales of million in this year over year decline  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributed to decreased system sales to the asian  european and japanese markets 
during  international sales represented of total sales  as compared to in gross profit loss vs 
the company s gross loss as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december   as compared with positive gross margin of for in  the company recognized million in special charges related primarily to the write down of inventories and provisions for estimated losses associated with open purchase commitments 
these charges were primarily a result of the company s lower sales and bookings levels in  revised sales demand forecasts for and delays in the production readiness of the company s electron beam lithography system 
in addition to the special charges recognized in  the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales can be further attributed to significantly lower capacity utilization  lower product margins as a result of higher production costs  changes in product mix  a higher percentage of service and spare parts sales relative to total net sales  which typically have lower standard margins than system sales  and continued manufacturing inefficiencies as a result of non linearity of system shipments and customer cancellations  deferrals and reschedulings 
the company believes that increased competition from canon  nikon  asml and svg  among others  together with generally weak conditions in the markets the company serves  will make it difficult for the company to increase gross margin percentages in the near term 
additionally  in  the company added capacity for the anticipated volume production of several new products that are outside the company s core reflective and refractive optical technologies 
in addition to the purchase of significant levels of plant and equipment for these new products  the commencement of production of the ultrabeam electron beam lithography system has resulted and will continue to result in the purchase and retention of significant levels of inventory to support manufacturing requirements  hiring of additional production and manufacturing support personnel and the incurrence of other related manufacturing overhead costs 
see additional risk factors development of new product lines  expansion of operations  assimilation of acquired product lines 
the purchase of additional inventories will continue to result in a significantly higher risk of obsolescence  which has required and may continue to require additional inventory write offs  which negatively impact gross margins 
additionally  new products generally have lower gross margins until production and after sales efficiencies can be achieved 
should these new products  including products recently acquired in the acquisition  fail to develop or generate significant market demand  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
as a result of these and other factors  the company presently expects that gross profit as a percentage of net sales will be significantly lower for the three month period ending march   relative to levels achieved in the comparable period in vs 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales was for as compared with for this decline in gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be primarily attributed to the shift away from the company s more mature product lines  which typically have higher margins due to manufacturing efficiencies and lower required after sales support  toward the company s newer and more advanced systems  manufacturing inefficiencies caused by underutilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in the company s shipment schedule and an unusually high degree of nonlinearity of shipments during the periods  partially offset by lower required inventory reserves  lower international sales relative to total sales for the company  improved margins from spare parts and service  and increased after sales support efficiencies 
research  development and engineering expenses vs 
the company s research  development and engineering expenses  net of third party funding for certain projects  were million for  as compared with million for despite lower net sales  the company continues to invest significant resources in the development and enhancement of its ultrabeam electron beam lithography system and in the development of its verdant rapid thermal annealing laser doping systems and technologies  together with continuing expenditures for its x optical products and technologies 
additionally  in the company commenced research  development and engineering spending in the area of reduction lithography  as a direct result of the acquisition 
the company presently expects that the absolute dollar amount of research  development and engineering expenses for the quarter ending march  will be lower  relative to the comparable period in  due primarily to cost containment measures implemented by the company during the last half of see additional risk factors development of new product lines  expansion of operations  assimilation of acquired product lines 
vs 
the company s research  development and engineering expenses  net of third party funding for certain porjects  were million for  as compared with million recorded for this decrease was primarily attributed to decreased spending for the development  enhancement  manufacturing support and sales demonstration support of the company s model i stepper  model stepper  titan wafer stepper family and saturn wafer stepper family  partially offset by increased spending for the company s model mvs series steppers  development of its electron beam lithography system and development of its rapid thermal annealing laser doping technologies and systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for both and as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in in  higher general and administrative expenses related to the operations acquired in the acquisition and higher general and administrative expenses for the company s verdant and ultrabeam operations were offset by cost containment measures implemented during the year and lower expenses as are typically associated with a reduction in sales 
the company presently anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase during the quarter ending march  relative to the comparable period in  due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets and additional general and administrative expenses relative to the operations acquired in the acquisition  partially offset by cost containment measures implemented by the company during the last half of see additional risk factors development of new product lines  expansion of operations  assimilation of acquired product lines 
vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  a decrease of over the million recorded for as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in  as compared to of net sales in the dollar decrease for the year ended  relative to  reflects in large part the company s decrease in sales  service and support expenses typically associated with a decrease in sales  cost containment measures implemented during late  significantly lower required provisions for the company s profit sharing and executive incentive plans  and lower commission expense resulting from lower sales and higher direct sales relative to total net sales for the period 
acquired in process research and development on june   the company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of integrated solutions  inc  a privately held manufacturer of i line and deep ultra violet reduction lithography systems 
as a result of this acquisition  the company recognized a charge for acquired in process research and development ipr d expense of million  or per share net of tax benefits  representing products in development stage that were not considered to have reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the company s management made certain assessments with respect to the determination of all identifiable assets resulting from  or to be used in  research and development activities as of the acquisition date 
each of these activities was evaluated  by both interviews and data analysis  to determine its state of development and related fair value 
the company s review indicated that the ipr d had not reached a state of technological feasibility and the underlying technology had no alternative future use to the company in other research and development projects or otherwise 
in the case of ipr d  fair values of the corresponding technologies were determined using an income approach  which included a discounted future earnings methodology 
under this methodology  the value of the in process technology is comprised of the total present value of the anticipated net cash flows attributable to the in process project  discounted to net present value  taking into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased ipr d 
during late  the sec issued guidance on acquired in process research and development related to purchase acquisitions 
during the quarter ended december   the company recognized an adjustment of million  or per share  to reduce the ipr d expense relative to the acquisition of isi in order to reflect the final purchase price allocation 
the ipr d associated with the isi acquisition related to the development of optical and post optical lithography systems 
included were five projects i the xls isis and project  which was complete as of the acquisition date  ii the unity project  which was complete as of the acquisition date  iii the xls nm mid field and nm small field platforms  which were complete as of the acquisition date  iv the scalpel engineering feasibility project  which was complete as of the acquisition date  and v the euv stage project  which was complete as of the acquisition date 
the aforementioned completion percentages are based on an estimated weighted average of the time  cost  and complexity required to bring the projects to fruition 
the significant technological hurdles remaining to be addressed include the development of high resolution optical systems with off axis illumination  the integration of complex sub systems into production worthy tools with user friendly operator interfaces  while achieving more precise overlay  the ability to design vacuum and inert gas containment systems without unacceptable reductions in throughput  the development of caf optical elements in sizes that have never been built  and the development of an autofocus system that is four times more accurate than any system ever developed 
the company estimates that as of the acquisition date  the remaining research and development work on these projects will cost approximately million and will be completed over the next one to five years 
these projects have progressed more slowly than originally projected due to lower than anticipated staffing 
the lower staffing levels were a result of the company s actions to reduce expenses during a period of reduced revenues and earnings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the development and successful marketing of any products resulting from the completion of these projects 
a failure to successfully develop and market such products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the first quarter of  the company completed the acquisition of the assets of lepton inc  a developer of electron beam lithography systems 
as a result of this acquisition  the company recognized a charge for technology acquired for a research and development project of million  or per share  net of related income tax benefits 
special charge relating to termination of japan distributor in december  the company terminated its relationship with its japan distributor  innotech corporation 
this resulted in a special charge of million  or per share  in the quarter ended december   net of related income tax benefits  primarily related to termination fees negotiated between the company and innotech 
special charges due primarily to the continued downturn in the thin film head and semiconductor industries  the company realized significantly lower sales and bookings levels during as a result  the company significantly reduced its production demand forecast for and implemented various cost containment measures beginning in the third quarter of during the third and fourth quarters of  the company recognized special charges in the amount of million and million  respectively  for the write down of excess inventories and provisions for estimated losses on open purchase commitments 
these charges are included in cost of sales 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company recognized charges in the amount of million and million  respectively  related to collection uncertainty of certain accounts and leases receivable and provisions for sales returns and allowances 
additionally  during the third quarter of  the company recognized charges of million as a result of the reduction in the company s workforce and the consolidation of certain of its facilities 
these charges have been included in operating expenses for interest and other income  net other income  net  which consists primarily of interest income  was million for as compared with million for and million for income taxes benefit income taxes benefit represented  and of income loss before income taxes for  and  respectively 
the decline in the tax rate for  relative to  is primarily a result of not recognizing a benefit for the net operating loss carryforward and certain deferred tax asset reserves recognized during the year 
the decrease in the tax rate for  relative to  is primarily a result of benefits associated with the company s research and development efforts together with higher tax exempt income  relative to total income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared with million provided by operating activities during the comparable period in positive cash flows from operating activities during were primarily attributed to a reduction in accounts and leases receivable of million  a reduction in inventories of million and total non cash charges to income of million  partially offset by the net loss of million for the year ended december  and a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the significant dollar decrease in accounts receivable was partially the result of the sale of accounts receivable to third party financial institutions 
the company sells certain of its accounts and leases receivable in order to mitigate its credit risk and to enhance cash flow 
sales of accounts receivable typically preceed final customer acceptance of the system 
among other terms and conditions  the agreements include provisions that require the company to repurchase receivables if certain conditions are present including  but not limited to  disputes with the customer regarding suitability of the product  and from time to time the company has repurchased certain accounts receivable in accordance with these terms 
at december   approximately million of sold accounts receivable and million of sold leases receivable were outstanding to third party financial institutions 
the company presently anticipates that the current trend of non linear shipments and extended customer payment cycles will continue for some time 
accordingly  the company expects that accounts receivable will remain at unusually high levels for at least the next several quarters 
such trends  should they continue  would expose the company to numerous risks  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may continue to attempt to mitigate the impact of extended payment terms by selling up to a substantial portion of its accounts receivable in the future 
there can be no assurance that this financing will be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
the company believes that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of its systems  particularly newer products  the company s inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
additionally  in  the company invested million in plant and equipment as a result of the anticipated volume production of its electron beam lithography system  and million in plant and equipment as a result of the anticipated introduction of its rapid thermal annealing laser doping system 
as of december   the company had approximately million of inventories and million of net long lived assets related to these new product lines 
as such  these assets may be subject to a greater risk of impairment  which could materially adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
during the year ended december   the company used million of cash in its investing activities  as cash investments of million for capital expenditures and million for the acquisition were partially offset by a net million in cash generated by the company s investment activities 
the significant level of capital asset additions during was primarily attributed to facilities expansions for the manufacture and sales demonstration support of the company s electron beam lithography and rapid thermal annealing laser doping systems  together with fixed assets acquired from isi 
as a result of these capital expenditures and the acquisition of isi  the company s depreciation and amortization costs have increased significantly and may negatively impact the company s results of operations in the event of a continued downturn in the company s business cycles 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was million  principally as a result of million generated from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and the company s employee stock purchase plan and million in additional borrowings under the company s existing lines of credit 
at december   the company had working capital of million 
the company s principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the development and manufacture of new lithography systems and enhancements are highly capital intensive 
in order to be competitive  the company must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  sales  service  training and support capabilities  investments in systems  procedures and controls  expansion of operations and research and development  among many other items 
the company expects that anticipated cash flow from operations  its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and funds available under its lines of credit will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address its working capital or capital equipment needs 
additionally  the company may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
future acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect any company profitability 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited direct prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in the event the company acquires product lines  technologies or businesses which do not complement the company s business  or which otherwise do not enhance the company s sales or operating results  the company may incur substantial write offs and higher recurring operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that any such acquisition does occur  there can be no assurance as to the effect thereof on the company s business or operating results 
additionally  the company is experiencing continued interest in its equipment leasing program and this may result in the further formation of significant long term receivables  which  in turn  would require the use of substantial amounts of working capital 
the formation of significant long term receivables and the granting of extended customer payment terms exposes the company to additional risks  including potentially higher customer concentration and higher potential operating expenses relating to customer defaults 
during the three month periods ended september  and december   the company took significant reserves against potentially non performing leases receivable 
if defaults on additional lease receivables were to occur  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
to the extent that the company s financial resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  additional funds will be required 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
year readiness disclosure many currently installed computer systems and software products are coded to accept only two digit entries in the attached date code field 
beginning in the year  these date code fields will need to accept four digit entries to distinguish st century dates from th century dates 
as a result  in less than one year  computer systems and or software used by many companies may need to be upgraded to comply with such year yk requirements 
the company has provided an assessment  below  of the state of readiness of its information and non information technology systems  together with a summary of the status of related testing  remediation and implementation 
the company presently estimates that the total cost for the entire yk project will approximate one million dollars and that the remaining project cost is approximately  the company plans to fund these remaining costs from cash generated by operations or from cash and short term investments on hand 
however additional requirements may be identified and unscheduled costs may be incurred as the project proceeds 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company  or its vendors  will be able to timely and cost effectively update its products to avoid yk date errors  and this may result in material costs to the company  including costs associated with detecting and fixing such errors and costs incurred in litigation due to any such errors 
many commentators have predicted that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of year compliance issues and the company is aware of several such suits that are currently pending 
because of the unprecedented nature of such litigation and the highly technical nature of the company s products  there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by claims related to yk compliance 
although the company presently believes that it has or will timely make required changes to the software in its products  it believes that the most likely worst case scenario is from unknown impacts to its customers manufacturing processes  which could potentially adversely impact product yields and throughput 
in addition to possible litigation  the company could incur substantially higher product returns and warranty related expenses  either of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the company s customers may be required to devote substantial financial resources to their own internal yk audit and compliance 
this may result in fewer financial resources available to purchase the company s products  fewer system sales by the company  and could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that its own yk efforts have resulted  and will continue to result in  a diversion of management and financial resources  which has further resulted in the delay or deferral of various information technology and engineering projects 
information technology systems the company has commenced  for all of its information systems  a yk conversion project to address necessary code changes  testing  and implementation and contingency plans 
the company has completed testing and verification of its primary business information system and has identified the significant potential risks associated with yk 
the company believes it has remedied these potential errors and that it has provided for contingency plans to further minimize risks to its business system associated with yk 
although the company is not aware of any material operational issues or costs associated with preparing its internal systems for yk  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience serious unanticipated negative consequences and or material costs caused by undetected errors or defects in technology used in its internal operating systems  which are composed primarily of third party software and hardware technology 
additionally  although the company has made inquiries of its key information technology vendors  and is in the process of collecting and reviewing survey responses  the company believes it will not be able to obtain adequate assurances from all its key vendors 
even where assurances are received from third parties  there remains a risk that failure of systems and products of other companies on which the company relies could have a material adverse affect on the company 
accordingly the company continues to assess the degree of risk to the company and is preparing contingency plans 
the company is presently working to minimize risk from vendors through understanding and implementing necessary remediation and or contingency plans 
there can be no assurance that such contingency plans will be adequate and that the company will not incur significant additional costs or business interruptions in connection with such transition  either of which could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
non information technology systems the company has commenced  for all of its key vendors  physical plant and software contained in the products it sells  a yk conversion project to address necessary remediation  testing  implementation and contingency plans 
the company believes it has identified the required changes for its products hardware and software components to attain yk readiness and is currently completing product modifications and working with customers to assist in understanding these requirements 
the company presently expects such modifications to be made on a timely basis 
the company has obligations to provide these modifications to customers with systems under warranty or currently under service contract 
the company presently expects that these modifications will be installed on a timely basis 
in addressing customer inquiries regarding the company s yk readiness and in making inquiries of the company s vendors  the company has adopted the sematech process for investigating and responding to the yk subject 
this process includes a survey form  a readiness matrix and a testing scenario 
although the company has made inquiries of its key physical plant and materials vendors in order to assess their state of readiness  and is in the process of collecting and reviewing survey responses  the company believes it will not be able to obtain adequate assurances from all its key vendors 
even where assurances are received from third parties  there remains a risk that failure of systems and products of other companies on which the company relies could have a material adverse affect on the company 
accordingly the company continues to assess the degree of risk to the company and is preparing contingency plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk  for changes in interest rates  relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio  which consisted primarily of fixed interest rate instruments as of december  the company maintains a strict investment policy  which is designed to ensure the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting market risk and the risk of default 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held by the company at december  these instruments are comprised of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted long term investments 
these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading

the company mitigates default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and maintains a prudent amount of diversification 
to date  the company has not experienced liquidity problems with its portfolio 
although comparative information at december  is not presented  the company has not materially altered its investment objectives or criteria and believes that  although the composition of the company s portfolio has changed  the portfolio s sensitivity to changes in interest rates would have been materially the same as presented above 
the company s operations in foreign countries are not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally due to the limited scope of those operations and because sales contracts for the company s systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  the company has commenced direct sales operations and orders are typically denominated in japanese yen 
this may subject the company to a higher degree of risk from currency fluctuations 
the company attempts to mitigate this exposure through the use of foreign exchange contracts 
the realized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and offset against realized and unrealized gains and losses from the settlement of the related yen denominated receivables 
at december  there were no outstanding foreign currency contracts
