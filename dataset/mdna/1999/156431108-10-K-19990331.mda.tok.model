item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  appearing in item overview the company is an integrated manufacturer of primary aluminum and a broad range of value added and specialized sheet and plate products 
the company s net sales are derived from the sale of primary aluminum and aluminum sheet and plate products and from the tolling of primary aluminum and scrap into sheet and plate products 
the company sells sheet and plate products either directly to customers  in which case revenues and cost of goods sold include metal costs  or as a toll  in which case the customer provides the metal and the company s revenues and cost of goods sold do not include metal costs 
the aluminum industry is highly cyclical and the market price of primary aluminum which trades as a commodity is determined by worldwide supply and demand conditions  and as such  is highly volatile 
for example  the cash price for primary aluminum traded on the lme averaged  and per pound for the years   and  respectively 
in turn  prices of aluminum sheet and plate products have reflected this volatility  as well as fluctuations attributable to general and industry specific economic conditions  which affect the company s volume and mix of sheet and plate products sold 
the company s results of operations depend to a large degree on the market prices of primary aluminum and its flat rolled sheet and plate products 
any adverse changes in the conditions that affect the market price of primary aluminum or the market prices of the company s sheet and plate products could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
of the approximately million pounds of primary aluminum produced at century of west virginia s reduction facility in  the company utilized approximately million pounds for its rolling operations  with the balance sold primarily to the glencore group and third parties at market prices 
the company s interest in the mt

the major raw materials and energy sources used by the company in its production process are alumina  aluminum scrap  coal tar pitch  petroleum coke  aluminum fluoride and electricity 
the market price of alumina has been volatile from time to time 
on july   century entered into a long term fixed price alumina supply contract with alcoa llc and alcoa of australia 
pursuant to the supply agreement  since january   century has paid a fixed price for alumina  subject to fixed annual price increases of approximately through although the company produces the primary aluminum metal required by its rolling operations  it attempts to use as much aluminum scrap as possible internally as well as through purchases in the open market to meet the total requirements of its rolling operations 
the market price for aluminum scrap closely follows the price of primary aluminum and has been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations 
the company uses significant amounts of electricity in the aluminum reduction process 
to fulfill its power requirements at the century of west virginia facility  prior to july   the company purchased electricity from ohio power at a price based principally upon ohio power s costs of production 
the company and the same public utility signed a power supply agreement  covering the period from july  through july  under this agreement  the company pays a fixed price for electricity used 
since  under the terms of the agreement  the power rate is fixed  the company s margins could be adversely affected if aluminum prices decrease

century has not had to defer any of its information technology projects due to its year compliance efforts 
the company s inventory of potentially affected systems both information technology and non information technology is complete 
major systems have been determined to be year compliant 
each of the company s business units has a year compliance plan in place  establishing time tables  staff and responsibilities 
each of the company s business units conducted its own inventory  identified its mission critical systems and is upgrading or replacing those systems that were not year compliant 
each business unit reports the results of its year program quarterly to a corporate steering committee 
this central coordination allows the company to evaluate and  if necessary  remedy  common applications or software only once  reducing costs 
the company expects to complete all software and hardware testing and implementation by the end of the second quarter of the company expects to formulate its year contingency plan at the end of the second quarter of  once the company has completed its final remediation testing and implementation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices century produces primary aluminum products and manufactures aluminum sheet and plate products 
the company s earnings are exposed to aluminum price fluctuations 
the company manages this risk through the issuance of fixed price commitments and financial instruments 
the company does not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
although the company has not materially participated in the purchase of call options  in cases where century sells forward primary aluminum  it may purchase call options to preserve the benefit from price increases significantly above forward sales prices 
in addition  it may purchase put options to protect itself from price decreases 
the company had fixed price commitments to sell million pounds of primary  scrap aluminum and sheet and plate products at december  the company had fixed price commitments to purchase million pounds of aluminum and alloy raw materials at december  in addition  the company has a long term supply agreement for million pounds of alumina annually  whereby  the company will pay a fixed price for alumina with annual price increases of approximately through at december   the company had entered into million pounds of forward primary aluminum purchase contracts  primarily with the glencore group  to mitigate the risk of commodity price fluctuations inherent in a portion of its anticipated future sales of aluminum sheet and plate products

these contracts will be settled in cash at various dates in based on market prices at december   these financial instruments could be settled by the company receiving approximately million 
the actual settlement will be based on market prices at the respective settlement dates 
a hypothetical per pound increase in the market price of primary aluminum is estimated to have an unfavorable impact of million on net income in as a result of the forward primary aluminum purchase and sale contracts entered into by the company at december  the effect of the hypothetical change of per pound was calculated using a parallel shift in the december  forward price curve for primary aluminum 
the price curve takes into account the time value of money  as well as future expectations regarding the price of primary aluminum 
actual changes in commodity prices may differ from hypothetical changes 
this quantification of the company s exposure to the commodity price of aluminum is necessarily limited  as it does not take into consideration the company s inventory or fixed price commitments  or the offsetting impact upon the purchase price of raw materials and sales price of aluminum products 
all gains and losses from forward contract activity are reported separately in the statements of operations 
unrealized gains or losses on the forward primary aluminum contracts  realized gains or losses from the cash settlement of the forward primary aluminum contracts  and reversals of prior period unrealized losses are reported as either gains or losses on forward contracts 
century monitors its overall position  and its metals risk management activities are subject to the management  control and direction of senior management 
these activities are regularly reported to the board of directors of century 
interest rates the company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to its variable rate revolving term debt of million at december  the primary exposure is movement in the us treasury rates and libor 
a hypothetical increase in these interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
actual changes in interest rates may differ from hypothetical changes 
this analysis does not take into effect other changes that might occur in the economic environment due to such changes in short term interest rates
