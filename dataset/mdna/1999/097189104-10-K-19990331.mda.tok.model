year the year yk readiness issue is the result of information technology it system programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the application year 
any of the company s it systems that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using for the applicable year as the year and not the year this could result in miscalculations  system failures  or other business disruptions 
the company is implementing a plan which addresses yk technology compliance for its it and non it systems 
the plan includes a review of the company s suppliers and customers to assure that they are working toward yk compliance 
the company uses it systems in various aspects of its business  including manufacturing  research and development  distribution and many administrative functions 
a significant amount of the company s software and systems may need to be updated  modified or replaced to address the yk readiness issue 
in that regard  the company has retained consultants to evaluate the effect of appropriately modifying the company s it systems and the company has projects underway to address the yk readiness of its it systems and the it systems of material third parties 
the company has prioritized its it systems into three categories critical  necessary or other 
the company currently expects that critical and necessary systems  the loss or failure of which could result in a serious disruption of revenue or serious processing delay  respectively  will be yk complaint by the third quarter of  with modifications to the existing software and or conversions to new software 
the company currently expects that the remainder of the company s it systems will be yk compliant within such timeframe or shortly thereafter 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company s critical  necessary and other it systems will become yk compliant by the projected time 
the company s non it systems include embedded technology such as microcontrollers included in production equipment  office equipment  environmental control equipment and time locks 
all of the company s non it systems are already yk ready except for some products that were discontinued by the company 
with respect to such products  the company is evaluating its alternatives and expects this review to be completed by the second quarter of next fiscal year 
material third party vendors have been contacted and asked to attest to yk compliance 
alternate vendors will be evaluated as potential replacements for non compliant or non responsive vendors 
currently  management estimates that the company will expend up to  including capital lease obligations on system upgrade and replacement projects  which upgrades and replacements will  among other things  make the company s it systems yk compliant 
most of these upgrades  and the costs relating thereto  will be made in yk remediation programs and ongoing systems upgrade and replacement projects are funded through the company s operations 
if it systems affected by the yk were not addressed as the company is doing  they could conceivably cause technological failures throughout the company  disrupting normal business operations 
these risks are similar to those faced by other manufacturing companies 
management does not believe that the company s business will be materially affected by yk readiness issues 
nevertheless  the company expects to have contingency plans that address the most reasonably likely worst case yk scenarios 
in the event that the company can not complete its system upgrade and replacement projects in a timely manner  the company will use a software patch to make its it systems yk compliant 
if non it systems affected by the yk were not addressed as the company is doing  they could disrupt normal business operations 
these theoretical consequences are generally shared with other manufacturing companies 
nevertheless  the company expects to have contingency plans that address the most reasonably likely worst case yk scenarios 
the company has contacted its key suppliers and vendors to assess the potential impact on the company s operations if those third parties fail to become yk compliant in a timely manner 
while certain of the company s suppliers and vendors have provided the company with written certification that the it systems used by such third parties will be yk compliant prior to the year  the company is currently in the process of identifying the potential risks of external business relationships with those third parties who have not certified to the company as to the status of their yk compliance 
action steps and contingency plans related to significant third party relationships are expected to be completed by mid to late economic environment asia bogen relies principally upon an established network of suppliers and subcontractors primarily located in the republic of south korea  and to a lesser extent in the asia pacific region  and in the united states 
during and  the affects of the adverse economic conditions in the republic of south korea and other countries in the asia pacific region included a national liquidity crisis  significant depreciation in the value of the won  high interest rates and a general reduction in spending throughout the region 
the company is currently monitoring this situation closely and will take all measures within its control to ensure that production of the company s products will continue without interruption 
should production by the company s suppliers be curtailed  the company believes suitable suppliers in other parts of the world will be available to satisfy its production requirements 
however  there can be no assurances that events beyond the company s control will not disrupt production or that suitable alternative sources of production can be identified on a timely basis  thereby resulting in material adverse effects on the company s results of operations
