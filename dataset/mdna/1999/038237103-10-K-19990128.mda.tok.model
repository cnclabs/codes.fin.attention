item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview applied signal technology  inc designs  develops  and manufactures signal processing equipment to collect and process a wide range of telecommunication signals for reconnaissance and industrial application 
signal reconnaissance equipment is used for the monitoring of foreign telecommunications  predominantly by the united states government and allied foreign governments 
industrial applications include spectrum monitoring equipment for commercial communication satellite systems  and data intrusion detection equipment for data network protection 
signal reconnaissance systems are composed of collection equipment and processing equipment 
signal collection equipment consist of sophisticated receivers that can scan the radio frequency rf spectrum cellular telephone  microwave  ship to shore  military transmissions  etc 
to collect certain signals from potentially thousands of signals within the rf spectrum 
process equipment  using sophisticated software and hardware  evaluates the characteristics of collected signals and selects those signals likely to contain relevant information 
spectrum monitoring equipment evaluate a communication satellite s frequency spectrum usage to detect any misuse that could cause substandard service 
data intrusion detection equipment monitor commercial data networks to detect unauthorized system entry for the purpose of altering or pirating data 
since inception  the company has focused its efforts primarily on processing equipment  but also provides specialized collection equipment  as well as complete signal processing systems 
the company s business involves risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those contained in this report in business considerations and certain factors that may affect future results of operations and or stock prices 
the company s revenues are primarily generated from sales of its products and services to two agencies of the united states government 
the two agencies accounted for and  respectively  of revenues for fiscal for fiscal  the two agencies accounted for and  respectively  of revenues and for fiscal  the percentages of revenues derived from these two agencies were and  respectively 
the company s revenues are derived from either fixed price contracts  which provide that the company perform a contract for a fixed price and assume the risk of any cost overruns or cost plus reimbursement contracts  which provide that the company receive the direct and indirect costs of performance plus a negotiated profit 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  and approximately of the company s revenues were derived from cost plus reimbursement contracts 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  and approximately of the company s revenues were derived from cost plus reimbursement contracts 
in fiscal  approximately of the company s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts  and approximately of the company s revenues were derived from cost plus reimbursement contracts 
under fixed price contracts  unexpected increases in the cost to develop or manufacture a product  whether due to inaccurate estimates in the bidding process  unanticipated increases in material costs  inefficiencies or other factors  are borne by the company  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in accounting for cost plus reimbursement type contracts  all costs are charged to operations as incurred including allowable administrative expenses  and revenues are recognized based on costs incurred plus estimated fee rates at the date of evaluation 
in accounting for fixed price type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percent completion method which is substantially the same as that used for cost type contracts described above 
all costs are charged to operations including allowable administrative expenses as incurred  and revenues are recognized based on estimated costs and profits at completion on a contract by contract basis 
losses on any individual contracts are provided for at the time they become known

operating results fiscal years comparison the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues from contracts and  at the end of each period indicated  the company s backlog year ended october  revenues from contracts operating expenses contract costs research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net income before provision for income provision for income taxes net income backlog thousands of dollars    revenues revenues from contracts increased by from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal revenues increased by from approximately  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal the revenue increase in fiscal is due in part to increased contract activity experienced in the military marketplace and  in part  due to an increasing demand from the intelligence agencies for development contracts 
the revenue increase in fiscal over the revenue reported in fiscal was due in part to the introduction of new products and services  as well as an increase in average fees recorded for production contracts 
the following table identifies the source of the company s revenues for fiscal years  and by major market fy fy fy intelligence agencies military foreign commercial backlog the company s backlog  which consists of anticipated revenues from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts excluding unexercised options  was approximately  at the end of fiscal this represents an approximate decrease of from the prior year s ending backlog of approximately  the backlog for fiscal year was nominally greater than the backlog of approximately  for fiscal year regarding the decrease in backlog experienced during fiscal  management believes the decrease in backlog between fiscal and fiscal is due in part to a delay in specific contract awards from the united states government and  in part  due to a reduced number of awards for the company s off the shelf products 
although it is impossible to determine the precise cause of the order slowdown  management believes it is caused in part by a diversion of the government s focus to the year problem and in part  caused by a preponderance of product sales to a certain intelligence office during fiscal year who  consequently  purchased less in fiscal year while management believes that the demand for global intelligence and tactical communications systems should continue  there can be no assurances that the reduced order flow experienced during fiscal will not have an impact on future revenues 
contract costs contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts  such as labor  materials and manufacturing overhead costs 
contract costs  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year as a percentage of revenues  contract costs for fiscal year were lower than contract costs of of revenues for fiscal year the continued decrease in contract costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is in part attributable to higher contract fees and  in part due to the lower manufacturing overhead applied to contracts during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in contract costs as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  is attributable to economies of scale related to a higher percentage of production contracts in fiscal  and fewer products being transitioned from development stage to production stage in fiscal research and development expenses company directed investment in research and development consists of expenditures recoverable from customers through the company s billing rates and expenditures funded by the company from earnings 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
research and development spending grew by approximately  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and  correspondingly  grew as a percentage of revenues in fiscal when compared to the percentage of revenue in fiscal this increase in research and development spending during fiscal is due to management s decision to increase research and development activities for the benefit of future business 
although r d spending grew approximately  to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal  research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal when compared to fiscal the decrease in research and development spending as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was attributable to the demands of contract work which resulted in limited availability of staff to work on research and development contracts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include administrative salaries  costs related to the company s marketing and proposal activities  and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses were approximately  or of revenues in fiscal compared to approximately  or of revenues in fiscal and approximately  or of reveunes in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal is primarily attributable to the higher profit recognized on contracts during fiscal compared to fiscal the higher general and administrative expenses in fiscal years and reflect an increase in bid and proposal activity experienced during the fiscal years  as well as  an increase in marketing costs 
in recent years  management has continued to emphasize the marketing component of g a in an effort to generate revenues in future periods 
interest income expense net net interest income expense for fiscal increased approximately  from approximately  net interest income in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal net interest income in fiscal increased approximately  over net interest income in fiscal of approximately  the increase in interest income during fiscal is due primarily to investing higher cash balances generated from operations as well as from additional efforts expended to collect outstanding receivable balances 
the higher interest income received in fiscal was primarily due to funds received on short term investments because of cash generated from higher profit margins and due to the interest expense incurred during fiscal for the company s higher average outstanding line of credit balances throughout fiscal provision for income taxes income taxes as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes have been provided for at a combined federal and state rate of for fiscal versus for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate is lower than the combined federal and state statutory income tax rates primarily due to the benefit derived from federal and state income tax credits 
the increases in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal are primarily a result of the increases in federal and state tax liabilities as a result of the lower impact of federal and state tax credits on increased profitability

management expects these fluctuations to continue into the future 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity has been the cash flow generated from operations  as well as the issuance of common stock through its employee stock plans 
the company has a  unsecured  revolving line of credit for short term cash requirements bearing interest at the bank s reference rate as of october

net cash from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities has varied significantly from year to year 
for fiscal years  and  cash provided by operating activities was approximately   and  million  respectively 
the year to year variances are primarily the result of changes in net income  changes in accounts receivable  changes in the level of accrued liabilities and the change in inventories held by the company 
during fiscal net income increases to approximately  during fiscal  net income increased to approximately  from approximately  in fiscal the improvement in net income for fiscal is primarily due to an increase in the average gross margin profitability recorded on contracts during the year  and in part to a reduction in general and administrative expenses recorded as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 
during fiscal  accounts receivable decreased by approximately  when compared to an increase of approximately  for fiscal the cash generated by accounts receivable in fiscal is due  in part to greater collection efforts and  in part  due to collections received from a one time billing modification authorized by the us government in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increased level of accounts receivable during fiscal was primarily due to greater contract activity  and in part to certain limitations and terms stipulated in certain engineering and production contracts 
cash generated by the increased levels of liabilities for fiscal approximated  and was primarily due to increased tax liabilities associated with higher profit margins 
cash generated by the increased levels of accrued liabilities for fiscal was approximately  and was primarily due to the year end accrual for payroll and employee benefits 
cash used by the increased levels of inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets of approximately  in fiscal is primarily due to the increase in work in progress for engineering and production contracts and  in part  due to the increase in prepaid income taxes related to higher profits 
cash used by the increased levels of inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets in fiscal was primarily due to the purchase of parts required for future production  as well as for purchases for anticipated future contract awards 
net cash from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was approximately  for fiscal compared to approximately  during fiscal and approximately  in fiscal the use of cash for investing activities for the last three fiscal years was primarily for additions to property and equipment 
the company s capital investment continues to be driven by an increase in the number of new employees and by the level of development type contracts that have required test and computing equipment 
cash provided by investing activities throughout fiscal for the purchase and maturity of short term investments  primarily in us government treasuries  was approximately  other cash provided by investing activities during fiscal included the maturity of approximately  of the company s short term investments in us government treasuries 
net cash from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was approximately  during fiscal compared to approximately  provided by investing activities during fiscal and approximately  provided by investing activities during fiscal during fiscal  the  used in financing activities is attributable to the issuance of approximately  of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and stock option plan offset by approximately  of common stock repurchases initiated and completed under the company s buyback program 
the  and  provided by financing activities during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were predominately due to the issuance of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
the company believes that the funds generated from operations  existing working capital  and amounts available under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for at least the next months
