year the company relies on a diverse assortment of computer hardware and software  the integrated operation of which is essential to the successful implementation of the company s operations 
the company  in  began a comprehensive review of its information technology systems and other systems and equipment and has developed a year implementation program 
the implementation program has been reviewed by the company s board of directors 
full compliance and testing is scheduled to be completed by mid the entire implementation program is divided into three broad systems  the corporate systems  the store systems and the foodservice systems and the program has two phases  the impact analysis phase and the modification or replacement phase 
the impact analysis phase for the corporate systems  includes the identification of date sensitive computer codes within the systems  has been completed 
the modification or replacement phase for the corporate systems is substantially complete with one remaining subsystem to be completed by the end of first quarter the impact analysis phase for the store systems has been completed and the modification or replacement phase is expected to be completed by mid the impact analysis phase for the foodservice systems also has been completed  and the modification or replacement phase is on schedule to be completed by the end of the second quarter of except for the cost of replacement systems  the company will expense  as incurred  the cost of the year program

the company estimates the total incremental cost of the year program will not exceed million 
as of the end of fiscal year  the company had incurred approximately million in costs with respect to the year program 
as part of the year project  the company has identified relationships with third parties  including vendors  suppliers  and service providers  which the company believes are critical to its business operations 
the company is in the process of communicating with these third parties through questionnaires  letters and interviews in an effort to determine the extent to which they are addressing their year issues 
the company will continue to communicate with  assess and monitor the progress of these third parties in resolving year issues 
the company anticipates minimal disruptions in its operations as a result of system failures related to year issues 
if the company or a key third party experiences a systems failure due to the century change  the company believes the most significant adverse impact would be its inability to communicate with suppliers concerning timely delivery of inventory 
other possible consequences include  but are not limited to  loss of communications with stores  loss of electric power  and an inability to process customer transactions or otherwise engage in similar normal business activities 
the company cannot assure that there will not be an adverse impact on the company if third parties do not appropriately address their year issues in a timely manner 
although the company does not believe the actual impact of these failures will be material  the company is currently developing a contingency plan for possible year issues including the delivery of inventory and processing of customer transactions 
the company will continue to develop these plans based on its internal testing results  tests with third parties and its assessment of other outside risks 
the company will continually refine its contingency plan throughout as additional information becomes available 
seasonality historically  the company s sales have followed a seasonal pattern 
generally  third and fourth quarter sales are greater than those of the first and second quarter  due to strong demand from foodservice customers in the summer and winter holiday periods 
third quarter sales are also high because the third quarter includes four four week periods  whereas the other quarters include three four week periods 
sales distribution by quarter in was in the first quarter  in the second  in the third  and in the fourth 
inflation the company s primary costs  merchandise and labor  are affected by a number of factors that are beyond the company s control 
these factors include the price of merchandise  the competitive climate  and the general and regional economic conditions 
as is typical in the food industry  the company has generally been able to maintain margins by adjusting its selling prices 
but competitive conditions may  from time to time  render it unable to do so while maintaining or increasing its market share 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s objective of financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s earnings and cash flows 
interest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate collar contracts 
these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing risk of credit loss 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of the company s interest rate collars 
the following analysis presents the sensitivity to the earnings of the company if these changes occurred at january  the range of changes chosen for this analysis reflects the company s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact the company s business as a result of these changes in interest 
interest rate sensitivity analysis at january   the company had debt  excluding capital leases  totaling million and interest rate collar contracts with a notional value of million 
the interest rate collar contracts limit libor fluctuations to interest rate ranges from to 
as of january   the libor rate was 
at january   the company had million of variable rate debt and million of fixed rate debt 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels  the earnings and cash flow impact of a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately million 
the earnings and cash flow impact of a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would be approximately million  holding other variables constant 
credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable 
the company provides credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the number of customers comprising the company s customer base 
the company currently believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks
