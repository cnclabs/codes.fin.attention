manufactured housing operating revenue increased million to million 
this increase was primarily with contract and other large manufactured housing customers that the company services 
partially offsetting this growth was the loss of accounts in the second half of the year primarily in the south

additionally  the delivery of class eight vehicles or decking operating revenues grew four times to million in partially offsetting this growth was a decrease in operating revenues from the delivery of travel trailers 
specialized outsourcing services ebitda decreased million primarily due to increased recruiting  dispatch  and other administrative costs 
insurance finance the company s insurance finance segment provides insurance and financing services to the company s drivers and independent owner operators 
this segment also acts as a cost center whereby all bodily injury  property damage and cargo loss costs are captured 
the company in continued to be penalized by increasing claim costs 
claim costs in  as a percent of operating revenue  increased to from in this continuing negative trend offsets the benefits of lower insurance expense and the transfer of more losses to the insurers in the increase in claims costs was primarily responsible for the increased loss of the insurance finance segment

the first item related to a change in accounting that amounted to million  the second item was a special credit of million 
the change in accounting was to account for certain components of driver pay on an accrual rather than a cash basis 
the special credit related primarily to the gain on the sale of truckaway assets in excess of reserves established in the prior year 
ebitda before the net special charge was million 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses in related to the discontinuance of the truckaway operation was partially offset by increased amortization from the transit acquisition

specialized outsourcing services the discontinuance of the truckaway operation in may of and a decrease in driver outsourcing operating revenues resulted in the decline of million in specialized outsourcing services operating revenues in partially offsetting was an increase in trailer operating revenues 
this increase was attributed to a renewed focus on the large trailer delivery business and the transit acquisition  which brought new travel trailer operating revenues 
decreases in relocation of rental trucks  principally due to management s decision to de emphasize participation in this cyclical industry segment and competitive pressures  was a significant factor  contributing to the decline in specialized outsourcing services driver outsourcing operating revenues 
additionally  recreational vehicles operating revenues decreased through a combination of reduced production from a major customer and other competitive issues 
operating revenues from the delivery of new commercial vehicles declined slightly in primarily due to the realignment of our customer base in order to better position this product line for greater profitability

liquidity and capital resources operating activities generated million of cash in compared with a use of cash of million in net income plus depreciation and amortization  a decrease in trade accounts receivable and an increase in claims liabilities were partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes and an increase in other accounts receivables 
trade accounts receivable decreased million due to accelerated collections 
days sales outstanding decreased from days at december   to days at december  as previously discussed  bodily injury  property damage and cargo claims experience continued to penalize operations in the increase in other accounts receivable is primarily refund amounts due from the primary insurance provider 
the increase in accrued claims payable of million represents the self insured portion of these claims 
the company accrues its self insurance liability using a case reserve method based upon claims incurred and estimates of unasserted and unsettled claims 
these liabilities have not been discounted 
the company in april  renegotiated its insurance for these events reducing the deductibles to  and including a stop loss provision for cargo losses 
capital expenditures and business acquisitions were million in similarly  the capital expenditure plan approximates million  which will be primarily funded through internally generated funds 
net cash used in financing activities increased to million in cash was used for payments on term and promissory notes  pay off of revolving credit notes  dividends  and the purchase of company stock 
the company had no outstanding balance under its revolving credit facility at december   and borrowing available for revolving credit of million 
on january   the company entered into a new million revolving credit facility new credit facility with the transportation division of bankboston 
this new credit facility is for two years  subject to renewal  and better sized to the company s requirements 
it is the current policy of the company to pay annual class a common stock dividends totaling 
per share and class b common stock dividends totaling 
per share 
payment of any future dividends will be dependent upon  among other things  earnings  financing agreement covenants  future growth plans  legal restrictions  and the financial condition of the company 
the company commenced a tender offer on february   at which time it announced its intention to purchase shares of its class a common stock at a price range not greater than nor less than per share 
the company concluded on march   the tender offer  whereby it acquired  shares at a share 
the company  given its businesses  assets  and prospects  believes that purchasing its class a stock is an attractive investment that will benefit the company and its remaining shareholders and is consistent with its long term goals of maximizing shareholder return and with its recent purchases of outstanding shares 
the company had minimal exposure to interest rates as of december   as substantially all of its outstanding long term debt bears fixed rates 
as previously discussed  the new credit facility will bear variable interest rates based on either a federal funds rate or the eurodollar rate 
accordingly  future borrowings under the new credit facility will have exposure to changes in interest rates 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
also  the company  currently  is not using any fuel hedging instruments 
it is the management s opinion that the company s foreseeable cash requirement will be met through a combination of internally generated funds and the credit available from the new credit facility 
long lived assets the company periodically assesses the net realizable value of its long lived assets and evaluates such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company continues to assess the recoverability of the goodwill associated with two recent acquisitions 
the total amount under review is million 
the company does not believe there is an impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill 
impact of seasonality shipments of manufactured homes tend to decline in the winter months in areas where poor weather conditions inhibit transport 
this usually reduces operating revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
the company s operating revenues  therefore  tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters 
year compliance the company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely affected by year software failures and has established a project team to address the year issue 
the company has a program in place designed to bring the systems into year compliance in time to minimize any significant detrimental effects on operations 
our goal is to have our remediated and replaced systems operational by july to allow time for testing and verification 
in addition  executive management regularly monitors the status of the company s year remediation plans 
the company has completed the assessment of year issues 
the first phase of the compliance plan has been completed with installation and conversion to a mainframe computer 
this computer provides adequate computing power to complete application software conversion and application remediation 
the second phase of the compliance plan was conversion to year compliant financial software in february  the third phase of the year compliance program involves the remediation and or replacement of operating systems 
rather than remediate  a significant portion of the operating software is being replaced by compliant purchased software 
implementation is scheduled to be completed by july the company is using both internal and external resources to complete this phase 
systems ranked highest in priority are scheduled first for replacement  with final testing and certification for year readiness scheduled for september the company has performed an evaluation of its non information systems  such as communication voice mail systems and telephone switches 
the cost of these modifications or upgrades is expected to be less than  this compliance plan should be completed by july the company also faces risk to the extent that services and systems purchased by the company and others with whom the company transacts business do not comply with year requirements 
as part of the year compliance program  significant service providers  vendors  customers and governmental entities that are believed to be critical to business operations after january   have been identified and steps are being undertaken in an attempt to reasonably determine their stage of year readiness 
external and internal costs specifically associated with modifying internal use software for year compliance are expensed as incurred 
the total amount expended on the project through december   was  costs to be incurred in to fix year problems are estimated at approximately  these estimated costs do not include normal ongoing costs for computer hardware and software that would be replaced even without the presence of the year issue 
the company does not expect the costs relating to year remediation to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
based on the progress the company has made in addressing its year issues and the company s plan and timeline to complete its compliance program  the company does not foresee significant risks associated with its year compliance at this time 
as the company s plan is to address its significant year issues prior to being affected by them  it has not developed a comprehensive contingency plan 
however  if the company identifies significant risks related to its year compliance or its progress deviates from the anticipated timeline  the company will develop contingency plans as deemed necessary at that time 
the company believes today that the most likely worst case scenario will involve temporary disruptions in payments from customers and temporary disruptions in the delivery of services and products to the company 
the company would expect that if these events were to occur  increased expense would result and adversely affect the company s cash flow 
the estimates and conclusions herein contain forward looking statements and are based on management s best estimates of future events 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will timely identify and remediate all significant year problems  that remedial efforts will not involve significant time and expense  or that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial position
