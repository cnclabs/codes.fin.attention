item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company commenced operations in as a provider of telecommunications network transmission products that enable advanced telecommunications services over copper telephone wires 
until fiscal  the company derived substantially all of its revenues from its ds and ds product lines  particularly the sale of nius and related products  which accounted for at least of revenues in each of the last three fiscal years 
the company introduced its first dsl products in fiscal and these products represented  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company has also provided audio teleconferencing services since fiscal which constituted  and of the company s revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in july  the company completed the disposition of kpins  its consumer products claims processing subsidiary  which is presented in the results of operations as a discontinued operation 
the company s customer base is comprised primarily of the rbocs  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
in late fiscal  the company significantly increased its investment in new product development based on emerging technologies  particularly adsl  and began expanding its sales and marketing efforts to cover new product lines 
as a result of the significant increases in research and development and sales and marketing expenses related to new product and market development  the company s results of operations were adversely impacted in fiscal  and the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities and expects to receive funding from certain partners to offset a portion of these development costs 
this will require the company to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing  which is expected to adversely affect short term results of operations 
due to the company s significant ongoing investment in dsl technology  management anticipates losses in each of the fiscal quarters 
the company believes that its future revenue growth and profitability will principally depend on its success in increasing sales of adsl products and developing new and enhanced ds and other dsl products 
in view of the company s reliance on the emerging adsl market for growth and the unpredictability of orders and subsequent revenues  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
revenues from ds products have declined in recent years as telcos continue to move to networks that deliver higher speed from analog to digital transmission services 
the company also expects that revenues from niu products in its ds product group may decline as telcos increase the use of alternative technologies such as hdsl 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues represented by certain items in the company s statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  equipment services total revenues cost of equipment cost of services total cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses operating loss from continuing operations other income  net interest expense loss from continuing operations before income taxes benefit for income taxes loss from continuing operations discontinued operations loss net loss fiscal years ended march   and revenues

higher unit shipments were offset in part by lower average unit selling prices due to changes in product mix and competitive pricing pressures

the fiscal gross profit margin was significantly effected by a reserve taken for adsl phase iii piece part inventories in the amount of million during the third quarter of this inventory reserve was the result of the new generation product reducing demand for the prior generation flexcap iii adsl products 
excluding the impact of this inventory reserve  the gross profit margin would have been for fiscal fiscal gross margin decreased to from the adjusted fiscal gross margin of 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of continued pricing pressures and product mix changes for ds and ds products as well as aggressive pricing of dsl products to capture and stimulate early market activity

sales and marketing was up slightly in fiscal due to increases at conference plus to support growth in the teleconference service revenue 
this increase was partially offset by decreases resulting from management initiatives undertaken late fiscal to streamline dsl sales and marketing 
the company believes that continued investment in sales and marketing will be required to expand its product lines  bring new products to market and service customers 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  constituting  and of revenues  respectively 
the fiscal increase in research and development expense was due primarily to costs associated with additional personnel and increased contract development expenses to support new and existing product development

 equipment service total revenues cost of equipment sales cost of services total cost of goods sold gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss the company s quarterly equipment revenues have varied from quarter to quarter due to quarterly fluctuations in dsl revenues from uneven levels of trials and deployments 
a majority of dsl shipments made in fiscal and were for trials and initial service deployments and therefore have not created steady or predictable demand for these products on a quarter to quarter basis 
ds revenues have increased fairly steadily in fiscal and due to a combination of changes in product mix and increased unit shipments offset in part by continued competitive pricing pressures 
revenues in the ds product family have declined steadily in fiscal and as telcos migrate from lower signal level analog networks to local access networks based upon higher signal level digital products 
service revenues have seen steady growth throughout the eight quarters presented due primarily to increased audio conference calling traffic volume 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue has also varied from quarter to quarter 
the decreases in gross margins are primarily due to competitive pricing pressures and product mix changes in each of the company s equipment product lines as well as investments in manufacturing infrastructure 
the decreased gross margins in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal were primarily the result of recording forward pricing losses of million   and  respectively  for dsl orders received 
additionally  the company s conference plus  inc subsidiary opened a second facility and made additional infrastructure enhancements to handle increased call minutes which also impacted margins 
the company believes that its gross margin in future periods will depend on a number of factors  including market demand for the company s dsl products  pricing pressures  competitive technologies and manufacturing expenses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase gross margins in future periods due to these factors  even if its dsl products achieve market acceptance 
operating expenses increased during the first two quarters of fiscal primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel to support the development  introduction and promotion of dsl systems and other new products 
in the third quarter of fiscal the company recorded a restructuring charge of million for personnel  facility and certain development contract costs related to restructuring global operations 
operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal decreased as a result of restructuring actions taken in the previous quarter 
operating expenses increased in each of the first three quarters of fiscal and decreased in the forth quarter of fiscal when compared to the same quarter in the previous year  excluding the restructuring charges 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses decreased in each quarter of fiscal when compared to the same quarter in the previous year  excluding the restructuring charges 
as a result of fluctuations in the timing of revenues of dsl products and research and development and sales and marketing expenses  the company currently anticipates net losses in each of the quarters of fiscal the company expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the company believes that fluctuations in quarterly results may cause the market price of the class a common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of one or a small number of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
because the company generally ships products within a short period after receipt of an order  the company typically does not have a material backlog of unfilled orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
the company s expense levels are based in large part on anticipated future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
therefore  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders 
accordingly  any significant shortfall of demand in relation to the company s expectations or any material delay of customer orders would have an almost immediate adverse impact on the company s business and results of operations and on its ability to achieve profitability 
liquidity and capital resources at march  the company had million in cash and cash equivalents consisting primarily of federal government agency instruments and the highest rated grade corporate commercial paper 
as of march   the company had  outstanding under its secured revolving promissory notes and million outstanding under its equipment borrowing facility 
as of march   the company had approximately million available under the secured revolving promissory note facility 
the revolving promissory notes and the equipment borrowing facility required the maintenance of a minimum cash to current maturity ratio  a current ratio and a maximum debt to net worth ratio 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants 
the company s operating activities used cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a loss from continuing operations before income tax of million net of depreciation and working capital required by an increase in short term investments and receivables  and a decrease in customer deposits 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a loss from continuing operations before income tax of million net of depreciation offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued compensation and a decrease in prepaid expenses 
cash used by operations in fiscal resulted primarily from a loss from continuing operations of million net of depreciation and working capital required by increases in prepaid expenses and receivables  and a decrease in accrued compensation offset by an increase in accounts payable 
capital expenditures in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were principally for machinery  computer and research equipment purchases 
the company expects to spend approximately million in fiscal for capital equipment 
at march   the company s principal sources of liquidity were million of cash and cash equivalents and million under its secured revolving promissory notes facility 
borrowings under the secured revolving promissory notes facility which was unused at march  and had  outstanding at march  bear interest at the bank s prime rate and at march  and  respectively 
the company had a deferred tax asset of approximately million at march  this deferred tax asset relates to i tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  ii a net operating loss carryforward tax benefit of approximately million and iii temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts measured by tax laws 
of such tax credit carryforwards  the first  of credits expire in and  of credits may be carried forward indefinitely 
the net operating loss carryforward begins to expire in realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
although realization of the deferred tax asset is not assured and the company has incurred operating losses for the  and fiscal years  management believes that it is more likely than not that it will generate taxable income sufficient to realize the majority of the tax benefit associated with future temporary differences  nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards prior to their expiration through a tax planning strategy available to the company 
at march   management determined that the strategy was no longer sufficient to realize all of the deferred tax asset and as such the company recorded a valuation allowance of million and recorded an additional million in fiscal on a quarterly basis  management will assess whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
if the tax planning strategy is not sufficient to generate taxable income to recover the deferred tax benefit recorded  an increase in the valuation allowance will be required through a charge to the income tax provision 
however  if the company achieves sufficient profitability or has available additional tax planning strategies to utilize a greater portion of the deferred tax asset  an income tax benefit would be recorded to decrease the valuation allowance 
in april  the company completed a subordinated secured convertible debenture private placement totaling million 
the conversion price of the debenbures is the lower of a a periodically reset fixed price  which is initially per share and which will reset on april  and april  to the ten day average market price then in effect provided that the fixed price may not be less than or greater than per share  and b the floating market price of our class a common stock at time of conversion except that the floating market price may only be imposed under specific conditions set forth in the securities purchase agreement under which the debentures were sold 
the reset fixed price can not fall below 
in addition  under the terms of the debentures  additional shares are issuable due to anti dilution price protection provisions and or if the company enters into certain major transactions such as the sale of substantially all of our assets  a merger or a change in actual voting control 
in connection with the financing  the company issued five year warrants for approximately  shares of class a common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  which is approximately of the initial conversion price of the debentures 
in june  the company entered into a strategic agreement with fujitsu telecommunications europe limited ftel on adsl and hdsl product development  manufacturing  and global marketing 
as part of this agreement  ftel will assist the company in the funding of certain future developments of adsl products 
additionally  the company transferred substantially all of the assets of westell europe limited wel  its united kingdom operations  to ftel and employees of wel  headquartered in cambridge  england  became employees of ftel 
additionally  ftel assumed wel s lease of office space  purchased certain fixed assets and inventories of wel and earned manufacturing rights 
year compliance issue the company has determined that it is required to modify and or replace portions of its software systems so that they will properly utilize dates beyond december  the year compliance 
the company believes that with software upgrades and modifications and with the conversion to new software  the impact of the year on its computer systems can be mitigated 
however  if the upgrades  modifications and conversions are not made  or are not made in a timely manner  the year could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the implementation of the plan to remediate the company s information technology it systems  which included efforts to mitigate the impact that the year will have on the company  was substantially completed as of march  the project 
the project included upgrading system software  hardware and processes that are not exclusively related to year compliance 
the project utilized both internal and external resources 
the company has a full time manager dedicated to the project as well as addressing other year compliance issues 
the project cost for the company is estimated to be million 
these costs are expensed as incurred  except for approximately  that was capitalized unrelated to year compliance 
the company has expensed approximately  related this project  as of march  with the remaining  to be expensed over the next two years as operating lease payments come due 
the upgrading of system software  hardware and processes was essentially completed as of march   as planned and within previous cost estimates 
the company has assessed how the year will impact both internal and external non it systems including product compliance  machinery and equipment  engineering support systems and tools  human resource data bases  payroll processing  banking systems  benefit plan third party administrators  and customer systems and vendor compliance 
the company has made an assessment that products produced by the company  and systems used by the company to manufacture products  are year compliant  however  the company is currently testing its products and manufacturing systems to assure that year issues have been entirely addressed 
the company is continuing to question customers and vendors to determine whether their systems and products are year compliant 
the company has received sufficient information from a majority of its customers and vendors that year compliance of customers or vendors will not materially impact the company s operations 
the company expects to complete the assessment of the impact of vendor and or customer year compliance deficiency by october  the company has completed its assessment of year compliance of its engineering support systems and automated engineering tools 
the engineering systems and tools utilized by the company that are integral to product development schedules are upgraded annually through license renewals 
the current upgrades of the engineering support systems and automated engineering tools are year compliant 
the company has completed its testing of year compliance of the engineering systems and tools 
management believes that year compliance will not have a significant impact on the company s development schedules 
the company s human resource database and the payroll processing systems have been evaluated for year compliance and must be upgraded in order to be year compliant 
the cost of this upgrade will not be significant and the company anticipates that this upgrade will be completed by october  the company has received confirmation that its primary banks and its benefit plan third party administrators systems are or will be year compliant 
the company believes that it is proactive in assessing the impact that the year will have on both its internal and external it and non it systems 
where material and where feasible  the cost of year compliance has been quantified 
the company is at varying stages of evaluating the impacts of the year on its business and its results of operations 
the company believes that its actions  evaluations and processes currently undertaken are sufficient to assess and mitigate the impacts that the year will have on the company 
however  since the evaluations described above are  at this time  not complete  the company may discover ways in which the lack of year compliance  whether by the company or by third parties  could materially affect the company s operations 
the company has developed a contingency plan to address all possible effects that the year may have on its operations 
management believes that its actions  evaluations and processes should provide sufficient time to address the year risks as they are revealed 
risks related to customer year noncompliance are not within the company s control  however  and therefore  the noncompliance of customer systems may materially adversely impact the company s operations 
year compliance of the company s vendors is also not within the control of the company 
however  the company believes that it will have sufficient time to mitigate vendor year noncompliance and replace such vendors with vendors that are year compliant due to the general availability of electrical component material in the company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk westell is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency and interest rates 
the company has foreign subsidiaries in canada and ireland that develop and sell products and services in those respective countries 
the company is exposed to potential gains and losses from foreign currency fluctuation affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies
