in  the company entered into a rights agreement and distributed rights to purchase limited partner units under certain circumstances to the holders of its limited partner units unitholders 
initially  the rights were attached to all unit certificates representing units then outstanding  and no separate rights certificates were distributed 
under the rights agreement  the rights were to separate from the limited partner units and be distributed to unitholders if any public announcement was made that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons an acquiring person had acquired  or obtained a right to acquire  beneficial ownership of or more of limited partner units 
in august  a group of unitholders announced that they had an informal understanding that they would vote their limited partner units together as a block 
the agreement related to limited partner units that constituted approximately of the limited partner units then outstanding 
therefore  the rights became exercisable on october   the record date for the issuance of the rights certificates the distribution date 
the rights currently represent the right to purchase a rights unit which is substantially equivalent to a class a unit of the company at a price of per unit 
however  if any person acquires or more of the limited partner units  then each holder of a right  other than an acquiring person  will have the right to receive  upon exercise  rights units or in certain circumstances  other property having a value of per unit 
the rights will expire on august   and do not have any voting rights or rights to cash distributions 
in the december restructuring  the partnership s partnership agreement was amended to prohibit any person from owning more than of the limited partner units 
the amended agreement provides that any transfer thereafter that would result in a person owning more than this amount will be null and void  and the units that were to be transferred will become excess units  which will have no voting or distribution rights and will be held in escrow by the company

see item business forward looking statements 
the primary tenant of the company s properties is ffp marketing  and the business and affairs of the company are managed by individuals who are employed by ffp marketing 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the annual report on form k of ffp marketing for its fiscal year ended december  the failure for any reason by ffp marketing to pay rent to the company is a material risk factor regarding an investment in the limited partner units 
at the close of its fiscal year  the company and its assets and businesses were restructured as follows the company retained all of the real property used in its former retail operations and entered into long term  triple net leases of that real property with ffp marketing  and all of its other assets and businesses were transferred to ffp marketing 
in addition to retaining the real estate referred to above  the company retained certain liabilities  principally bank debt and other debt secured by the real estate retained by it 
all other liabilities including trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  money orders payable  deferred income taxes  and obligations under capital leases were transferred to ffp marketing 
accordingly  the company s business since the december restructuring consists of the leasing and management of its current real estate holdings and the possible acquisition  leasing and management of additional real properties 
all operations  assets  and businesses of the company prior to are not comparable to the operations  assets  and businesses of the company after the december restructuring 
operations in  the company completed its first year of operations after the december restructuring 
the company incurred a net loss of  total revenues were  almost all of which was rental income received from ffp marketing 
interest expense of  was incurred on long term debt 
in addition  the company also built equity in its real estate properties by making principal payments of  in reduction of its long term debt 
depreciation and amortization expense for was  general and administrative expenses were  in  including the overhead reimbursement fee of  paid to ffp marketing 
cash flows provided by operating activities of  and investing activities of  were utilized in repaying indebtedness 
inflation the company s real property leases with ffp marketing provide that the company s rent income will increase every five years  assuming that those leases are renewed at that time  as a result of increases in the consumer price index during the prior five year period 
otherwise  the company believes inflation will not have a material effect on operating results 
liquidity and capital resources the company has contracted with ffp marketing to provide all cash management services on behalf of the company 
effective june  the company  ffp marketing and ffp marketing s primary bank lender reached an agreement to restructure the revolving credit facility and term loan due to the lender 
in connection with the restructuring of the company in december  both the company and ffp marketing retained the liability for this debt as both entities were primary obligors on the loans 
in accordance with the june agreement  the lender made a loan to ffp marketing  ffp marketing made a loan to the company  and the company repaid the balance of its debt to the lender  all of which was done effective on june  this transaction included the execution of a promissory note by the company payable to ffp marketing in the original principal amount of  the then current balance on the debt due to the lender  which was recorded by the company as notes payable to affiliate  and the company was released by the lender from all obligations under the loan and security agreement 
at december   the company was indebted to ffp marketing in the amount of  the interest rate and repayment terms of the company s debt payable to ffp marketing mirror the terms of ffp marketing s debt to its lender  including a maturity date of november the revised agreement with the lender also required that the loan be secured by real estate owned by the company  which was pledged to ffp marketing and then also pledged by ffp marketing to its lender as additional collateral on its debt to the lender 
the company makes monthly principal payments to ffp marketing of  plus accrued interest on the unpaid balance at a rate equal to the bank s prime rate 
all proceeds paid by the company to ffp marketing on this loan are required to be applied to the balance of ffp marketing s debt to the lender 
the company has other notes payable which bear interest at to and are due in monthly or annual installments through such notes are secured by real property and had aggregate balances of  at december  in february  the company purchased additional improved real property from a third party on which convenience stores and two truck stops are operational 
the company immediately leased the properties to ffp marketing under year leases 
the company s rental income from ffp marketing under those leases equals  per month and equals the company s monthly principal and interest payments payable under its acquisition debt 
such rent amount was established by related parties  but management believes that such rent amount is consistent with market rates  however  no assurance can be given to that effect 
the leases are triple net leases  under which ffp marketing pays all taxes  insurance  and operating costs  and provide for an increase in rent payments after each five year period during the term of the leases based upon any increase in the consumer price index 
the company incurred long term acquisition debt in the original principal amount of  in connection with its february acquisition 
that debt is fully amortizable over years with equal  monthly payments of principal and interest 
ffp marketing also agreed to guarantee the company s acquisition indebtedness because the amount of ffp marketing s monthly lease payments to the company equals the company s monthly debt payments 
the company is currently seeking funds from a third party lender to refinance its long term indebtedness 
such refinancing is expected to provide for equal  monthly principal and interest payments over a year amortization period 
in april  the company executed a letter of intent with a third party lender to provide such financing 
however  the company has not yet received a binding commitment to refinance its current debt or to fund the acquisition of any additional properties 
year computer issues the year issue yk is the result of computer software programs being coded to use two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
some of computer programs that have date sensitive coding may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this coding could result in system failures or miscalculations  causing disruptions of operations 
the company relies on ffp marketing for its information technology and computerization and obtains those  in part  in exchange for the payment of an annual overhead reimbursement fee 
as a result  the yk risks of the company are the same as those of ffp marketing 
the following is ffp marketing s assessment of its k status 
ffp marketing has approached the yk issue in phases 
a yk project office manager  together with strong support from management  has designed a yk work plan that is currently being implemented 
the yk work plan includes identifying and inventorying all year tasks and items  assigning priorities to all tasks and items  remediation of information systems is application code  testing and reintegration to production  as well as testing all replaced systems software and non remediated applications  contacting third party vendors to verify their compliance and perform selected interface tests with major vendors  determining ffp marketing s yk responsibilities to its subsidiaries and affiliates  and establishing contingency alternatives assuming worst case scenarios 
ffp marketing continues to progress favorably in its completion of the various tasks and target dates identified in the yk work plan 
ffp marketing believes it has identified and prioritized all major yk related items 
in addition  many non is  merchandise  equipment  financial institution  insurance and public utility vendors are being contacted  inquiring as to their readiness and the readiness of their respective vendors 
ffp marketing will perform follow up efforts with the above vendors as required 
testing compliance with major vendors is now being planned 
the following reflects management s assessment of ffp marketing s yk state of readiness at the end of its fiscal year estimated estimated percentage completion completed date phase internal is and non is systems and equipment awareness dec assessment jun remediation sep testing oct contingency planning sep suppliers  customers and third party providers awareness identify companies may assessment questionnaire completed by major suppliers aug assessment review with third party providers aug review contractual commitments jul risk assessment jun contingency planning sep testing as applicable sep ffp marketing s estimates are judgmental and subject to error 
it believes that work should be significantly finished at the estimated completion date  but ffp marketing will continue to reevaluate awareness  send follow up questionnaires and update contingency plans as considered necessary 
ffp marketing estimates that the cost of the yk project will be approximately  to  of which about one half will be capital costs 
ffp marketing has indicated that it does not intend to pass through any yk costs to the company 
the costs incurred to date approximate  with the remaining cost for outside consultants  software and hardware applications to be funded through operating cash flow 
this estimate includes costs related to the upgrade and or replacement of computer software and hardware  costs of remediated code testing and test result verification  and the reintegration to production of all remediated applications 
in addition  the costs include the testing of applications and software currently certified as yk compliant 
ffp marketing does not separately track the internal costs incurred for the yk project  which are primarily the related payroll costs for the is and various user personnel participating in the project 
due to the general uncertainty inherent in the yk process  primarily due to issues surrounding the yk readiness of third party suppliers and vendors  a reasonable worst case scenario is difficult to determine at this time 
ffp marketing does not anticipate more than temporary isolated disruptions attributed to yk issues to affect either ffp marketing or its primary vendors 
ffp marketing is concentrating on four critical business areas in order to identify  evaluate and determine the scenarios requiring the development of contingency plans merchandise ordering and receipt  petroleum products ordering and receipt  disruption of power at retail sites  and cash collection and disbursement systems 
to the extent vendors are unable to deliver products due to their own year issues  ffp marketing believes it will generally have alternative sources for comparable products and does not expect to experience any material business disruptions 
although considered unlikely  the failure of public utility companies to provide telephone and electrical service could have material consequences 
contingency planning efforts will escalate as ffp marketing continues to receive and evaluate responses from all of its primary merchandise vendors and service providers 
these contingency plans are scheduled to be complete by september the costs of the yk project and the date on which ffp marketing plans to complete the yk modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
as a result  there can be no assurance that these forward looking estimates will be achieved and the actual costs 
vendor compliance could differ materially from ffp marketing s current expectations and result in a material financial risk 
in addition  while ffp marketing is making significant efforts in addressing all anticipated yk risks within its control  this event is unprecedented 
consequently  there can be no assurance that the yk issue will not have a material adverse impact on its own or on the company s operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to a market risk related to variable interest rates because the interest expense on its long term debt payable to ffp marketing equals the prime rate of interest  which is subject to change
