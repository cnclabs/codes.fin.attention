item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements regarding the company s management of credit risk  credit policies generally  allowances for loan losses  and the affect of increasing interest rates on the company s profitability 
several factors  including the virginia and national economy  the demand for residential mortgage loans  and the adequacy of the company s year readiness could have a material affect on the company s anticipated results 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date of this form k 
on december   the bank acquired eastern american bank  fsb  in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  whereby the purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the time of acquisition 
in exchange for issuing shares of the bank s common stock to eastern american bank s shareholders  the bank acquired  in assets including cash of   in net loans  and assumed  in deposit liabilities 
accordingly  these acquired assets and liabilities contributed to the growth in total assets and liabilities of the bank for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results include results by operations from the former eastern american bank for the month of december the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and notes thereto included as exhibit of this form k 
results of operations and financial condition the company had net income of   and  for  and  respectively 
this constituted net basic earnings per common share of for  for  and for with the diluted effect of common stock equivalents  earnings per common share increased by to for  from in and in the expanded levels of earning assets increased net interest income during significantly over and this factor  along with managed expense control and expansion of the business loan portfolio  provided the basis for increased earnings 
at december   of total loans were due in one year or less 
floating rate loans with maturities of one year or less represented of total loans  and the remainder of such loans had fixed rates 
average loans  net of unearned income  to average deposits were  and in  and  respectively

the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans at year end was  and at december   and  respectively 
the level of non performing loans at year end was   and  in  and  or  and of total loans  respectively 
management made a provision for loan losses of  in   in and  in the majority of non accrual loans emanated from eastern american bank at the time of the merger in december the company executed a plan to substantially reduce the level of non accruing loans in its northern virginia portfolio during as the result of significant reductions in problem assets and the addition of several experienced commercial lending officers  management believes that asset quality within the northern virginia loan portfolio at december   was comparable to the rest of the bank 
in establishing the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors  including loan asset quality  related collateral and economic conditions prevailing during the loan s repayment 
in its loan policies  management emphasizes the borrower s ability to service the debt  the borrower s general creditworthiness and the quality of collateral 
while management believes that the allowance is sufficient for the existing loan portfolio  there can be no assurances that an additional allowance for losses on existing loans may not be necessary in the future  particularly if economic conditions within the company s market areas were to deteriorate 
potential problem loans at december   the company had  in non accrual loans  a reduction of from december  the company had  in loans past due days or more that were still accruing at december  in addition to loans on either non accrual status or loans past due days or more and still accruing  management had identified  of loans that have been internally classified 
these loans require more than normal attention and are potentially problem loans 
at december   the bank had  in non accrual loans and  of loans past due days or more that were still accruing 
in addition to loans on either non accrual status or loans past due days or more and still accruing  the bank had identified  of loans that were internally classified 
noninterest income and noninterest expenses noninterest income was  in  an increase of over this increase was due to the merger transaction with eastern american bank and income derived from mortgage banking operations 
noninterest income was  in a increase over  derived primarily from mortgage banking operations 
the general decline in market interest rates  which began in and continued into  was a factor in the increase of mortgage banking income of in to  mortgage banking income increased by in over to  because of the uncertainty of future loan origination volume and the future level of interest rates  there can be no assurance that the company will realize the same level of mortgage banking income in future periods 
other noninterest income from fees and service charges in  increased by to  mainly from the increased volume of deposit account activity after the merger transaction 
total noninterest expense was  in  a increase over all areas of noninterest expenses were affected by the increased volume in the mortgage banking operations and the merger transaction 
as the result of the merger with eastern american bank  approximately full time employees and office locations were integrated into the bank s operations 
total noninterest expense was  in  an increase of over the largest component of noninterest expense  salaries and employee benefits  increased in over to  salaries and employee benefits increased in to  this category comprised of the total noninterest expense in  in and in occupancy expense increased in over to  occupancy expense increased in over depreciation and equipment maintenance expense increased in over to  depreciation and equipment maintenance expense increased in over outside computer service expense increased to  in outside computer service expense increased in to  federal deposit insurance corporation fdic premiums increased to  in over fdic premiums increased to  in from  in as the result of the merger with eastern american bank  fdic insurance premiums are assessed on the bank s deposit base on a pro rata basis whereby approximately percent of the bank s deposits are subject to bank insurance fund bif rates  and approximately percent of deposits are subject to savings association insurance fund saif rates 
this ratio of bif and saif assessment rates was established at the time of merger  based on the relative sizes of the bank and eastern american bank deposit bases at december  see part i 
item business regulation and supervision of resource bank 
income taxes applicable income taxes on earnings amounted to  resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to in and in the effective rate differed from statutory rates for the year ended december   due to the bank s utilization of net operating loss carryforwards for financial statement purposes during as a result  the bank recorded a deferred tax asset and related income tax benefit of  for the realization of these loss carryforwards in all net operating loss carryforwards were fully utilized in the year ended december  for financial statement and income tax return purposes 
liquidity the company s funding requirements are supplied from a range of traditional sources  including various types of demand deposits  money market accounts  certificates of deposit and short term borrowings 
large certificates of deposit accounted for  and of total deposits at december   and  respectively 
federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb advances were also utilized as funding sources  with  and  in such advances outstanding at december  and december   respectively 
pursuant to the terms of a variable rate line of credit with the fhlb  the bank may borrow up to  this fhlb credit facility has no expiration date  but is re evaluated periodically to determine the bank s creditworthiness  and can be prepaid at anytime 
additionally  the bank has a warehouse line of credit collateralized by first mortgage loans  amounting to  which expires december  as of december   there was no balance drawn from this line of credit 
management has no reason to believe these arrangements will not be renewed 
management seeks to ensure adequate liquidity to fund loans and meet the company s financial requirements and opportunities 
to provide liquidity for current  ongoing and unanticipated needs  the company maintains short term interest bearing certificates of deposits  federal funds sold  and a portfolio of debt securities 
the company also structures and monitors the flow of funds from debt securities and from maturing loans 
as securities are generally purchased to provide a source of liquidity  most are classified as securities available for sale when purchased 
unrealized holding gains and losses for available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
securities are composed primarily of governmental or quasi governmental agencies 
net unrealized appreciation  net of tax effect  on securities available for sale was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company from time to time also maintains short term interest bearing certificates of deposit with other financial institutions 
these certificates of deposit amounted to and  at december  and  respectively 
federal funds sold to correspondent institutions were  and  at year end and  respectively 
the company raised approximately  of additional capital in the first quarter of by issuing  trust preferred securities at a price of per security 
the trust preferred securities feature a coupon 
the company has  in turn  purchased  of non cumulative preferred stock issued by the bank 
this preferred stock will qualify as tier capital for the bank for regulatory purposes 
management believes that this additional tier capital will provide the bank with an increased loans to one borrower limitation  and the ability to continue to grow its balance sheet while maintaining its well capitalized status 
the preferred stock coupon will match the coupon of the trust preferred securities 
the remainder of funds generated by the trust preferred securities offering  estimated at  after offering expenses  will be invested in marketable securities and used by the company in its stock repurchase program 
the marketable securities will be held as available for sale to meet liquidity needs 
the company s stock repurchase program will be used to offset the otherwise dilutive effects of stock options granted to the company s management as employment recruitment and retention perquisites 
impact of accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was issued in june this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  management will assess the impact  if any  on the company s financial statements 
the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  the sop requires entities to capitalize certain internal use software costs once certain criteria are met 
generally  internal costs with respect to software configuration and interface  coding  installation to hardware  testing including parallel processing  and data conversion costs allowing access of old data by new systems should be capitalized 
all other data conversion costs  training  application maintenance  and ongoing support activities should be expensed 
the company will adopt this sop in and does not expect it to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations 
the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of startup activities  in april the sop requires such costs to be expensed as incurred instead of being capitalized and amortized 
it applies to startup activities and costs of organization of both development state and established operating activities  and it changes existing practice for some industries 
the sop broadly defines startup activities as those one time activities that relate to the opening of a new facility  introduction of a new product or service  doing business in a new territory  initiating a new process in an existing facility  doing business with a new class of customer or beneficiary  or commencing some new operation 
the sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  consistent with banking industry practice it is the company s policy to expense such costs 
therefore  this sop is not expected to materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
capital resources and adequacy the federal reserve board  the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency have issued substantially similar risk based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to banking organizations they supervise 
due to the bank s capitalization  the company is classified as well capitalized 
the company s year end capital to asset ratio was at december  as compared to at december  the capital adequacy standards are based on an established minimum for risk based capital  tier risk based capital and the tier leverage ratio 
the following table summarizes the company s regulatory capital ratios at december  required ratio actual ratio tier risk based total risk based tier leverage to the company is in full compliance with all relevant regulatory capital requirements 
year compliance the ability of the company s computers  software and other equipment utilizing microprocessors to recognize and properly process data fields containing a digit year after is commonly referred to as the year issue 
the year issue is the result of computer programs and equipment which are dependent on embedded chip technology using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs or equipment that are date dependent may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  or a temporary inability to process transactions  or otherwise engage in similar normal business activities 
the company adopted a five phase plan of action developed by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec to address year issues 
during phase one  awareness  the company developed an overall strategy and timetable for the completion of all year requirements 
phase two  assessment  involved analyzing  prioritizing and putting all internal systems  both information technology it and non it systems  on track for year compliance according to the timetable established in the awareness phase 
the company has no proprietary or in house developed systems or software  so non it systems are limited to infrastructure and communications 
during the third phase  renovation  necessary upgrades were ordered for hardware and software 
in addition  each of the company s vendors was contacted regarding their year progress 
phases one through three have been completed 
the company changed data processors in late and is processed by a service bureau which houses and maintains all hardware  software and backups applicable to updating and maintaining the company s customer and financial records 
because this is the area of greatest risk to the company with regard to year issues  this arrangement means the company must carefully oversee the efforts of the vendor to ensure year compliance is complete and timely 
the data processor has renovated and tested its systems and has supplied a series of reports of their progress 
the final stages of its live data testing was scheduled during the first quarter of and to date all applications have tested year ready 
as the company proceeds with the fourth phase  validation  it will continue to monitor the validation of all its vendors systems  as well as continue validation of its internal systems through ongoing actual real life testing of all the new upgrades and components 
the company will continue testing and validation throughout the remainder of to ensure the continuing reliability of its systems 
the final phase  implementation  will occur at the turn of the century with the readiness to execute contingency plans if necessary 
contingency plans include alternatives for each critical system  which should allow business to continue with little or no interruption past the turn of the century 
these alternatives are being subjected to the same process as the company s primary service providers 
additionally  the contingency plans include performing tasks manually if necessary  until the appropriate applications are operational 
in addition to verifying its internal and vendor supplied systems  the company has provided compliance certification questionnaires to its customers in order to determine their ability to be year compliant 
if a customer does not respond to the questionnaire or if its response does not provide the company with adequate assurance that such customer s failure to be year compliant would not have a material adverse effect on the company  the company is entitled to take steps to terminate its relationship with the customer before december costs to date directly attributable to the year project have not been substantial due to the fact that the change in data processors and the acquisition of a bank in late required a complete upgrade of all desktop computer systems and servers 
year compliance was an important part of all purchases and management believes that any known issues were corrected 
the year progress of all data processing companies is being monitored by outside auditors and regulators and the company receives regular reports regarding the progress 
costs to date total  however  testing by outside vendors may exceed thousand based on best estimates available to date 
management anticipates that these funds will be financed internally 
because the company had a detailed business continuation plan before the year plan began  various potential business interruptions and alternatives were already documented which would permit a short term continuance as long as the data processor preserves the ability to update records 
loss of the data processor is the greatest risk to the company 
the year progress of all data processing companies is being monitored by outside auditors and regulators and the company receives regular reports regarding the progress 
while a change of data processors would be time consuming  the company s contingency plans include alternatives for each critical system  as well as plans to perform tasks manually if necessary  until appropriate applications are operational 
the company s year readiness is subject to supervision by the federal reserve system through examination for compliance with the guidance issued by the ffiec 
should the company s readiness be found deficient  it could be subject to informal enforcement actions such as written notification of deficiencies to be remediated  to formal enforcement actions such as civil penalties  temporary cease and desist orders requiring immediate corrective actions  and the possible public release of any such cease and desist order 
if the company and its customers  suppliers and vendors were not year compliant by january   the most reasonably likely worst case scenario would be a temporary shutdown of operations 
any such shutdown could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management s methodology to measure interest rate sensitivity includes an analysis of the potential gain or loss in future fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments 
the company s analysis assumes a hypothetical basis point instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve in interest rates 
a present value computation is used in determining the effect of the hypothetical interest rate changes on the fair value of its interest rate sensitive instruments as of december  computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on many assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay 
they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in this method of analysis 
if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of present value  actual values may differ from amounts disclosed 
however  if a hypothetical  parallel and instantaneous basis point increase and decrease were experienced  net fair values of interest sensitive instruments would be decreased by  and increased by  respectively 
this fair value analysis  performed for the company by a third party vendor  tends to overstate interest rate risk within the company s balance sheet 
the analysis assigns the contractual long term maturity to mortgage loans within the funds advanced for settlement account 
such loans are generally held by the company for less than days  being pre sold to third party purchasers when the individual borrowers lock in their interest rates 
this extension of loan terms within this category of the company s balance sheet increases interest rate risk sensitivity calculated by the analysis 
the analysis also does not include a forecast of loan and deposit volume changes due to the hypothetical basis point interest rate change 
in addition  anticipated increased volume in the company s mortgage banking operation from a basis point decrease in rates is not included in the analysis 
this expected volume increase in mortgage lending as the result of a decline in interest rates would positively impact the company s earnings 
the standard algebraic formula for calculating present value is utilized 
the calculation discounts the future cash flows of the company s portfolio of interest rate sensitive instruments to present value utilizing techniques designed to approximate current market rates for securities  current offering rates for loans  and the cost of alternative funding for the given maturity of deposits  and then assumes a basis point instantaneous and parallel shift in these rates 
the difference between these numbers represents the resulting hypothetical change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments 
other significant assumptions used in the calculation include no growth in volume ie  replacement of maturities in like instruments  with no change in balance sheet mix  constant market interest rates reflecting the average rate from the last month of the given quarter  and pricing spreads to market rates derived from an historical analysis  or from assumptions by instrument type 
the company is not engaged in investment strategies involving derivative financial instruments 
asset and liability management is conducted without the use of forward based contracts  options  swap agreements  or other synthetic financial instruments
