mutual funds background 
the mutual fund industry has expanded rapidly in the last several years 
according to the investment company institute  the trade association for investment companies  total assets of us mutual funds have increased from billion at december  to trillion at december   an average growth rate of approximately per year 
in the mutual fund industry  mutual funds may be sold to investors with a sales charge or a commission a load fund or without a sales charge or a commission a no load fund 
of the seventeen lexington funds  fifteen are no load funds and two are load funds 
mutual funds may also be either closed end or open end 
generally  closed end funds raise money from stockholders only once  unlike an open end fund which issues and redeems shares of the fund on a continuous basis 
in addition  unlike open end mutual funds  closed end funds do not stand ready to redeem their shares at net asset value 
instead  stockholders wishing to sell their shares must do so by trading them on a national securities exchange or in the over the counter market  at a price determined by the market  which may be higher or lower than the fund s net asset value 
all of the company s mutual funds are open end funds 
the mutual fund industry is highly competitive and is currently characterized by a high degree of fragmentation and a large and rapidly increasing number of product offerings 
the company believes that the mutual fund industry is becoming similar to the consumer products business  where marketing strategies  product development  business development  sales expertise and servicing are increasingly important 
investment products and services 
the company has developed the lexington family of mutual funds which are managed  marketed and distributed under the lexington name through lexington management corporation and lexington funds distributor  inc the lexington funds are designed to provide a variety of investment options for retail investors  financial planners and intermediaries  and for the defined benefit and defined contribution marketplace  including the k market 
these funds have been selected for inclusion in various no fee transaction broker programs  such as the charles schwab mutual fund onesource r program 
each of the company s global international equity funds may invest their assets in any country approved by the fund s board of directors provided such assets are custodied with an eligible custodian under rule f of the investment company act of  as amended

strategy 
the company s current strategies in the mutual fund market are to i identify emerging trends in order to develop new investment products  ii strengthen the brand name awareness of the lexington funds both at the broker dealer level and the retail investor level  iii broaden its efforts to offer subadvisory and administration services to other mutual funds  iv expand into other distribution channels  and  v evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities 
the company believes that with focused market research efforts it can identify demographic and industry trends relevant to the growth of the mutual fund business and thereby develop products to meet emerging needs and opportunities 
for example  the company launched the lexington global fund  inc in march after the company s research indicated that international investing was an emerging investment trend which offered the potential for reduced risk and higher expected returns through global diversification 
furthermore  the company believes that its smaller relative size in the mutual fund industry provides it with a competitive advantage by enabling the company to capitalize upon trends more quickly than its competitors 
as another example  in  the company launched the lexington troika dialog russia fund  the first open end fund in the united states devoted to russian equities 
to achieve greater brand name awareness  the company has used media relations consultants to assist in building relationships with the media

the company utilizes a formalized screening and valuation process to identify potential acquisition candidates or strategic partners in order to expand its business 
in addition to the company s management contacts in the mutual fund and investment management industry  an outside consultant has been used in the past to complement management s efforts in this area 
management believes that the integration of financial products with targeted services will also allow it to better pursue opportunities in various markets

stuart s 
richardson  robert m 
demichele and richard m

at this point in time  paa is an inactive company 
marketing and distribution traditionally  load mutual funds were principally sold by registered representatives of broker dealers  who received sales commissions as compensation for fund sales 
no load mutual funds were sold directly to the investing public without the assistance of a registered representative and therefore no sales commission was imposed on the purchase 
the company s products and services are marketed and distributed through a variety of captive and non captive distribution channels which are listed below 
the approximate percentage of assets under management distributed through each of the company s distribution channels listed below is provided in the parenthetical immediately prior to the description of such distribution channel 
the lexington family of no load mutual funds are sold through direct sales and marketing efforts utilizing print  radio and television advertising 
the company also has shareholder servicing arrangements with discount brokers  including charles schwab mutual fund onesource r  fidelity funds network r  jack white company no transaction fee mutual fund service  waterhouse mutual fund connection and first trust corporation 
the company also has a number of its funds included in strategic alliances and wrap programs  which will offer greater distribution opportunities in the future 
at december   approximately million  or  of lmc s total mutual fund assets have been generated through these named shareholder servicing arrangements 
under these shareholder servicing arrangements  the discount broker  which sells  markets and distributes many mutual funds other than the lexington funds is paid a fee for recordkeeping  shareholder communications and other services provided by the discount broker to investors purchasing shares of the lexington funds through the discount broker s programs 
this fee is typically based on the average daily value of the investments in each lexington fund made by the discount broker on behalf of investors participating in the discount broker s program 
while the company has no reason to believe that such shareholder servicing arrangements will be terminated  no assurances can be given that these arrangements will continue or that they will continue to generate a substantial portion of the company s total mutual fund assets 
the loss of any one or more of these shareholder servicing arrangements may materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company s ability to gain and maintain access to these distribution channels is largely dependent on the investment performance of the company s products  the development of new investment products  marketing and pricing strategies that serve the needs of investors and discount brokers and the level of service provided by the company 
although the company historically has been successful in these aspects of its business  there can be no assurance that the company can continue to maintain such access for its products 
the lexington strategic funds  which are precious metal stock funds  as well as funds sponsored by security benefit life insurance company are sold with a sales charge through broker dealers and directly by lfd 
the lexington funds are also sold through banks and insurance companies 
although the company does not control all of its distribution channels  the company believes that the use of multiple distribution channels  including competing non captive distribution channels  stabilizes and increases the distribution of its products 
regulation lmc and msr are registered as investment advisors under the investment advisers act of  as amended the advisory act  and all applicable state securities laws 
lfd is registered as a broker dealer under the securities exchange act of  as amended the act  and all applicable state securities laws 
accordingly  this company is subject to regulation by the securities and exchange commission the sec and state securities commissions and is required to furnish periodic reports and to observe restrictions on certain activities 
each lexington fund is registered with the sec under the investment company act of  as amended the act  and is qualified for sale throughout the united states 
the act imposes restrictions on certain transactions between the lexington funds and lmc 
all aspects of the company s business are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries and states in which lexington  its subsidiaries and affiliates conduct business 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit clients and shareholders and  in some instances may impose minimum capital requirements 
these laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict lexington s business and impose sanctions  to suspend individual employees  to limit the company from engaging in business for specific periods  to revoke lmc s registration as an investment advisor and lfd s registration as a broker dealer and to censure and levy fines 
applicable united states federal laws also include the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
competition the asset management business is highly competitive 
the company competes with a large number of other domestic and foreign asset management firms  commercial banks  insurance companies  broker dealers and others  although as a practical matter the company typically competes with other firms offering comparable investment services and objectives 
according to the money market directory of pension funds and their investment managers  the company ranked among the top largest of investment counsel firms  as measured by total tax exempt assets under management at december as a result  some of the financial services companies with which the company competes have substantially greater resources and assets under management than the company and offer a wider variety of products and services 
the company believes factors which affect its competition for clients include investment performance records  the range of products offered  the abilities and reputations of its portfolio managers  management fees and the development of new investment strategies and marketing  although the importance of these factors can vary depending on the type of asset management service involved 
client service is also an important competitive factor 
the company s ability to increase or retain client assets could be adversely affected if client accounts underperform the market or if portfolio managers leave the company 
the ability of the company to compete with other asset management firms is also dependent  in part  on the relative attractiveness of its investment philosophies and strategies under prevailing market conditions 
there are relatively few barriers to entry by new asset management firms which could increase competitive pressure in the industry 
selection of advisors by investors often is subject to a competitive review process relying heavily upon historical performance 
a large number of mutual funds are sold to the public by asset management firms  broker dealers  insurance companies and banks in competition with the company s mutual funds 
many competitors apply substantial resources to advertising and marketing their mutual funds which may adversely affect the ability of the company s mutual funds to attract new clients and to retain assets under management 
personnel at december   the company employed approximately people 
approximately    and were located in saddle brook  new jersey  gold river  california  dallas  texas  and new york  new york  respectively 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union and the company believes that its relations with its employees are good 
risk factors dependence upon performance record the market for providing investment management services is highly competitive with investors generally favoring investment advisors with a sustained successful investment performance record 
the performance record of the company may be affected by factors over which the company has little or no control  including general economic conditions  other factors influencing the capital markets  the net sales of mutual fund shares generally  and interest rate fluctuations 
concentration of distribution channels and reliance on certain distributors while the company over time has used a variety of distribution channels  currently a substantial percentage of the company s investment product sales are through non captive distribution channels  including no transaction fee programs 
such non captive distribution channels generally offer competing internally and externally sponsored or managed investment products and access to these distribution channels is limited 
the company s ability to gain and maintain access to these distribution channels is largely dependent on the investment performance of the company s products  the development of new investment products  marketing and pricing strategies that serve the needs of investors and the non captive distribution channels and the level of service provided by the company 
although the company historically has been successful in these aspects of its business  there can be no assurance that the company can continue to maintain such access for its products 
as of december   approximately million  or  of the company s total mutual fund assets have been generated through shareholder servicing arrangements with five discount brokers  charles schwab mutual fund onesource r  fidelity funds network r  jack white company no transaction fee mutual fund service  waterhouse mutual fund connection  and first trust corporation 
while the company has no reason to believe that such shareholder servicing arrangements will be terminated  no assurances can be given that these arrangements will continue or that they will continue to generate a substantial portion of the company s total mutual fund assets under management 
the loss of any one or more of these arrangements could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
changes in market conditions  retention of assets under management the company derives the major portion of its revenues from asset management contracts with clients 
under these contracts  the asset management fee paid to the company is typically based on the market value from time to time of assets under management 
accordingly  fluctuations in securities prices could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in addition  institutional asset management contracts are generally terminable upon days notice 
mutual fund and unit trust investors may generally withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice 
institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with the company  or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  and individual clients may elect to close their accounts or redeem their shares in the company s mutual funds or unit trusts  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures  for any of a number of reasons  including investment conditions or changes in prevailing interest rates or financial market conditions 
fees vary with the aggregate amount of assets under management by the company and with the type of asset being managed  with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts and lower fees earned on fixed income and stable return accounts 
global international and precious metal equity mutual fund holdings at december   approximately billion  or  of the company s total assets under management were invested in global international and precious metal equities 
many foreign markets  especially emerging markets and markets where precious metals are mined  may be characterized by volatile economic  political and social conditions 
many of these countries have also experienced significant exchange rate fluctuations between the local currencies and the us dollar which may subject the us dollar value of the company s assets under management in global international and precious metal equities to currency translation risk  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the markets in such countries may also be less liquid and less efficient than domestic markets 
while the company believes international investing offers the potential for reduced risk and higher expected returns through global diversification  fluctuations in foreign markets may have a material adverse effect on the value of the assets under management in the company s global international and precious metal equities 
except for the lexington strategic investments fund  inc  which has a significant portion of its assets under management invested in south africa  the lexington goldfund  inc  which has a significant portion of its assets under management invested in australia  canada and south africa  the lexington crosby small cap asia growth fund  which has a significant portion of its assets under management invested in asia  and the lexington troika dialog russia fund  inc  which has a significant portion of its assets under management invested in russia  the company believes that in general  the assets under management in its global international and precious metal equities funds are invested in a geographically diversified manner 
competition the asset management business is highly competitive 
the company competes with a large number of other domestic and foreign asset management firms  commercial banks  insurance companies  broker dealers and others  although as a practical matter the company typically competes with other firms offering comparable investment services and objectives 
many of the financial services companies with which the company competes have substantially greater resources and assets under management than the company and offer a wider variety of products and services 
reliance on key personnel the company s business is managed by key executive officers  the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company believes that its continued success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
in the event that any officers or directors of the company cease to be associated with the company  the company will seek to find a qualified person or persons to fill their positions with the company 
there can  however  be no assurance that such individuals could be engaged by the company 
the company has reserved  shares of common stock for issuance to key employees under the long term incentive plan established in the plan provides for the granting of stock options  stock appreciation rights and other stock based performance awards to employees 
year the company  like most commercial and financial institutions  is working to ensure that its operating and processing systems will  along with those of its service providers  continue to function when the year arrives 
the company has developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to prepare the company s computer systems and applications for the year  as well as to identify and address any other year operational issues which may affect the company 
progress reports on the company s year program are presented regularly to the company s board of directors and senior management 
the company expects to be year compliant during the second quarter of and is in the process of preparing a contingency plan  which should be completed by the second quarter of although the company believes it is adequately addressing its year issues  the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failure could materially affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition

at december  the company also managed approximately million in invested assets of the richardson family and certain other related persons which represent approximately of the company s total assets under management at such date

the decrease in mutual fund assets is mainly attributable to the termination of an advisory relationship with one of the company s larger accounts in the fourth quarter of assets under management in this relationship were approximately million 
in addition  the turmoil in emerging markets in adversely affected the company s funds with exposure to these markets 
the lexington troika dialog russia fund and the lexington worldwide emerging markets fund each declined by approximately million from december  partially offsetting these declines was strong performance or growth in several other products  most notably the lexington gnma income fund which increased in size by approximately million from december  both the private account and institutional segments  which are primarily invested in the us equity and bond markets  experienced growth in assets through strong performance results associated with the robust us capital markets in for the year ended december   total revenues of million declined by million from million in net mutual fund revenues decreased by approximately million from million to million with the decline in assets under management 
mutual fund commissions of thousand were more than the thousand recorded in because sales of the company s two products with sales loads increased as a result of investor interest in precious metals mutual funds 
other management fees of million are up approximately million from million in the company s private account business accounted for approximately million of the increase due to continued increases in assets under management associated with the continuing strength of the us equity markets 
institutional asset management fees contributed million of the increase 
commission income of thousand decreased thousand from thousand in the decrease is due to client terminations 
other income of million decreased million from million in the decrease is a result of unrealized depreciation of marketable securities 
the unrealized depreciation stems from the company s investments in a number of the funds managed by the company 
total expenses in increased by approximately million to million from million in due primarily to administrative and general expenses  which increased million 
this increase is almost entirely attributable to the company s administrative contract with select advisors select for the company s private account business 
this contract was part of the reorganization of this business  which occurred in under this contract the company pays fees to select for administrative and support services for the company s private account clients 
because these clients are billed annually in advance  the expenses incurred for the administrative contract are amortized evenly over a twelve month period 
the expense includes amortization of the contract expense across the entire client base 
in  the company benefited from the fact that no administrative fees were charged in for those accounts which entered into or renewed advisory agreements in the first nine months of  ie  prior to september   the date of the reorganization 
partially offsetting the increase is a decrease of million in selling and promotional expense  mainly attributed to a reduction in advertising and sales literature for the year 
these expenses declined as the company made greater use of public relations in its promotional efforts 
total personnel costs of million are even with although the costs are even  the company recognized an increase of million of expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock to certain key executive employees 
in addition  salaries increased million due to annual salary increases 
offsetting the increase was a reduction in bonus expense due to the company s lower earnings 
pre tax income of million is million less than the million recorded in the provision for state and federal taxes decreased million due to the decrease in taxable income 
the company used approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards nols in and has remaining nols of approximately million which are available to offset future taxable income which expire over the period through compared with the consolidated net income in was million  per share  compared to net income of million  per share in included in the results is a one time pre tax gain of million per share from the sale of four of the company s west coast subsidiaries 
on september   the company sold four of the california subsidiaries lexington capital management associates lcma  lexington financial services  inc lfsi  lexington plan administrators lpa  and lcmi insurance services lcmii 
on december   the remaining west coast subsidiary  lexington capital management lcm was merged into lexington management corporation lmc  the company s principal operating subsidiary 
total assets under management at december  were billion compared to billion at december  each of the company s three primary served markets  mutual funds  private client  and institutional  contributed billion to the growth in assets 
both the private client and institutional segments  which are primarily invested in the us bond and equity markets  experienced growth in assets through superior performance results associated with the relatively strong us capital markets in mutual fund assets under management grew primarily through net cash inflows of billion 
one of the company s newer products  the lexington troika dialog russia fund  experienced net cash inflows of approximately million in due to superior investment performance ranked number one among emerging markets funds tracked by lipper analytical services  inc and as the number four fund in the overall lipper equity fund universe  funds  one of the company s older products  the lexington corporate leaders trust fund contributed over million in net positive cash flow due primarily to its superior long term track record and the us equity markets 
although not as significant from a cash flow standpoint  the company enjoyed superior investment performance from a number of its other products  including the lexington gnma income fund number one fund among gnma funds tracked by lipper analytical services  inc and the lexington natural resources trust which was the number one natural resources fund in the variable insurance products category according to lipper analytical services  inc 
in contrast  the lexington worldwide emerging markets fund experienced net cash outflows of approximately million in due to lower quartile performance and a disaffection with emerging markets on the part of investors due to turmoil in the asian economies and capital markets 
the asian contagion significantly affected performance in a number of the company s mutual funds and was a contributing factor to net depreciation of billion for the mutual fund group as a whole 
in short  mutual fund asset growth amounted to billion and was comprised of net cash inflow of billion partially offset by net depreciation of billion 
total revenues of million are below when the company recorded revenues of million 
revenues from the west coast operations which were reorganized and partially disposed of in  amounted to million in and million in excluding the west coast operations  total revenues of million were million above the million recorded in net mutual fund management fees  the company s largest revenue source  increased approximately million to million in compared to million in these revenues increased as a result of the growth in mutual fund assets under management 
however  underlying the growth in assets under management is a shift in assets under management from some of the company s higher priced products emerging markets and precious metals to some of the lower priced products domestic equity and fixed income and to products with shared revenue arrangements sub advisory relationships 
this shift occurred as a result of relative investment performance and changing investor preferences which toward the end of the year favored us capital markets over some of the foreign markets  particularly the emerging markets 
mutual fund commissions of thousand were less than the thousand recorded in because sales of the company s two products with sales loads decreased as a result of declining investor interest in precious metals mutual funds 
other management fees of million are down million from million in the disposed west coast operations account for all of this decline 
similarly  commissions income declined to million in from million in as a result of the disposal of the west coast operations 
other income of million is million below the figure of million due to the weaker performance of some of the company s investments in the lexington funds which were adversely affected by the turmoil in the asian markets 
total expenses of million are million below total expenses of million in virtually all of the decline is attributable to the disposed and reorganized west coast operations which recorded total expenses of million in compared to million in the prior year period  offset by an increase of million of subadvisor fees due to the increase in assets under management with subadvisory agreements 
total personnel costs of million are million lower than the million recorded in a million decline in west coast personnel expenses was partially offset by a million increase in lmc s personnel costs  lmc added personnel to support and service its remaining west coast revenue stream 
in addition  the company recognized approximately  of expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock to certain key executive employees 
finally  employee benefits increased approximately million as a result of higher medical insurance premiums despite the company s switch to a different provider 
selling and promotional costs of million are million above the million in such costs in the prior year  reflecting lmc s greater advertising support behind several mutual funds with superior performance results 
in particular  the lexington troika dialog russia fund received significant support in the second half of as its performance placed the fund in the top five of the entire equity fund universe followed by lipper analytical services 
general and administrative costs of million are million above the prior year s figure of million 
the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in subadvisory fees 
the increase was due to an increase in assets under management with subadvisory agreements 
also contributing to the increase were higher administrative costs related to assets generated from its west coast operations and one time costs related to the termination of the company s former portfolio management system 
the company s new system is fully state of the art which includes compliance with the year data requirements 
offsetting the increase was a decrease in general and administrative costs attributable to the disposed west coast operations 
in addition  the company benefited from the absence of certain legal and audit fees associated with the company s reorganization which impacted the prior year results 
pre tax income amounted to million for and the provision for state and federal taxes remained relatively unchanged due to the comparable profit performance in and the company used approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards nols in and has remaining nols of approximately million which are available to offset future taxable income which expire over the period through overall  net income amounted to million or per share in compared to million  per share in effects of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on the operations of the company to date 
the company s assets consist primarily of cash and investments which are monetary in nature 
however  to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates with the attendant adverse effects on the securities markets and on the values of investments held in the company s accounts  inflation may adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
inflation also may result in increased operating expenses primarily personnel related costs that may not be readily recoverable in the fees charged by the company

this phase involves the replacement of certain systems with purchased software  the renovation of other systems  and the purchase of certain hardware and other devices  all of which are year compliant 
the company anticipates that the renovation phase related to these applications should be completed by the end of march  and that the validation phase should be completed by the end of april the implementation phase has commenced overlapping the validation phase with systems being installed at the completion of their validation testing

all outside vendors are in the validation phase 
the company expects to be year compliant during the second quarter of and is in the process of preparing a contingency plan  which should be completed by the second quarter of although the company believes it is adequately addressing its year issues  the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption in  or a failure of  certain normal business activities or operations 
such failure could materially affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition
