this new product development program peaked in with a record six new engine introductions 
while this investment in product development offers competitive advantages  it resulted in a temporary increase in product costs and a decrease in profitability in results of operations net sales in  the company achieved its seventh consecutive year of record sales  totaling billion 
revenues from sales of engines were percent of the company s net sales in  with engine revenues and unit shipments percent and percent higher  respectively  than in the company shipped a record  engines in  compared to  in and  in as follows unit shipments midrange engines    heavy duty engines    high horsepower engines    revenues from non engine products  which were percent of net sales in  were percent higher than in the major changes within non engine revenues were in filtration  with the sales of nelson included from the date of acquisition by cummins  and powercare which includes new parts and remanufactured engines and parts 
sales of the remaining non engine products  in the aggregate  were essentially level with the company s sales for each of its key segments during the last three years were millions automotive markets    industrial markets   engine business    power generation business    filtration business other  cummins engine business is the company s largest business segment  producing engines and parts for sale to customers in both automotive and industrial markets 
engine business customers are each serviced through the company s worldwide distributor network 
the engines are used in trucks of all sizes  buses and recreational vehicles  as well as a variety of industrial applications including construction  mining  agriculture  marine  rail and military

within the north american heavy duty truck market  unit shipments were up percent over  and cummins continued to be the market leader with a percent market share 
in  the company began limited production of the signature  a new electronic engine designed to capture a larger share of this market 
international unit shipments for the heavy duty market in were percent higher than in due to continued strong demand in european and mexican automotive markets 
revenues from the sales of engines for medium duty trucks in were percent lower than in on a percent decrease in units 
in north america  the company was affected by ford s relocation of its production facilities  partially offset by increased sales in international markets  primarily brazil

in january  cummins jointly announced with daimlerchrysler a new  fully electronic engine the isb for the dodge ram pickup

in  revenues from industrial markets were percent higher than in revenues from sales of engines decreased  while parts sales increased 
engine revenues in were percent lower than in on an percent increase in unit shipments 
the variance between revenues and units resulted from lower heavy duty and high horsepower engine sales and a shift in product mix of midrange engine sales 
the increased level of shipments was due to continued strong construction volumes in north america and europe  partially offset by declines in worldwide agricultural markets 
sales of engines and parts into the marine market in were percent lower than in  due primarily to the economic turmoil in asia 
sales into the mining market were percent lower than the prior year 
in  cummins announced an agreement with komatsu  a joint venture partner  to develop a liter engine targeted for the construction market  scheduled for release in the second half of revenues of billion in for power generation were percent higher than in and percent higher than in  with sales continuing to be impacted by the economic conditions in asia and lower sales in europe 
without the consolidation of cummins india limited  power generation sales would have decreased percent from sales of the company s generator sets continued to reflect growth in north america  which offset declines in demand for generator sets in asia 
engine sales to generator set assemblers were down percent from the prior year and sales of alternators were down percent  due primarily to lower demand in asia and the company s change in strategy  emphasizing sales of generator sets 
sales of small generator sets for recreational vehicles and other consumer markets remained strong in north america  increasing percent from sales of billion in for filtration and other were percent higher than in and percent higher than in  with nelson  acquired in january  contributing sales of million 
international distributor sales increased percent from due to the consolidation of cummins india limited in the fourth quarter of net sales by marketing territory for each of the last three years were millions united states    asia australia europe cis mexico latin america canada africa middle east in total  international markets accounted for percent of the company s revenues in europe and the cis  representing percent of the company s sales in  were percent lower than in and percent higher than in sales to canada  representing percent of sales in  were percent higher than in due to the acquisition of nelson and the relocation of certain customer production facilities

business in mexico and latin america  representing percent of sales  was percent higher than in  but began to decline in the latter part of sales to latin america  including brazil  represented percent of the company s sales in and were percent higher than in brazil individually accounted for percent of sales in the recent economic events in brazil have resulted in increased interest rates and devalued currencies in the region 
many of the company s customers are sensitive to interest rates  which will affect sales demand 
the devaluation of local currencies also could have an impact on operations  as certain of the company s transactions are based in brazilian currency  and could result in currency gains or losses 
sales to mexico  representing approximately percent of the company s sales in  could also potentially be affected by the economic uncertainty in brazil 
these events could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the company s business  however  the extent cannot be estimated reasonably based upon presently available information 
gross margin as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company recorded special charges in of million for product coverage costs and inventory write downs 
the product coverage special charges of million include million primarily attributable to base warranty costs and million for extended warranty programs 
these charges relate to a revised estimate of product coverage liability for engines manufactured in previous years 
the special charges recorded in also include million for inventory write downs associated with the company s restructuring and exit activities 
these write downs reflect amounts of inventory rendered excess or unusable due to the closing or consolidation of facilities 
the company s gross margin percentage before the product coverage and inventory special charges was percent in  compared to percent in and percent in the company s gross margin percentage declined due to a temporary increase in product coverage costs from isb and isc engines and higher new product costs attributable to the production ramp up of the isb  isc and signature engines 
this decrease was partially offset by the benefit from higher volume and pricing 
the acquisition of nelson and consolidation of cummins india limited added million 
gross margin percentage after the special charges was percent 
product coverage costs  excluding the special charges  were percent of net sales in  compared to percent in and percent in operating expenses selling and administrative expenses were percent of net sales in  compared to percent in and percent in on the percent sales increase in  these expenses  which include volume variable components  were up less than percent in absolute dollars 
net benefits of the company s cost reduction and restructuring actions were partially offset by increases in expenses associated with new product launches and information systems during research and engineering expenses were percent of net sales in  compared to percent in and percent in this is a result of a reduction in technical spending and certain product developments moving to the production stage 
the company s losses from joint ventures and alliances were million in  compared to income of million in the difference was due primarily to the consolidation of cummins india limited and losses at the company s joint venture with wartsila 
cummins wartsila is being affected by lower sales  primarily due to decreased demand in asia  and higher product coverage expenses 
in an effort to address the decline in the company s business in asia  to leverage overhead costs for all operations and to improve joint venture operating performance  the company established a restructuring program in as a result of this program  the company recorded a charge of million for costs to reduce the worldwide workforce by approximately  people  as well as costs associated with streamlining certain majority owned and international joint venture operations 
the charges for majority owned operations included million for severance and related costs associated with workforce reductions in the engine and power generation businesses  primarily for administrative positions 
the costs of these reductions were based on amounts pursuant to benefit programs and contractual provisions or statutory requirements at the affected operations 
approximately one half of these  employees left the company prior to december  an asset impairment loss of million  calculated according to the provisions of sfas no 
 was recorded primarily for engine manufacturing equipment to be disposed of upon the closure or consolidation of facilities or the outsource of production 
the recovery value for the equipment to be disposed of was based on estimated liquidation value 
the carrying value of assets held for disposal and the effect on earnings from suspending depreciation on such assets is immaterial 
facility consolidation and other costs of million included lease termination and facility exit costs of million  product support costs of million  and litigation and other costs of million 
as the restructuring consists primarily of the closing or consolidation of smaller operations  the company does not expect these actions to have a material effect on future revenues 
the charges for restructuring joint venture operations totaled million  the majority of which relates to actions being taken at the company s joint venture with wartsila  which is part of the company s power generation business 
the charges included million for employee severance and related benefits for approximately  people  million for a tax asset impairment loss and million for other facility and equipment related charges 
approximately million  primarily related to employee severance  has been charged to the restructuring liabilities as of december  of the total charges associated with restructuring activities  cash outlays will approximate million 
the program is expected to be essentially complete by the end of and yield approximately million in annual savings at completion 
in  the company recorded a charge of million for a civil penalty to be paid by the company as a result of an agreement reached with the us environmental protection agency  the department of justice and the california air resources board regarding diesel engine emissions 
in addition to the civil penalty  the agreement provides a schedule for diesel engines to meet certain emission standards and requires manufacturers to continue to invest in environmental projects to further reduce oxides of nitrogen nox emissions 
the company has developed extensive corporate action plans to comply with all aspects of the agreement 
additionally  three separate court actions have been filed as a result of allegations of the diesel emissions matter 
the new york supreme court ruled in favor of the company 
this matter is now on appeal 
a california state court recently ruled in favor of the company 
a recent action was just filed in the us district court  the district of columbia 
year the company continues to address the impact of the year issue on its businesses worldwide 
this issue affects computer systems that have date sensitive programs that may not properly recognize the year with respect to the company  this issue affects not only computer systems but also machinery and equipment used in production that may contain embedded computer technology 
following a review and assessment of information systems and technology used in its internal business operations and production  the company inventoried and identified those systems and products that the company believes may be vulnerable to year failures and established a program to address year issues 
the company s year efforts are being carried out by the company s year team under the leadership of the director of year compliance 
a year program office has been established at each of the company s facilities and is overseen by a year coordinator 
the year team maintains a reporting structure to ensure that progress is made and tracked on year issues 
in addition to internal resources  the company has retained external resources to assist with the implementation of its year program 
the company s program consists of the remediation  replacement or retirement of affected systems 
remediation is the alteration of a non compliant application to make it compliant  replacement is the substitution of a non compliant application with a compliant upgrade or product and retirement is the discarding of non compliant applications that have been determined to be dispensable 
the company completed a substantial portion of its remediation efforts and testing in  and expects to complete that process by the end of the second quarter of the year team will remain in place through january   and beyond as needed 
their role is to ensure that compliance is maintained once it is attained 
the company maintains contact with its key suppliers to obtain information relating to the status of such suppliers with respect to year issues  placing particular emphasis on determining the year readiness of its critical suppliers 
the company expects to incur total expenditures of approximately million in connection with its year program and remediation efforts 
to date  the company has incurred approximately million in costs relating to its year efforts 
there can be no assurances that the systems or products of third parties  which the company relies upon  will be timely converted or that a failure by a third party  or a conversion that is incompatible with the company s systems  would not have a material adverse effect on the company 
this is particularly true because the company utilizes sole suppliers for certain products 
the high level of skill and expertise required to develop certain components makes it impossible to change suppliers quickly 
the failure of a sole supplier may lead to a delay in production 
the company continues to develop contingency plans in the event that its operations are disrupted on january  such contingency plans include the stockpiling of certain business critical inventory  and identifying alternative suppliers where possible 
the estimated time of completion of the company s year program and compliance efforts  and the expenses related to the company s year compliance efforts are based upon management s best estimates  which were based on assumptions of future events  including the availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no assurances that these results and estimates will be achieved  and the actual results could materially differ from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability of personnel trained in this area and the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes 
other interest expense of million was million higher than in and million higher than in due to the increased level of borrowings to support working capital on the higher sales level and to complete the acquisition of nelson 
other income decreased million in as compared to the year ago period  primarily due to the nelson goodwill amortization and lower royalty income 
provision for income taxes the company s effective income tax rate normally is below the us federal corporate tax rate 
the lower tax rate is a result of tax benefits on export sales and tax credits on research expenses 
these benefits in were more than offset by the unfavorable tax effects of nondeductible losses in foreign joint ventures and nondeductible epa penalty and goodwill amortization 
the combined effect was a income tax provision of million 
cash flow and financial condition key elements of cash flows were millions net cash used in operating and investing activities net cash from financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash during  net cash used for operating and investing activities was million 
the higher level of net cash requirements in was due primarily to the acquisition of nelson  planned capital expenditures million in  compared to million in and million in for investments in new products and for working capital 
net working capital as a percent of sales was percent in  compared to percent in investments in joint ventures and alliances of million reflected the net effect of capital contributions and cash generated by certain joint ventures 
net cash provided from financing activities was million in as disclosed in note  the company issued million face amount of notes and debentures under a billion registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in december net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of nelson and pay down other indebtedness outstanding at december  based on the company s projected cash flow from operations and existing credit facilities  management believes that sufficient liquidity is available to meet anticipated capital and dividend requirements in the foreseeable future 
market risk the company is exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of derivative contracts 
as clearly stated in the company s policies and procedures  financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculating or for trading 
transactions are entered into only with banking institutions with strong credit ratings  and thus the credit risk associated with these contracts is considered immaterial 
hedging program results and status are reported to senior management on a periodic basis 
due to its international business presence  the company transacts extensively in foreign currencies 
as a result  corporate earnings experience some volatility related to movements in exchange rates 
in order to exploit the benefits of global diversification and naturally offsetting currency positions  foreign exchange balance sheet exposures are aggregated and hedged at the corporate level through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the objective of the foreign exchange hedging program is to reduce earnings volatility resulting from the translation of net foreign exchange balance sheet positions 
a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates would decrease earnings by approximately million 
this calculation does not reflect the impact of the gains and losses in the underlying exposures that would be offset  in part  by the results of the derivative instruments 
the sensitivity analysis also ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on cummins competitive position as well as the remoteness of the likelihood that all foreign currencies will move in tandem against the us dollar 
the company currently has in place an interest rate swap that effectively converts fixed rate debt into floating rate debt 
the objective of the swap is to lower the cost of borrowed funds 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the floating interest rate from the current level would correspond to a million increase in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
the company is exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers 
given the historically volatile nature of commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
the company uses commodity swap agreements to partially hedge exposures to changes in copper and aluminum prices 
the effect of a hypothetical depreciation of the underlying commodity price would be a loss of approximately million 
this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price changes in commodity costs
