competition commercial banking in texas is highly competitive  and bankshares  holding less than of deposits  represents only a minor segment of the industry 
to succeed in this industry  management believes that banks must have the capability to compete in the areas of i interest rates paid or charged  ii scope of services offered  and iii prices charged for such services 
the first financial banks compete in their respective service areas against highly competitive banks  savings and loan associations  small loan companies  credit unions  and brokerage firms  all of which are engaged in providing financial products and services and some of which are larger than the first financial banks in terms of capital  resources and personnel 
bankshares business does not depend on any single customer or any few customers  the loss of any one of which would have a materially adverse effect upon the business of bankshares 
customers of bankshares and its banks include their officers and directors  as well as other entities with which they are affiliated 
bankshares and its banks may make loans to officers and directors  and entities with which they are affiliated  in the ordinary course of business

employees bankshares and its banks employed approximately full time equivalent employees at march  management believes that its employee relations have been and will continue to be good 
supervision and regulation both federal and state laws extensively regulate bank holding companies and banks 
these laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder are primarily intended to protect depositors and the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic  although shareholders are also benefited 
the following information describes particular laws and regulatory provisions relating to bank holding companies and banks 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular laws and regulatory provisions 
a change in any of these laws or regulations may have a material effect on the business of bankshares and its banks 
bank holding companies because bankshares is a bank holding company  it is subject to regulation under the bhca and its examination and reporting requirements 
the bhca provides that bank holding companies may not engage in any activities other than banking  managing and controlling banks  furnishing services to a bank that it owns and controls  or engaging in certain activities closely related to banking 
examples of activities that the federal reserve board has determined to be closely related to banking  or to managing or controlling banks  include i the making or acquiring of loans or other extensions of credit  ii servicing of loans  iii performing certain trust functions  iv acting or serving as an investment or financial advisor  v providing certain securities brokerage services as agent for customers  and vi providing bookkeeping and data processing services for a bank holding company and its subsidiaries  or subject to certain limited exceptions directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than five percent of any class of voting shares or assets of any company  including a bank  without the prior written approval of the federal reserve board 
the bhca provides that the federal reserve board shall not approve any acquisition  merger or consolidation that may i substantially lessen competition in the banking industry  ii create a monopoly in any section of the country  or iii be a restraint of trade 
however  the federal reserve board may approve such a transaction if the convenience and needs of the community clearly outweigh any anti competitive effects 
specifically  the federal reserve board would consider  among other factors  the expected benefits to the public greater convenience  increased competition  greater efficiency  etc 
against the risks of possible adverse effects undue concentration of resources  decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest  unsound banking practices  etc also  see supervision and regulation capital for discussion of capital requirements of bank holding companies and bankshares support of the first financial banks for discussion of support requirements of bank holding companies

see supervision and regulation payment of dividends for discussion of restrictions on a bank s ability to pay dividends and supervision and regulation capital for discussion of capital requirements of banks 
deposit insurance each first financial bank is a member of the fdic 
the fdic provides deposit insurance protection that covers all deposit accounts in fdic insured depository institutions and that does not exceed  per account 
the first financial banks must pay assessments to the fdic under a risk based assessment system for federal deposit insurance protection 
fdic insured depository institutions that are members of the bank insurance fund pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification 
institutions assigned to higher risk classifications ie  institutions that pose a greater risk of loss to their respective deposit insurance funds pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk 
an institution s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to bank regulators 
in addition  the fdic can impose special assessments to cover the costs of borrowings from the us treasury  the federal financing bank and the bank insurance fund member banks 
as of december   the assessment rate for each of the first financial banks is at the lowest level risk based premium available 
under the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of the firrea  an fdic insured depository institution can be held liable for any losses incurred by the fdic in connection with i the default of one of its fdic insured subsidiaries or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to one of its fdic insured subsidiaries in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver  and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
the federal deposit insurance act the fdia requires that the fdic review i any merger or consolidation by or with an insured bank  or ii any establishment of branches by an insured bank 
the fdic is also empowered to regulate interest rates paid by insured banks 
approval of the fdic is also required before an insured bank retires any part of its common or preferred stock  or any capital notes or debentures 
insured banks that are also members of the federal reserve system  however  are regulated with respect to the foregoing matters by the federal reserve system 
payment of dividends bankshares is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries 
bankshares receives most of its revenues from dividends paid to it by its delaware holding company subsidiary 
similarly  the delaware holding company subsidiary receives dividends from its bank subsidiaries 
described below are some of the laws and regulations that apply when the subsidiary banks and bankshares pay dividends 
each state bank that is a member of the federal reserve system and each national banking association is required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the occ  respectively  to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of i such bank s net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii its retained net profits as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two calendar years  less any required transfers to surplus 
in addition  these banks may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits including the portion transferred to surplus exceed bad debts as defined by regulation 
the first financial banks paid aggregate dividends of approximately million in and approximately million in under the dividend restrictions discussed above  as of december   the first financial banks  without obtaining governmental approvals  could have declared in the aggregate additional dividends of approximately million from retained net profits 
to pay dividends  bankshares and its banks also must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines 
in addition  if the applicable regulatory authority believes that a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the bank  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such bank cease and desist from such practice 
the federal reserve board and the occ have each indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic have issued policy statements that recommend that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings 
affiliate transactions the federal reserve act and the fdia restrict the extent to which bankshares can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from  or engage in certain other transactions with  its depository subsidiaries 
these laws regulate covered transactions between insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries  on the one hand  and their nondepository affiliates  on the other hand 
covered transactions include a loan or extension of credit to a nondepository affiliate  a purchase of securities issued by such an affiliate  a purchase of assets from such an affiliate unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve board  an acceptance of securities issued by such an affiliate as collateral for a loan  and an issuance of a guarantee  acceptance  or letter of credit for the benefit of such an affiliate 
the covered transactions that an insured depository institution and its subsidiaries are permitted to engage in with their nondepository affiliates are limited to the following amounts i in the case of any one such affiliate  the aggregate amount of covered transactions cannot exceed ten percent of the capital stock and the surplus of the insured depository institution  and ii in the case of all affiliates  the aggregate amount of covered transactions cannot exceed twenty percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution 
in addition  extensions of credit that constitute covered transactions must be collateralized in prescribed amounts 
further  a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property or furnishing of services 
capital bank holding companies 
the federal reserve board has adopted risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
the ratio of total capital total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit must be a minimum of eight percent 
at least half of the total capital is to be composed of common shareholders equity  minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill tier capital 
the remainder of total capital may consist of subordinated debt  other preferred stock and a limited amount of loan loss reserves 
in addition  the federal reserve board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating  must maintain a minimum tier capital leverage ratio tier capital to average assets for the current quarter  less goodwill of three percent 
bank holding companies that do not have the highest regulatory rating will generally be required to maintain a higher tier capital leverage ratio of three percent plus an additional cushion of to basis points 
the federal reserve board has not advised bankshares of any specific minimum leverage ratio applicable to it 
the guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions 
such strong capital positions must be kept substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets eg  goodwill  core deposit intangibles and purchased mortgage servicing rights 
as of december   the capital ratios for bankshares were as follows tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio   total capital to risk weighted assets ratio   and tier capital leverage ratio  
banks 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of the fdicia established five capital tiers with respect to depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier will depend upon where its capital levels are in relation to various relevant capital measures  including i risk based capital measures  ii a leverage ratio capital measure and iii certain other factors 
regulations establishing the specific capital tiers provide that a well capitalized institution will have a total risk based capital ratio of ten percent or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of six percent or greater  and a tier leverage ratio of five percent or greater  and not be subject to any written regulatory enforcement agreement  order  capital directive or prompt corrective action derivative 
for an institution to be adequately capitalized  it will have a total risk based capital ratio of eight percent or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of four percent or greater  and a tier leverage ratio of four percent or greater in some cases three percent 
for an institution to be undercapitalized  it will have a total risk based capital ratio that is less than eight percent  a tier risk based capital ratio less than four percent or a tier leverage ratio less than four percent or a leverage ratio less than three percent if the institution is rated composite in its most recent report of examination  subject to appropriate federal banking agency guidelines 
for an institution to be significantly undercapitalized  it will have a total risk based capital ratio less than six percent  a tier risk based capital ratio less than three percent  or a tier leverage ratio less than three percent 
for an institution to be critically undercapitalized  it will have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than two percent 
the fdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action against depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
under current regulations  the first financial banks were well capitalized as of december  the fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
an undercapitalized institution must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that institution s compliance with such plan 
the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the institution s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards 
furthermore  in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company  such guarantee would take priority over the parent s general unsecured creditors 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan  it shall be treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
finally  the fdicia requires the various regulatory agencies to set forth certain standards that do not relate to capital 
such standards relate to the safety and soundness of operations and management and to asset quality and executive compensation  and permit regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards 
if an insured bank fails to meet its capital guidelines  it may be subject to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including a prohibition on the taking of brokered deposits and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic 
bank regulators continue to indicate their desire to raise capital requirements beyond their current levels 
in addition to the fdicia capital standards  texas chartered banks must also comply with the capital requirements imposed by the texas banking department 
neither the texas finance code nor its regulations specify any minimum capital to assets ratio that must be maintained by a texas chartered bank 
instead  the texas banking department determines the appropriate ratio on a bank by bank basis  considering factors such as the nature of a bank s business  its total revenue  and the bank s total assets 
as of december   all texas chartered banks owned by bankshares exceeded the minimum ratios applied to them 
bankshares support of the first financial banks under federal reserve board policy  bankshares is expected to commit resources to support each of its subsidiary banks 
this support may be required at times when  absent such federal reserve board policy  bankshares would not otherwise be required to provide it 
in addition  any loans by bankshares to its banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of its banks 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and be subject to a priority of payment 
under the national bank act  if the capital stock of a national bank is impaired by losses or otherwise  the occ is authorized to require the bank s shareholders to pay the deficiency on a pro rata basis 
if any shareholder refuses to pay the pro rata assessment after three months notice  then the bank s board of directors must sell an appropriate amount of such shareholder s stock at a public auction to make up the deficiency 
to the extent necessary  if a deficiency in capital still exist and the bank refuses to go into liquidation  then a receiver may be appointed to wind up the bank s affairs 
interstate banking and branching act pursuant to the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking and branching act  a bank holding company is able to acquire banks in states other than its home state 
prior to september   federal law provided that the federal reserve board could only approve interstate acquisitions by bank holding companies that were specifically authorized by the laws of the state in which the bank whose shares were to be acquired was located 
the interstate banking and branching act also authorized banks to merge across state lines  thereby creating interstate branches  beginning june  under this act  each state had the opportunity to opt out of this provision  thereby prohibiting interstate branching in such states  or to opt in at an earlier time  thereby allowing interstate branching within that state prior to june  furthermore  pursuant to this act  a bank is now able to open new branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations  if the laws of such state permit it to do so 
although texas has adopted legislation to opt out of the interstate branching provisions  which legislation expires on september   recent judicial decisions have invalidated this opt out legislation 
both the occ and the texas banking department are presently accepting applications for interstate merger and branching transactions 
the texas banking department intends to submit proposed legislation that would codify the judicial authority for interstate merger and branching transactions to the texas legislature during the legislative session 
community reinvestment act of the community reinvestment act of the cra subjects a bank to regulatory assessment to determine if the institution meets the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods served by the bank  and to take that determination into account in its evaluation of any application made by such bank for  among other things  approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility  an office relocation  a merger  or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution 
the regulatory authority prepares a written evaluation of an institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community and assigns a rating 
the first financial banks have taken significant actions to comply with the cra  and each has received at least a satisfactory commendation in its most recent review by federal regulators with respect to its compliance with the cra 
both the united states congress and the banking regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the cra and fair lending laws  rules and regulations  and there can be no certainty as to the effect  if any  that any such changes would have on the first financial banks 
monetary policy banks are affected by the credit policies of other monetary authorities  including the federal reserve board  that affect the national supply of credit 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of credit in order to influence general economic conditions  primarily through open market operations in united states government obligations  varying the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  varying reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and restricting certain borrowings by financial institutions and their subsidiaries 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
pending and proposed legislation proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood and timing of any such proposals or bills being enacted and the impact they might have on bankshares and its banks cannot be determined at this time

net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on liabilities incurred to fund those assets 
the company s earning assets consist primarily of loans and securities 
the company s liabilities to fund those assets consist primarily of interest bearing deposits 
net interest income was million in as compared to million in and million in these increases were primarily due to growth in the volume of earning assets 
average earning assets were billion in  an increase of million  or  as compared to billion in  which was million  or  higher than the increase is due primarily to the tcb san angelo acquisition which accounted for approximately million of such increase

at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets of thousand and million  respectively 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of the recorded valuation allowance  will be realized in the future because of the recent history of taxable income generated by the company and the subsidiary bank to which the net operating loss carryforward relates 
on a consolidated basis  taxable income for the company was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of the net operating loss carryforward is conditioned upon taxable income generated by the subsidiary bank which originally incurred operating losses 
the net operating loss carryforward was acquired in the purchase of the stock of the subsidiary bank  and under applicable internal revenue service regulations regarding change of control  its usage is limited to a predetermined amount in each future period 
the net operating loss carryforward approximates million at december   with a usage limitation of thousand per year 
the net operating loss carryforward expires in the years through taxable income generated by the subsidiary bank before the net operating loss carryforward was approximately million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company established a valuation allowance for the net operating loss carryforward because full utilization of this carryforward depends on future taxable income in years when the company is unable to determine that it is more likely than not that taxable income of the subsidiary bank will be available 
balance sheet review loans 
the loan portfolio is comprised of loans made to businesses  individuals  and farm and ranch operations located in the primary trade areas served by the company s subsidiary banks 
real estate loans represent loans primarily for new home construction and owner occupied real estate 
the structure of loans in the real estate mortgage classification generally provides repricing intervals to minimize the interest rate risk inherent in fixed rate mortgage loans 
as of december   total loans were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to december  real estate loans and consumer loans as of december   increased million and million  respectively  as compared to december  commercial  financial and agricultural loans as of december   were million  a decrease of million as compared to december  a million reduction in agricultural loans  which was due primarily to unfavorable weather conditions and lower cattle prices  was a primary factor in this decrease

the allowance for loan losses is the amount deemed by management as of a specific date to be adequate to provide for possible losses on loans that may become uncollectible 
management determines the allowance and the required provision expense by reviewing general loss experiences and the performances of specific credits 
the provision for loan losses was million for and as compared to million for as a percent of average loans  net loan charge offs were

during this increase was primarily due to the company experiencing increased net loan losses from consumer loans  which to a large extent related to indirect automobile loans 
as a consequence  the company s subsidiary banks active in indirect automobile lending took steps to upgrade the credit quality of the indirect automobile loan portfolios 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans was as of december   as compared to as of december  management anticipates that the ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans will remain above in future periods 
a key indicator of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans  which consist of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days  and restructured loans

interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
the company uses no off balance sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
each subsidiary bank has an asset liability committee that monitors interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies 
each subsidiary bank tracks interest rate risk by  among other things  interest sensitivity gap and simulation analysis 
table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities as of december   and sets forth the repricing dates of the company s consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as the company s consolidated interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
the table is based upon assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment 
these assumptions are estimates made by management 
assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures

management estimates that  as of december  and december   an upward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in an increase of projected net interest income of and  respectively  and a downward shift of interest rates by basis points would result in a reduction in projected net interest income of and  respectively 
these are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at each year end will remain constant over the relevant twelve month measurement period and that changes in market interest rates are instantaneous and sustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
also  this analysis does not contemplate any actions that the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
in management s belief  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually could occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude 
management believes that it is unlikely that such changes would occur in a short time period 
as interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice at different time frames and proportions to market interest rate movements  various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion 
since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions  the company s future results would  in management s belief  be different from the foregoing estimates  and such results could be material 
liquidity 
liquidity is the ability of the company to meet cash demands as they arise 
such needs can develop from loan demand  deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets  which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  federal funds sold  and short term investments in time deposits in banks 
liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources  which include core depositors and correspondent banks that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to subsidiary banks of the company 
given the strong core deposit base and relatively low loan deposit ratios maintained at the subsidiary banks  management considers the current liquidity position to be adequate to meet short term liquidity needs 
parent company funding 
the company s ability to fund various operating expenses  dividends  and cash acquisitions is generally dependent on company only earnings  cash reserves and funds derived from its subsidiary banks 
these funds historically have been produced by intercompany dividends and management fees that are limited to reimbursement of actual expenses 
the company anticipates that its recurring cash sources will continue to include dividends and management fees from subsidiary banks 
at december   approximately million was available for the payment of intercompany dividends by the subsidiary banks without the prior approval of regulatory agencies 
also at december   the company had million available under a line of credit with an unaffiliated financial institution 
dividends 
the company s long term dividend policy is to pay cash dividends to its shareholders of between and of its net earnings while maintaining adequate capital to support growth 
the dividend payout ratios have amounted to  and of net earnings  respectively  in  and on december   the company paid a stock dividend of one share of its common stock for every ten shares of its common stock outstanding to shareholders of record as of the close of business on november   which will result in a increase in the company s current quarterly dividend 
year the year issue is a programming issue that may affect many electronic processing systems 
until recently  in order to minimize the length of data fields  most date sensitive programs eliminated the first two digits of the year 
this issue could affect information technology it systems and date sensitive embedded technology that controls certain systems such as telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
leaving them unable to properly recognize or distinguish dates in the twentieth and twenty first centuries and thereafter 
for example  date sensitive calculations may treat as the year rather than the year this treatment could result in significant miscalculations when processing critical date sensitive information relating to dates after december  the company has completed its initial year compliance assessment of its core it systems  which include loan  deposit and check processing systems 
these core it systems are licensed from third parties  and these third parties have warranted to the company that their system is year compliant 
the company completed compliance testing of these core it systems during the quarter ended december  the company believes that the results of its tests were successful and that these results showed that these core it systems are year compliant 
these results were reviewed and confirmed by an independent third party that is competent in year compliance testing hired by the company 
the company believes that  based on these results and the warranties provided by the third parties that licensed these core it systems to the company  these core it systems are year compliant 
the company has also completed its initial year compliance assessment of its other it systems  which includes automatic teller machine software systems 
these other it systems are also licensed from third parties 
these third parties have either assured the company that their system is year compliant or identified necessary system upgrades to make their system year compliant 
the company currently anticipates receiving the necessary systems upgrades and completing year compliance testing of these other it systems by june  there can be no assurance that these other it systems will be year compliant by december  if any of these other it systems are not year compliant by december   then the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the operations  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the year issue may also affect the company s date sensitive embedded technology which controls systems such as the telecommunications systems  security systems  etc 
the company does not believe that the cost to modify or replace such technology to make it year compliant will be material 
but  if such modifications or replacements  if required  are not made  the year issue could have a material adverse effect on the operations  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
ultimately  the potential impact of the year issue will depend not only on the corrective measures the company undertakes  but also on the way in which the year issue is addressed by governmental agencies  businesses and other entities that provide data to  or receive data from  the company or any of its subsidiaries  or whose financial condition or operations are important to the company or any of its subsidiaries  such as bank regulatory agencies  the federal reserve banking system  and significant suppliers and customers 
the company is in communication with significant customers and vendors to evaluate the risk of their failure to be year compliant and the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to such failure 
there can be no assurance that the systems of these third parties will be year compliant by december   or that the failure of these third parties to be year compliant will not have a material adverse effect on the operations  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the cost of it and embedded technology systems testing and upgrades is not expected to be material to the company s consolidated operating results 
the company estimates the cost of testing  communication programs  and other related items to be thousand  with thousand having been incurred and recorded as noninterest expense during the company also estimates the total cost of system upgrades to make certain systems year compliant to be approximately million  thousand of which has been incurred through december   and which will be capitalized and amortized over future periods 
all of these costs have been and will continue to be funded with cash from operations 
although the company believes that its core it systems are year compliant  it has not developed a reasonably likely worst case year scenario because testing of the company s other it systems has not yet been completed  the company has not yet identified all embedded technology that needs modification and replacement  and the company has not received assurances from all of its significant customers and vendors regarding their year compliance 
the company has  however  developed some contingency plans for year noncompliance 
as a matter of course  the company will compile hard copy of data on its core it systems as of december  if any of the company s core it systems or other it systems fail because they are not year compliant  the company including its subsidiary banks intends to revert to a manual system of tracking and accounting for the data that was formerly tracked or accounted for by such system 
the company will manually recreate a history of the subject data eg  a customer s deposit  checking or loan history  an investment portfolio history  or a financial accounting history from the present back to a point in time when the company believes it has reasonably reliable and supportable subject data  which should be december  then  the company will manually track and record such subject data until the related it system becomes year compliant and is reasonably tested for such compliance 
at that point  the company will transfer the manually tracked subject data to such system and continue tracking on such system 
in addition  if any of the telecommunications systems between the company and its subsidiary banks fail because they are not year compliant  the company and its subsidiary banks will manually print and timely physically deliver the data normally transferred through its telecommunications systems 
finally  the company will shut down all automatic teller machines if any of the it systems associated therewith fail due to year noncompliance 
the company s plans are not comprehensive and do not address all year contingencies  including contingencies for year noncompliance by the company s embedded technology or the systems of governmental agencies  significant customers or significant vendors 
also  there can be no assurance that the company s contingency plans will prevent the company from suffering a material adverse effect on its operations  financial condition or results of operations if any of its core it systems  other it systems or embedded technology or any systems of a governmental agency  a significant customer or significant vendor prove not to be year compliant
