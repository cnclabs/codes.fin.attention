we assume no obligation to update our forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
horizon s principal business strategy since commencing operations in has been to establish a chain of retail pharmacies through the acquisition of full line retail pharmacies 
in evaluating a retail pharmacy for potential acquisition  we i evaluate the target store s profits and losses for preceding years  ii review the store s tax returns for preceding years  iii review computer generated prescription reports showing historical information including prescriptions sold  average price of each prescription  gross margins and trends in prescription sales  iv analyze the store s location and competition in the immediate area  v review the store s lease agreement  if any  and vi assess targeted areas for growth patterns and trends 
based on our analysis of the foregoing items  we prepare an offer to purchase the particular store 
to assess the reasonableness of the purchase price offered by a seller in connection with a potential acquisition  we consider the availability and terms of owner financing of approximately one third of the purchase price  including such terms as rate of return and payback period  with the balance split between cash and other consideration such as our common stock 
in  and we acquired six  and retail pharmacies or related businesses  respectively 
these acquisitions are the principal influence on our results of operations and financial condition 
the primary measurement of the effect of acquisitions on our operating performance is the number of store operating months  which is the number of months we owned all of the stores counted during the relevant measuring period 
we expect that ongoing acquisitions will be the most significant factor in our growth strategy 
currently  our primary source of revenue is the sale of prescription drugs 
during  sales of prescription drugs generated of our net revenues  during  prescription drug sales generated of revenues and during  such sales generated of revenues 
we expect our prescription drug business to continue to increase on an annual basis as a result of the demographic trends toward an aging population and the continued development of new pharmaceutical products 
however  we anticipate that such sales will decrease as a percentage of our total net revenues and gross margins as we expand our home healthcare and other non pharmaceutical sales and services which have historically generated higher margins 
our revenues and profits are higher during peak holiday periods and from christmas through easter 
sales of health related products peak during seasonal outbreaks of cough and cold flu viruses  which typically occur during the winter and spring 
accordingly  revenues and profits are typically highest in the first and fourth quarters of each year

net revenues 
our total net revenues increased  or  to  in compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to the increase in store operating months from in fiscal and in fiscal to in fiscal prescription drug sales increased by  or to  or fiscal compared to  for fiscal and  for third party reimbursed sales accounted for approximately of our total prescription sales in  as compared to in and in higher reimbursement sales have typically resulted in a decrease in gross margins due to the lower prices negotiated by third party payors 
this decrease was partially offset  however  by our management of inventory levels and purchasing controls  which resulted in a slight margin percentage increase in and in  the gross margin on prescription drug sales was down significantly due to unanticipated problems with our communications technology which prevented us from receiving daily updates of average wholesale pharmaceutical prices 
the following tables show our prescription drug gross margins and total sales margins for  and gross margins on prescription drug sales gross margins on total revenues year amount percentage amount percentage sales of prescription drugs decreased from of total revenues for to of total revenues for and of total revenues for we expect that prescription drug sales will continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we expand our home healthcare and other non pharmaceutical sales and services  whose gross margins exceed those of pharmaceutical sales 
same store sales for our first stores increased from  in to  in  an increase of 
same store sales on our first stores increased from  in to  in  an increase of 
management believes that these increases are primarily the result of increased advertising and promotions as well as an enhanced product mix 
we currently have non compete agreements with the previous owners of all of the stores we have acquired except for the marion and covington  virginia stores  which were acquired from the federal trade commission  and three stores located in mineola  mt 
vernon and mckinney  texas  which we acquired from true quality pharmacies  inc costs and expenses 
cost of sales increased  or to  in as compared to  in and  in this increase is primarily the result of increased sales volume due to the increased number of store operating months for the respective periods 
total cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues decreased from to and increased by from to this increase in cost of goods was caused by unexpected communications technology problems in receiving updated pricing information from our primary supplier during the last quarter of as a result our prescription prices to third party and cash customers were not increased when our cost of those prescription products increased 
the problem was identified in february of and corrected in march of by switching to another provider of updated pricing information 
as a result our gross margin on prescription drug sales declined from in and in to in  with a significant portion of the decline attributable to the failure to receive updated pricing and the balance due to an increase in prescriptions reimbursed through third party providers 
the increase of  in selling  general and administrative expenses from  in and  in to  in is principally due to increased store count and resulting increased store operating months 
such expenses  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  were for and and for and  respectively 
these increases in expenses as a percentage of net revenues were primarily due to an increase in personnel 
depreciation and amortization expense was in compared to in and in the increase primarily resulted from our acquisition of stores in and intangible assets  including but not limited to goodwill  pharmacy files and non compete covenants  have historically represented a substantial portion of our acquisition costs 
such assets are amortized over a period of not more than years 
accordingly  intangible assets are not expected to have a significant effect on our future results of operations 
interest expense was in compared to in and in the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from the increase in our indebtedness associated with the acquisition of stores in and earnings 
income loss before provision credit for income taxes decreased from of net revenues in and of net revenues in  to a loss of  of net revenues in  an increase of of net revenues and a decrease of  of net revenues  respectively 
because horizon operated as an s corporation prior to its initial public offering  it had not incurred any income taxes prior to such time 
as a result of the termination of its s corporation election in connection with the initial public offering  we became a taxpaying entity subject to the payment of taxes on all non exempt income at applicable federal and state income tax rates 
in  we incurred a noncash one time charge for deferred income taxes of as a result of the change in tax status 
in we incurred a net loss of  as compared to net income of after the one time noncash charge for deferred taxes of in and net income of in the loss in resulted primarily from profits which were lost when our computer system failed to receive and or process daily price updates on prescription drugs transmitted electronically from our wholesale supplier 
liquidity and capital resources 
net cash used in operating activities was  in as compared to in and provided by operations in the net loss of  in was primarily responsible for the increase in net cash used by operations 
typically  cash provided by operations is adequate to supply working capital and external sources of cash are used mainly to finance new store acquisitions 
we believe that our working capital needs  including growth in accounts receivable and inventory will be funded by cash flow from operations 
new store acquisitions and other capital expenditures will be funded by the mckesson credit facility and capital leases 
the  net proceeds of a private placement closed june  was used to support an aggressive store acquisition program and for working capital 
we believe that based on prior acquisitions  the average acquisition cost per store will be approximately to plus inventory based on such variables as store sales and profits 
management believes it will be able to obtain seller financing for approximately of the cost of each such acquisition 
mckesson currently provides us with a  credit facility  subject to certain restrictive covenants including financial ratio requirements which we must meet to maintain the credit facility 
at december  we were in default of several of these covenants  but mckesson waived such defaults pursuant to an agreement executed april  at december   we had borrowed  under this credit facility 
during january  we acquired four additional stores  however  as a result of the loss incurred in  we temporarily suspended acquisitions 
we plan to resume acquisitions in the latter part of the second quarter or the third quarter 
during we expect to fund such acquisitions with the existing credit facility  seller financing  cash flow from operations  the issuance of a limited number of restricted shares of common stock  and possibly another acquisition line of credit or equity offering 
thereafter we expect to fund acquisitions with cash flow from current operations  seller financing  and the public or private offering of certain equity or long term debt securities 
because of the federal moratorium on home healthcare licenses from september to january  and the uncertainty of the current regulations  we do not plan to expand our home healthcare operations in we expect  however  to offer home medical equipment through stores which have not heretofore offered such equipment 
impact of inflation and changing prices 
inflation continues to cause increases in product  occupancy and operating expenses  as well as the cost of acquiring capital assets 
the effect of higher operating costs is minimized by achieving operating efficiencies 
factors affecting operations 
dependence on acquisitions for growth 
our growth strategy depends upon our ability to continue to acquire  consolidate and operate existing free standing pharmacies and related businesses on a profitable basis 
we continually review acquisition proposals and are currently engaged in discussions with third parties with respect to possible acquisitions 
we compete for acquisition candidates with buyers who have greater financial and other resources and may be able to pay higher acquisition prices than we are able to pay 
to the extent we are unable to acquire suitable retail pharmacies  or to successfully integrate such stores into our operations  our ability to expand our business will be reduced significantly 
sales to third party payors 
we sell a growing percentage of our prescription drugs to customers who are covered by third party payment programs 
although contracts with third party payors may increase the volume of prescription sales and gross profits  third party payors typically negotiate lower prescription prices than non third party payors 
accordingly  gross profit margins on sales of prescription drugs have been decreasing and are expected to continue to decrease in future periods 
reliance on medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
substantially all of our home healthcare revenues are attributable to third party payors  including medicare and medicaid  private insurers  managed care plans and hmos 
the amounts we receive from government programs and private third party payors are dependent upon the specific benefits included under the program or the patient s insurance policies 
any substantial delays in reimbursement or significant reductions in the coverage or payment rates of third party payors  or from patients enrolled in the medicare or medicaid programs  would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
expansion 
our ongoing expansion will require us to implement and integrate enhanced operational and financial systems  and additional management  operational and financial resources 
our inability to implement and integrate these systems and or add these resources could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
there can be no assurance we will be able to manage our expanding operations effectively or maintain or accelerate our growth 
although we experienced growth in net sales in  and  and increased profits in and  we sustained a substantial loss in as a result of the malfunction of our computerized pricing system which failed to receive and or integrate average wholesale price updates electronically transmitted from our primary supplier 
while such malfunction has been corrected  there can be no assurance we will not experience other such problems related to expansion or that we will be able to maintain or increase net revenues 
government regulation and healthcare reform 
pharmacists and pharmacies are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations  and may be adversely affected by certain changes in such regulations 
in addition  prescription drug sales represent a significant portion of our revenues and profits  and are a significant segment of our business 
these revenues are affected by regulatory changes  including changes in programs providing for reimbursement of the cost of prescription drugs by third party payment plans  such as government and private plans  and regulatory changes relating to the approval process for prescription drugs 
regulation of home healthcare services 
our home healthcare business is subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws could have a material effect on permissible activities  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement for our products and services paid by government and other third party payors 
malpractice liability 
the provision of retail pharmacy and home healthcare services entails an inherent risk of claims of medical and professional malpractice liability 
we may be named as a defendant in such malpractice lawsuits and subject to the attendant risk of substantial damage awards 
while we believe we have adequate professional and medical malpractice liability insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that we will not be sued  that any such lawsuit will not exceed our insurance coverage  or that we will be able to maintain such coverage at acceptable costs and on favorable terms 
competition 
the retail pharmacy and home healthcare businesses are highly competitive 
we compete with national  regional and local retail pharmacy chains  independent retail pharmacies  deep discount retail pharmacies  supermarkets  discount department stores  mass merchandisers and other retail stores and mail order operations 
similarly  our home healthcare operations compete with other larger providers of home healthcare services including chain operations and independent single unit stores which are more established in that market and which offer more extensive home healthcare services than we offer 
most of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours  and we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to successfully compete with such competitors 
geographic concentration 
currently  and of our retail pharmacies are located in texas and new mexico  respectively  and we plan to acquire other retail pharmacies located in such states 
consequently  our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon general trends in the texas and new mexico economies and any significant healthcare legislative proposals enacted in those states 
substantial indebtedness 
we have incurred substantial debt and may incur additional indebtedness in the future in connection with our plan of acquisitions 
our ability to make cash payments to satisfy our debt will depend upon our future operating performance  which is subject to a number of factors including prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to service such debt we may have to refinance certain of these obligations or dispose of certain assets 
in the event we are required to refinance all or any part of such debt  there can be no assurance that we will be able to effect such refinancing on satisfactory terms 
possible need for additional capital 
we believe the proceeds from the private placement  operating revenues and the mckesson credit facility will be adequate to satisfy our capital requirements for the next months  although circumstances  including the acquisition of additional stores  may require that we obtain additional long or short term financing to realize certain business opportunities 
no assurance can be made that we will be able to obtain such financing 
reliance on single supplier 
we currently purchase approximately of our inventory from mckesson  which also provides us with order entry machines  shelf labels and other supplies 
we believe that the wholesale pharmaceutical and non pharmaceutical distribution industry is highly competitive because of the consolidation of the retail pharmacy industry and the practice of certain large retail pharmacy chains to purchase directly from product manufacturers 
although we believe we could obtain our inventory through another distributor at competitive prices and upon competitive payment terms if our relationship with mckesson was terminated  there can be no assurance that the termination of such relationship would not adversely affect our business 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results  seasonality 
our results of operations depend significantly upon the net sales generated during the first and fourth quarters  and any decrease in net sales for such periods could have a material adverse effect upon our profitability 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not and will not necessarily be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
year the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of our computer programs or hardware that have date sensitive software or embedded computer chips may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations which could disrupt our normal business activities 
we have established a plan to prepare our systems for the year issue and to reasonably assure that our critical business partners are prepared 
we have completed our assessment of all internal systems that could be significantly affected by the year issue and have determined that we will be required to modify or replace portions of our software primarily related to our accounting and pharmacy systems 
we believe that with modifications or replacements of the identified software programs  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if all additional phases of the year plan are not completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on our operations as discussed under risks and contingency plans 
in addition  we are in the process of gathering information about the year compliance status of our key third party business partners 
status 
our internal information technology exposures are primarily related to four areas i our financial accounting system  ii our management information systems comprising primarily stand alone pcs  iii our pharmacy system used in connection with the dispensation of pharmaceuticals  and iv our point of sale system for our automated cash registers 
as of december   we had completed upgrading our accounting and management informations systems  and we expect to complete software reprogramming and replacement for the pharmacy and point of sale systems no later than june  once the software is reprogrammed or replaced with a year compliant version  we will test and implement the software 
as of december   we had completed of our testing and had implemented of our remediated applications 
completion of the testing phase for all significant systems is expected by june  with all remediated systems fully tested and implemented by june  our non information technology systems consist primarily of miscellaneous office equipment which is not material to our business 
the initial assessment of these systems has indicated that modification or replacement will not be necessary as a result of the year issue 
as such  we are not currently remediating this operating equipment 
however  the existence of embedded technology is by nature more difficult to identify 
while we believe that all significant non information technology systems are year compliant  we plan to continue testing our operating equipment and expect to complete the testing by september  significant third parties 
our significant third party business partners consist of our suppliers  banks and third party insurance carriers 
an initial inventory of significant suppliers and banks has been completed and letters mailed requesting information regarding each parties year compliance status 
we intend to develop contingency plans by july  for suppliers that appear to have substantial year operational risks which may include the change of suppliers to minimize such risks 
we will continue our efforts to raise awareness and inform store managers of the risks posed by the year throughout fiscal year costs 
our year plan encompasses the use of both internal and external resources to identify  remediate  test  and implement systems for year readiness 
external resources include contract resources which will be used to supplement available internal resources 
the total cost of the year project  excluding internal personnel costs  is estimated at  and is being funded by operating cash flows 
as of december   we had incurred expenses of related to the year project 
of the total remaining project costs  approximately  is attributable to the purchase and implementation of new hardware and software and will be capitalized 
the remaining relates to remediation and testing of software and will be expensed as incurred 
risks and contingency plans 
we believe we have an effective plan in place to resolve the year issue in a timely manner 
however  due to the forward looking nature and lack of historical experience with year issues  it is difficult to predict with certainty what will happen after december  despite the year remediation efforts being made  it is likely that there will be disruptions and unexpected business problems during the early months of we plan to make diligent efforts to assess the year readiness of our significant business partners and will develop contingency plans for critical areas where we believe our exposure to year risk is the greatest 
however  despite our efforts  we may encounter unanticipated third party failures  more general public infrastructure failures or a failure to successfully conclude our remediation efforts as planned 
if the remaining year plan is not completed timely  in addition to the implications noted above  we may be required to utilize manual processing of certain otherwise automated processes primarily related to partner compensation and cash management 
any one of these unforeseen events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows in and beyond 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of our outstanding line of credit 
the balance outstanding under the line of credit was  at december  the impact on our results of operations of a one point interest rate change on balances outstanding under the line of credit would be immaterial 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets
