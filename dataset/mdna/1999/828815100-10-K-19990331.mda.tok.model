impact of the year issue general the year issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices or engage in similar normal business activities 
based on an assessment conducted in  the company determined that it was necessary to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  to address these problems  the company initiated a year compliance program which is described below 
the company does not anticipate that the addressing of the year problem for its internal information systems and current and future products will have a material impact on its operations or financial results 
however  there can be no assurance that these costs will not be greater than anticipated  or that corrective actions undertaken will be completed before any year problems occur 
the year issue could lower demand for the company s products while increasing the company s costs 
these combining factors  while not quantified  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
state of readiness to manage its year program  the company has divided its efforts into three program areas information technology computer hardware  software  and electronic data interchange edi interfaces  physical plant manufacturing equipment and facilities and extended enterprise suppliers and customers

facilities assessment is in process and on schedule to be completed by july extended enterprise as a result of discussions with its computer software program suppliers  the company has been assured that all of its current software will be modified or replaced to be year compliant 
in addition  the company has initiated a formal year compliance document where the company s software suppliers will certify their plans and action steps for modification or replacement of existing company software to ensure timely year compliance 
the company has initiated formal communications with its key customers and suppliers to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to the failure of those third parties to address their own year issues 
at this time  the company cannot determine the impact the year will have on its key customers or suppliers 
if the company s customers or suppliers do not convert their systems to become year compliant  the company may be materially adversely affected 
costs to address year issues currently  the company expects that the costs associated with becoming year compliant will not exceed 
million  of which approximately 
million has been expended to date 
risks of year issues and contingency plans the company continues to assess the year issues relating to its physical plant  suppliers and customers 
the company is developing  and will continue to develop  contingency plans for dealing with any adverse effect that becomes likely in the event the company s remediation plans are not successful or third parties fail to remediate their own year issues 
the company s contingency planning process is intended to mitigate worst case business disruptions
