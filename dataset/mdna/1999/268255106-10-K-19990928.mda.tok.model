accounts payable decreased primarily due to the uk operation s novation of a contract to lockheed martin asic lockheed  as well as improved accounts payable aging in the domestic operation 
see below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts payable increased in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of increased material purchases as the company progressed on its new contracts 
during fiscal year  advances on long term contracts decreased primarily due to the uk operation s novation of a contract to lockheed and the wind down of its operations see below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
advances on long term contracts increased in fiscal year primarily as a result of work performed on contracts in the uk operation 
on december   the uk operation entered into a novation agreement with lockheed 
under the agreement  the uk operation assigned all rights and obligations under a certain contract to lockheed 
the terms of the novation permit the uk operation to extend payments  already owing to lockheed  to monthly installments through december at june   the total outstanding due to lockheed was approximately million 
the current portion of this agreement was million and is included in accrued expenses and other 
the balance is included in other long term liabilities 
on june  the company entered into a revolving credit facility credit facility with a bank totaling million and expiring on june  proceeds from the credit facility were used to pay the outstanding balance under the company s loan facility with its previous primary lender 
the outstanding balance under the credit facility at june  was approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
available borrowings which are based on a formula of receivables and property as defined in the credit facility  were million at june  the increase in capital in excess of par at june  and june  was primarily the result of the purchase of stock under employee stock purchase plans and the issuance of shares under the director s equity plan 
the company anticipates spending approximately million for new machinery and equipment and to continue to refurbish the orlando facility during fiscal year the company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business

during fiscal year  the company implemented various cost reduction initiatives and changes in management including the relocation of the corporate headquarters and instructional systems development group from wayne  pennsylvania to the company s principal systems design and production center in orlando  florida

see note to the consolidated financial statements management believes that these initiatives  as well as  improved gross margin levels resulting from the completion of many large cost plus type contracts which have historically had lower gross margins than the fixed price type and improved performance on existing programs  contributed to the significantly reduced loss in fiscal year and position the company for future profitability 
management s plans to improve future profitability include a continuation of both direct and indirect cost reduction initiatives and improvement of operating performance  and an aggressive focus on obtaining follow on awards to existing business as well as  the implementation of strategies to procure new business and penetrate new markets 
other than as stated above  the company has no other material commitments for capital expenditures 
management believes that with the funds available under its new credit facility and its projected cash flow  the company will have sufficient resources to meet planned operating commitments for the foreseeable future 
results of operations compared with net sales decreased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease is primarily the result of reduced activity in the uk operation related to its wind down 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting the decrease was progress on existing domestic operation programs including javelin multi year  cctt lrip  f e f  engagement skills trainers est  as well as several additions to other ongoing contracts 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year domestic training contract gross margin levels improved as a result of the completion of many large cost plus type contracts which have historically had lower gross margins than the fixed price type as well as improved performance on existing programs 
in addition  the company s cost reduction initiatives during fiscal year reduced overhead costs  thus improving gross margins 
the gross margin in the uk operation also improved over the prior fiscal year as a result of the accrual for loss contracts recorded at june  selling  general and administrative expense decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease is primarily the result of cost containment initiatives  closure of the corporate headquarters in wayne  pennsylvania and the completion of the wind down of the uk operation 
partially offsetting these decreases were costs related to increased utilization of consulting services related to marketing  refinancing of debt  outplacement and executive search services and increased legal fees 
independent research and development ir d expense decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was primarily a result of more focused initiatives  cost containment efforts and continuation of ir d costs now included as part of the est contract and recorded in cost of sales since the award of the contract in the second quarter of fiscal year as a result of recurring losses in the uk operation  the board of directors announced  during the first quarter of fiscal year  the approval of a plan to wind down and discontinue the uk operation 
the wind down was completed in may in addition  on september   the company relocated its corporate headquarters staff and instructional systems development group from wayne  pennsylvania to the company s principal systems design and production center in orlando  florida 
as a result of the wind down of the uk operation and the relocation of the corporate headquarters  the company recorded charges of approximately million during fiscal year these charges primarily relate to employee termination benefits and lease termination costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements interest expense decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to payments made on the previous credit facility of million 
net loss decreased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to the company s cost cutting initiatives  wind down of the uk operation and relocation of the corporate headquarters 
the million net loss is comprised of a million loss in the uk operation and an  loss in the domestic operation 
the net loss includes million of non recurring expenses million in the uk operation and million in the domestic operation associated with the wind down of the uk operation and the relocation of the corporate headquarters as discussed above 
compared with continuing operations net sales decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in net sales was primarily the result of several domestic training division contracts with reduced activity as they were complete or near completion 
this decrease in net sales was partially offset by sales generated from the award of several new contracts during the third quarter of fiscal year including javelin multi year  cctt lrip  a saudi vigs contract  as well as several additions to other ongoing contracts 
net sales in the uk operation also decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in net sales in the uk operation was a result of reduced activity on its two major contracts as they were expected to be completed during the first half of fiscal year the uk operation was awarded a contract for cabin crew training equipment from airtours international airways ltd 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  however  there was no other substantial new business awarded during the year 
gross margin decreased as a percentage of net sales from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this decrease was due to significant gross margin adjustments on contracts in the uk operation 
the lack of new business awards over the year  as well as no anticipated future awards have resulted in a business base  which is not sufficient to absorb fixed costs 
as a result  the uk operation recorded margin adjustments resulting from the need to recognize additional costs on certain contracts and contract loss accruals of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales in the domestic training division remained relatively consistent with fiscal year contract gross margin levels improved as a result of the completion or near completion of many large cost plus type contracts which have historically had lower gross margins than the fixed price type 
in addition  the company s cost reduction initiatives during fiscal year reduced overhead costs  thus improving gross margins 
the improvement in contract gross margins were offset by a change in the method of accounting for precontract costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the company changed its method of accounting for precontract costs from deferring costs incurred for specific anticipated contracts and including those costs in contract sales and costs when the contract award is assured  to expensing the costs as incurred in accordance with statement of position reporting on the cost of start up activities 
the statement requires that precontract costs that are start up costs be expensed as incurred 
as a result of implementing sop  the company wrote off approximately  pre tax of start up costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
although management initiated several cost cutting initiatives in fiscal year  the benefit of these reductions was not proportionate to the decrease in sales volume  thereby resulting in an overall net loss for the year 
since fiscal year  management has effected a reduction in work force consistent with the reduction in contract volume 
however  costs associated with the reduction in work force  including severance benefits and out placement services  were incurred thereby minimizing the impact of the reduction in work force on gross margin 
all of these costs were paid during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expense increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was a result of fees paid to international marketing representatives  consulting fees and an increase in bid and proposal and marketing activities 
in addition  depreciation expense increased as a result of the implementation of the new computer system on june ir d expense increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of efforts in the domestic training division to develop or enhance technologies and processes in order to remain competitive in the industry 
other operating expenses increased as a result of an evaluation of expected future undiscounted cash flows associated with the long lived assets in the uk operation 
as a result of this evaluation  an impairment charge of million was recorded for plant and equipment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as interest due the company based on the irs look back method of accounting for completed contracts was substantially lower than the amount received in the previous fiscal year 
interest expense decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a result of final payments totaling  on the company s term loan during the first quarter of fiscal year as well as payments totaling  on the revolving credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal year discontinued operations on november   the company completed the sale of the fixed assets  inventory and trade receivables of the company s vending operation 
proceeds from the sale of the vending operation were used to reduce the company s debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating results have been segregated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
net losses for fiscal year  were included as a component of discontinued operations in the company s june  consolidated statements 
discontinued operations at june  included management s best estimates of amounts expected to be realized on the sale of the vending operation  the costs directly associated with the disposal of the operation  as well as the operating losses expected to be incurred during the phase out period 
during fiscal year  the company recorded an additional provision for the estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations of  after tax 
the change in the estimated loss resulted primarily from additional costs associated with the consummation of the sale of the fixed assets  inventory and trade receivables of the vending operation 
compared with continuing operations net sales decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in net sales is primarily the result of several domestic training division contracts with reduced activity as they are complete or expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal year sales volume in the uk operation increased modestly over the preceding year due to continued efforts on its two largest contracts 
gross margin decreased as a percentage of sales from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this decrease was due to gross margin adjustments on certain contracts in the uk operation  a reduction in sales volume in the domestic training division as well as the continued change in contract mix in the domestic training division 
gross margin in the uk operation decreased as a result of contract adjustments recorded during fiscal year gross margin adjustments were taken on its two large contracts due to protracted or delayed hardware software testing  re work required on trainers and late delivery penalties imposed due to contract delays 
in addition  gross margin adjustments were taken due to a decrease in expected future sales volume which  may result in higher overhead rates than previously anticipated 
domestic training also experienced a decrease in gross margin compared to the prior fiscal year 
while the company has experienced an increase in volume on its large domestic cost plus type contracts  these contracts generally yield lower gross margins than the fixed price type 
in addition  actual sales volume in fiscal was lower than expected due to the completion or near completion of numerous contracts  which were not replaced by new business 
while cost reduction initiatives are underway  overhead and s  g a levels have not decreased proportionate to the decrease in sales volume 
since fiscal year management has effected a reduction in work force consistent with the reduction in contract volume 
however  costs associated with the reduction in work force including subcontracted labor  including severance benefits and out placement services  were incurred  thereby minimizing the impact of the reduction in work force on gross margin 
all of these costs were paid during fiscal year ir d expense increased in fiscal year as a result of efforts in the domestic training division to develop and or enhance technologies and processes in order to remain competitive in the industry 
interest income increased in fiscal year as a result of interest due the company based on the irs look back method of accounting for long term contracts 
interest expense increased marginally in fiscal year due to increased borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement during the first three quarters of fiscal year discontinued operations operating results of the discontinued operation have been segregated in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
net losses of the discontinued operation during were million loss per share  including the loss on disposal as well as provisions for operating losses during the phase out period of million 
this compares to million loss per share in the vending operation experienced a reduction in gross margin as a result of low sales volume  which was not sufficient to cover overhead costs for the year 
certain factors that may affect future operating results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
a number of uncertainties exist that could affect the company s future operating results including  without limitation  general economic conditions  changes in government spending  cancellation of weapons programs  delays in contract awards  delays in the acceptance process of contract deliverables  the company s continued ability to develop and introduce products  the introduction of new products by competitors  pricing practices of competitors  the cost and availability of parts and the company s ability to control costs 
to date  a substantial portion of the company s revenues have been attributable to long term contracts with various government agencies 
as a result  any factor adversely affecting procurement of long term government contracts could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indication of future performance 
the company s future operating results may vary significantly 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and other factors  including those discussed above 
year issue the year problem relates to computer systems that have time and date sensitive programs that were designed to read years beginning with  but may not properly recognize the year if a computer system or software application used by the company or a third party dealing with the company fails because of the inability of the system or application to properly read the year the results could conceivably have a material adverse effect on the company if not adequately remedied by the company  its suppliers and customers on a timely basis 
the company has formally addressed the year issue since november when a year compliance program was initiated 
a complete evaluation was made on all internal systems  including voice mail  automated badge entry  e mail  payroll  accounting  facilities and products 
in addition  the company is working with its prime contractors to identify year problems that may affect the integration of the company s product with those of the prime contractor 
the company will work with its prime contractors to remediate any problems as they are identified 
for its information technology  the company currently utilizes a network of unix and windows nt platforms  which provide company wide access to all of the company s business application programs 
employees access the network application software through individual pc s approximately  all of which are compliant 
all company network operating systems and substantially all operating systems on individual workstations have been updated to comply with year requirements 
periodically  new application programs and updated versions of existing programs are added to the system 
the company has a policy to accept only year compliant software and has instituted an ongoing program to confirm that all new software programs are compliant with year requirements 
the company is currently performing a final re verification test of all systems as part of that ongoing program 
further  the company has recently replaced all central core components of its network and all satellite switching cabinets with year compliant lucent technologies cajun series switch routers 
although there can be no assurance that the company will identify and correct every year problem found in its computer applications  the company believes that it has in place a comprehensive program to identify and correct any such problems 
the company has reviewed its building and utility systems heat  light  phones  etc 
for the impact of year all of the internal systems in this area are year ready 
while the company has no reason to believe that its utility suppliers will not meet their required year compliance targets  there can be no assurance that these suppliers will in fact meet the company s requirements 
the failure of any such supplier to fully remediate its systems for year compliance could cause a partial shutdown of the company s plant  which could impact the company s ability to meet its obligations to supply products to its customers 
the company is satisfied that its customer base is aware of the year issue and is proactively working to ensure that there are no problems associated with the year the company is aware of this because all major customers have asked the company for its year status 
in the process  they have revealed their year plans and stated that they are actively engaged in solving any problems 
the company also previously commenced a program to determine the year compliance efforts of its equipment and material suppliers 
the company has sent requests to all of its significant suppliers regarding their year compliance  requesting that they warrant their ability to provide services and supplies in the year more than half of the suppliers have warranted their ability to provide supplies in the year  and the remainder have presented a plan to have their company compliant by the end of calendar year this program will be ongoing and the company s efforts with respect to specific problems identified will depend in part upon its assessment of the risk that any such problems may cause the shutdown of a customer s plant or its operations 
unfortunately  the company cannot fully control the conduct of its suppliers  and there can be no guarantee that year problems originating with a supplier will not occur 
the company has developed contingency plans in the event of a year failure caused by a supplier or third party 
in some cases  especially with respect to its utility vendors  alternative suppliers may not be available 
the company has made arrangements to have key personnel continuously on site during the transition from to to react immediately to any unforeseen failure 
the company believes the cost of year compliance for its information and productions systems has not and will not be material to its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
if the company does not become year compliant in a timely manner  the year issue could have a material impact on the business  financial condition and results of operations 
delays in year compliance could also adversely affect the company s reputation and competitive position and impair its ability to process customer transactions and orders and payments of supplier merchandise 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios would include corruption of data contained in the company s internal information systems  hardware failure and the failure of infrastructure services provided by third parties eg electricity  phone service  eg the company has completed its contingency plan for high  medium  and low risk areas 
the plans include  among other things  manual work arounds for software and hardware failures  as well as substitutions of systems  if necessary 
the foregoing shall be considered a year readiness disclosure to the maximum extent allowed under the year information and readiness disclosure act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has a variable rate revolving credit facility and  as such  has exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
under current market conditions  the impact of an increase or decrease in the prevailing interest rates would not materially effect the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations
