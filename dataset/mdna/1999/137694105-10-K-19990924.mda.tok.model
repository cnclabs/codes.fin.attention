this equipment will be sold or refinanced when these payments are due 
management believes that it is unlikely that the cost and availability of financing will be adversely affected by this working capital deficit in the near future 
the company was caught in a cycle of large demand for new trucks and long lead times for new truck orders 
due to the manufacturer s lead time for new trucks  the company was unable to secure any replacement trucks on schedule and was forced to make expensive non warranty repairs to its older equipment 
during fiscal  the company has taken delivery of new trucks and has sold trucks  reducing its fleet to at june  the company has entered into an agreement to purchase new trucks for its fleet with deliveries beginning in july of and continuing through june of the company will sell approximately of its older trucks  which will return the company s fleet to its former size of trucks 
the cost of the new trucks  net of trade ins  will be approximately  the new truck specifications include features that afford the driver a higher level of comfort and appeal than the older models being traded in 
management believes that these new trucks  when placed in service  will reduce maintenance costs and time lost for repairs 
in order to improve its operating results  the company is implementing a new program in which owner operators may qualify to lease purchase a truck and be paid a percentage of the company s revenue to operate it under a contract with the company to haul freight for its customers 
management believes that an owner operator fleet will improve results in the company s driver retention efforts 
additionally  certain costs associated with truck ownership will pass from the company to the owner operator 
inflation inflation continues to have a minimal impact on operations 
seasonality in the trucking industry generally  results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers reduce shipments during the winter 
the company s operating efficiency historically decreases during the winter months due to increased maintenance costs  reduced fuel efficiency  detours and delays for weather 
year issues the company has completed an assessment of its internal systems with regard to year compliance and has determined that its computer hardware and critical software applications are compliant 
the company will convert its edi format to asc x  version which is year compliant 
the company s communication systems which include telephones  on board computers for trucks  voice mail  and electronic mail e mail are certified compliant 
although the company believed that its systems would be year compliant  in april of  the company determined that it would purchase new computer software for its business 
this decision was made primarily due to the increased cost and inefficiency of maintaining the company s own software 
the new software requires that the company also purchase new computer hardware 
this new computer system will cost approximately  however  the company has entered into a lease agreement to fund this purchase 
the new system will be certified year compliant by the manufacturer of the computer and the developer of the software 
management believes that the new system will enable the company to better manage its business and to utilize new technologies as they are developed 
the company expects to convert its systems during the fourth quarter of calendar year the company will continue to operate its old system for archival purposes 
in the event the new software does not perform as expected  the old system will be available for backup 
the company has assurances from its utilities providers of an implementation plan in place 
backup power generators are certified compliant 
however  the company s business requires that it operate in all regions of the united states  and the company may rely indirectly on utility providers over which it has no control 
infrastructure failures could significantly reduce the company s ability to serve its customers 
the company s trucks are certified compliant for the year by the manufacturer 
the company has conducted a survey of other internal electronic devices which may have embedded technology likely to be affected by the year and believes that no critical devices will fail 
the company has requested written assurance from its customers and vendors of their year compliance to determine the extent of any effect on the company s operations 
the company has not received written assurances from its significant customers and vendors that their systems will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the company 
it is not possible at this time to quantify the amount of business that might be lost or other costs that could be incurred by the company as a result of the company s customers and vendors failure to remediate their year issues 
the company believes that the most likely worst case scenario which it may face would be the inability of one or more of its major customers to communicate electronically through edi electronic data interchange 
in that event  the company believes that it would be able to continue its business as it did prior to edi until those customers systems return to normal 
the company estimates that its cost of becoming year compliant will be less than  with the majority of the expense accounted for in the cost of operations through june  the company s contingency plans relative to the year have not been finalized 
these plans are evolving as the testing of systems progresses 
during the testing and conversion phase  management will develop and modify a worst case scenario contingency plan based on testing and conversion results 
the company subscribes to a service called year stocks via the internet at www 
yearstocks 
com as one of the ways to stay abreast of the year issues
