at november   the prime rate was 
although this loan matures on december   the entire loan was reclassified as a current liability at november  because the company was in violation of two loan covenants at such date  one of which has since been cured 
although coast offered to provide a written waiver of such violations  the company declined to accept such waiver as it deemed the conditions of the waiver to be unreasonably expensive

based on a recent assessment  the company determined that it will be required to modify or replace portions of its software and hardware so that its systems will function properly with respect to the dates in the year and thereafter

however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the company s systems rely will be timely converted and would not have a material adverse effect in the company s systems 
the telecommunications division has identified that the third party which processes essex s customer invoices is not compliant with the year issues 
the company has identified another third party which is compliant  and if needed  the company will utilize the new third party source for customer invoicing by june should its current billing provider fail to convert its systems six months before the year the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test the software and hardware for year compliance

all costs associated with the year project are being funded through operating cash flow 
costs and timetables for year projects associated with corporate mergers and acquisitions are not included in the above estimates  and will be funded on a case by case basis as they occur 
the costs of the project and the date which the company has established to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates  which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events  including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans  and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes  unanticipated mergers and acquisitions  and similar uncertainties
