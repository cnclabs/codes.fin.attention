general family golf is the leading consolidator and operator of golf centers in north america 
the company s golf centers provide a wide variety of practice and play opportunities  including facilities for driving  chipping  putting  pitching and sand play 
the company s golf centers typically offer full line pro shops  golf lessons instructed by pga certified golf professionals and other amenities such as miniature golf and snack bars to encourage family participation 
the company has grown from one golf facility in to as of december   including facilities under construction 
in addition  in order to generate additional sources of revenue  attract a more diverse customer base and offset the seasonality of its core golf business  the company has selectively acquired  constructed and begun operating complementary sports and family entertainment facilities  including ice rinks and family sports supercenters 
family sports supercenters have two or more sports related attractions including at least one of the company s core sports related attractions golf centers and ice rinks  and may include other sports related attractions such as bowling centers  soccer facilities and batting cages  as well as a variety of family entertainment activities 
as of december   the company operated eight stand alone ice rink facilities  managed additional ice rink facilities and operated three family sports supercenters 
the company has opened or acquired facilities at varying times over the past several years 
as a result of changes in the number of facilities open from period to period  the seasonality of operations  the timing of acquisitions  the completion of the company s initial public offering of common stock in november the initial public offering  the public offering of common stock in december the public offering  the public offering of common stock in july the offering  the private placement of million aggregate principal amount of the notes in the fourth quarter of the note offering  the public offering of common stock in july the offering and the expansion of the company s business to include ice rinks and family sports supercenters  results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results of operations in the future 
most of the company s revenue from its golf centers are derived from selling tokens and debit cards for use in automated range ball dispensing machines  pro shop merchandise sales  charging for rounds of miniature golf  golf lessons and management fees 
the company also derives revenue from its golf centers from food and beverage sales  video games and batting cages 
the company derives revenue from its golf courses from golf club membership fees  fees for rounds of golf and golf lessons  pro shop merchandise sales and from food and beverage sales at the clubhouses 
the company derives revenue from its ice rinks by renting the rinks to hockey leagues and teams and figure skaters  charging admission to its skating facilities for public skating  providing lessons through usfsa certified instructors  skate equipment rentals and pro shop merchandise sales  as well as from food and beverage sales and video games 
the company derives revenue from its family sports supercenters from substantially the same sources as described above 
as a result of their greater size and number of attractions  the company s family sports supercenters are expected to generate significantly more revenue than individual golf centers  and are expected to generate a majority of their revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year 
on june   the company issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for all outstanding common stock  options and warrants of eagle quest 
this exchange  which qualified as a tax free reorganization for federal income tax purposes  has been accounted for as a pooling of interests combination and  accordingly  the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combination have been restated to include the combined results of operations  financial position and cash flows of eagle quest which was incorporated in february as though it had been a part of the company since inception 
under the pooling of interests method  the assets and liabilities of eagle quest are carried at their historical amounts and the historical operating results of eagle quest are combined with those of family golf for all periods presented 
all information presented below reflects such combination

the cash requirements of funding the company s expansion have historically exceeded cash flow from operations 
accordingly  the company has satisfied its capital needs primarily through equity and debt financings  as well as cash flow from operations 
the company continually explores raising additional capital through such means 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available in the future on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
the company s outstanding indebtedness as of december   including the notes and other indebtedness of million  bears interest at fixed and variable rates currently ranging from to per annum 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed the million note offering

on december   family golf and a syndicate of banks led by the chase manhattan bank chase entered into a two year million secured revolving credit facility as amended  the credit facility which converts to a four year term loan in december after conversion to the term loan  the loan is to be repaid in substantially equal quarterly installments 
the company s obligations under the credit facility are secured by the pledge of the stock of most of the company s subsidiaries and such subsidiaries have also guaranteed such obligations 
at the time of each loan under the credit facility  the company may choose between an interest rate based on the greater of i chase s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum the base rate plus per annum or ii the london interbank offered rate libor  plus between and per annum depending on the company s ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda as such terms are defined in the credit facility 
during the term loan  the interest rate will be increased by per annum in the case of base rate loans and per annum in the case of libor loans 
the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including  among others  covenants limiting liens  indebtedness  acquisitions  asset sales  construction of new facilities  capital expenditures and investments and covenants requiring continued compliance with certain financial tests  including  among others  a net worth test and several financial ratios 
borrowings under the credit facility will be limited by the financial tests thereunder and there can be no assurance that all or a portion of the million will be available when required by the company 
the company may pay dividends as long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing 
included among the events of default are any change of control as defined in the credit facility of the company 
a portion of the proceeds of the credit facility were used to repay million principal amount of indebtedness to chase  which was outstanding as of september  as of december   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
in connection with the lci acquisition  family golf incurred term debt the term debt to refinance lci s existing indebtedness 
the principal amount of the term debt million as of december  is being paid in monthly installments through august the company has the same interest rate choices with respect to the term debt as it does with respect to the term loan under the credit facility and the term debt is subject to the same operational financial requirements 
the indebtedness is secured by a mortgage lien upon the three parcels of real property leased by lci 
in march  family golf entered into a loan agreement with chinatrust bank providing for a million term loan secured by a mortgage on five of the company s existing properties 
the loan matures in april and bears interest at the prime rate less during the drawdown period and at the prime rate during the paydown period 
as of december   the company had drawn down the full million 
on july   the company entered into a loan agreement with orix usa corporation orix providing for a million term loan  secured by a mortgage on five of the company s existing properties 
the loan matures in july and bears interest at either i the prime rate or ii libor plus 
as a condition to obtaining this loan  orix required that the company enter into an interest rate protection agreement 
accordingly  the company entered into a swap transaction agreement with chase  on july   which  in effect  fixes the libor rate under the term loan agreement at 
in the event libor exceeds such fixed rate  chase is required to pay such excess to the company  and in the event that libor is less than such fixed rate  the company is required to pay chase such difference 
as of december   million was outstanding under the orix loan 
on december   the company acquired skatenation for million consisting of million of cash and million of indebtedness  subject to certain adjustments 
such indebtedness is described below 
skatenation  skatenation of piney orchard piney orchard  skatenation of prince william prince william  skatenation of richmond south richmond south and skatenation of richmond west richmond west are borrowers and guarantors under a master loan agreement with nationsbank na nationsbank  dated october  the nationsbank loan agreement 
this agreement encompasses four term loans  each secured by the guarantee of  and cross defaulted to  the loan to each of skatenation  piney orchard  prince william  richmond south and richmond west 
the outstanding indebtedness under the nationsbank loan agreement is evidenced by four promissory notes each of which i bears interest at libor plus the applicable margin as defined in the nationsbank loan agreement and ii is payable  plus accrued interest  in monthly installments commencing in november and ending in march as of december   the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest owed under the promissory notes was as follows i approximately million by piney orchard  ii approximately million by prince william  iii approximately million by richmond south  and iv approximately million by richmond west 
pursuant to the terms of the nationsbank loan agreement  nationsbank has a first priority security interest and deed and trust lien on all the assets of piney orchard  prince william  richmond south and richmond west 
as a result of the skatenation acquisition  nationsbank was entitled to accelerate the maturity of the loans 
nationsbank has given the company a temporary waiver  expiring june   and the parties are currently negotiating an amendment to the nationsbank loan agreement to restructure the covenants and keep the loans in place until their originally scheduled maturity 
international skating center of connecticut  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of skatenation iscc  is obligated under a mortgage loan and security agreement  dated august  the fleet loan agreement by and between fleet national bank and iscc 
as of december   the aggregate principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the original million mortgage note was approximately million  which is payable in monthly installments ending in august and bears interest at 
pursuant to the terms of the fleet loan agreement  fleet national bank has a first priority security interest and lien on the assets of iscc  has obtained a leasehold mortgage on iscc s leasehold interests  and has received a pledge of iscc s depository account 
in connection with the purchase of iscc  iscc executed a purchase money note in favor of world skate  llc in the amount of  secured by an open end leasehold mortgage deed  assignment of subleases and security agreement the pm loan 
as of december   the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the pm loan was approximately  the company anticipates making substantial additional expenditures in connection with the acquisition and operation of new facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities 
facility opening expenditures primarily relate to projected facility construction and opening costs  associated marketing activities and the addition of personnel 
in many cases  the company acquires  rather than leases  the land on which its facilities are located  which entails additional expenditures 
based on the company s experience with its existing golf centers  the company believes that the cost of opening or acquiring a golf center generally ranges from approximately million to million exclusive of land costs 
the company also intends to acquire or construct additional ice rink facilities and family sports supercenters which  on a per facility basis  are expected to cost more than the company s golf centers 
the company believes that the cost of opening or acquiring ice rink facilities will range from approximately million to million exclusive of land costs and the cost of opening or acquiring family sports supercenters will range from to million exclusive of land costs 
however  there can be no assurance that facility opening or acquisition costs will not exceed the amounts estimated above 
facility opening and acquisition costs vary substantially depending on the location and status of the acquired property ie whether significant improvements are necessary and whether the company acquires or leases the related land 
land acquisition costs vary substantially depending on a number of factors  principally location 
to the extent that the company acquires any golf courses  the company may be required to make capital improvements to these courses  depending upon the location and status of the acquired property 
the cost of facility acquisition depends  to a large extent  upon the price of the land and may substantially exceed the anticipated cost of facility acquisitions 
effect of recently acquired facilities after giving effect on a pro forma basis to certain acquisitions consummated after january  as if they had occurred on january   the company would have had a net loss of approximately million as compared to a net loss of million on a historical basis for the year ended december  and a net loss of million as compared to net income of million for the twelve months ended december  although newly acquired facilities have adversely affected income on a pro forma basis in the past and may adversely affect income on a pro forma basis in the future  the company believes that it will be able to enhance the performance of such facilities by adding amenities and other improvements and centralizing key functions as described in business business strategy 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to improve the performance of newly acquired facilities  and  in this connection  the recently acquired eagle quest and golden bear facilities 
seasonality historically  the second and third quarters of the calendar year have accounted for a greater portion of the company s operating income than have the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this is primarily due to an outdoor playing season limited by inclement weather 
although most of the company s facilities are designed to be all weather  portions of the facilities  such as miniature golf courses which are outdoors  tend to be vulnerable to weather conditions 
one of the company s golf centers and one golf course are closed during a portion of the winter 
also  golfers are less inclined to practice when weather conditions limit their ability to play golf on outdoor courses 
since august  the company has acquired golf centers in various locations where inclement weather may not limit the outdoor playing season as much as such weather limits the outdoor playing season at the company s golf facilities in less temperate climates 
in addition  the ice rink facilities and the family sports supercenters are expected to generate a substantial portion of their revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year and  accordingly  may partially offset such seasonality 
the timing of new facility acquisitions and openings may cause the company s results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results

the sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier application allowable in fiscal years for which annual statements have not been issued 
the effects of the initial application of this sop will be reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
the company adopted the sop in the third quarter of effective as of january  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles resulted in a charge of million  net of related tax benefit 
inflation there was no significant impact on the company s operations as a result of inflation during  or year issues in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company notes that certain statements contained in the following discussion concerning the change over to the year are forward looking in nature and are subject to many risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements include such matters as the company s projected state of readiness  the company s projected cost of remediation  the expected date of completion of each program or phase and the expected contingency plans associated with any worst case scenarios 
such statements also constitute year readiness disclosure within the meaning of the year information and readiness disclosure act 
the year issue is the result of computer programs using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
such software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in system failures or miscalculations leading to disruptions in the company s activities and operations 
the company has formed a project team  comprised of the company s management information services staff  to identify and correct year compliance issues for the company s information technology it systems as well as the non it systems such as fire and burglar alarms  irrigation systems and time clocks 
the project team has been charged with the responsibility of investigating and remediating any and all problems associated with the millennium bug 
all systems that are not compliant will be either modified or replaced as is necessary  although since a majority of the company s systems are industry standard software systems which are year compliant  the company does not expect that significant modification or replacement will be necessary 
although there can be no assurance  the total projected cost associated with the company s year program is not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the total cost for the project excluding internal payroll costs is currently expected to approximate  to  which is being funded with the company s working capital 
as of december   the company had incurred approximately  relating to its year compliance project 
the project team has defined a four phase approach to determining the year readiness of the company s systems  software and equipment 
phase i  inventory assessment  involves the inventory of all systems  software and equipment and the identification of any year issues 
this phase is complete 
phase ii  remediation  involves repairing  upgrading and or replacing any non compliant equipment and systems 
the company has already begun replacing its older ibm systems with year compliant windows registered trademark based systems as part of the company s plans to upgrade its point of sales merchandise control systems 
the company expects to adjust rather than replace its non it systems to perform properly in the year and thereafter 
phase iii  testing  involves testing the company s systems  software  and equipment for year readiness  or in certain cases  relying on test results provided to the company from suppliers 
the project team has commenced testing of the company s most critical software programs to ensure year compliance and has begun contacting all major suppliers to review year compliance issues of their products 
by may   the company intends to engage an independent consultant to verify and validate the state of readiness of the company s systems 
phase iv  implementation and completion  involves placing compliant systems  software and equipment into production or service and implementing all necessary contingency plans 
in the event that any program or system fails system readiness testing  the company will rely on its contingency plans to alleviate the year issues 
these contingency plans will include  but will not be limited to  development of backup and recovery procedures  remediation of existing systems in parallel with the installation of new systems  replacement with temporary manual processes and identification of alternative suppliers 
as of december   the company s overall progress by phase for all it and non it systems was as follows target phase percent complete completion date phase i inventory assessment complete phase ii remediation may  phase iii testing may  phase iv implementation and completion june  the completion dates set forth above are based on the company s current expectations 
however  due to the uncertainties inherent in year remediation  no assurance can be given as to whether such projects will be completed on such dates 
the failure to correct a material year problem could result in an interruption or failure of certain important business operations 
the failure of the company s point of sales systems and billing systems could result in the company s inability to timely post and record sales revenue and expenses 
in addition  the aging of the company s accounts payable would be inaccurate 
in this unlikely event  the company would manually record sales and expenses until a year compliant system is applied 
the financial impact of any or all of the above worst case scenarios has not been and cannot be estimated by the company due to the numerous uncertainties and variables associated with such scenarios 
management believes  however  that its year program will significantly reduce the company s risks associated with the change over to the year at the present time the company has not deferred any it projects nor does it anticipate that such a deferral will be necessary as a result of its year efforts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has entered into three interest rate protection agreements covering approximately million in outstanding indebtedness 
such agreements permit the company to achieve fixed rates of interest in lieu of variable rates of interest
