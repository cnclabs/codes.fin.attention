the company s results of operations are dependent  in part  on its ability to predict and maintain effective control over health care costs through  among other things  appropriate benefit design  utilization review and case management programs and its risk sharing agreements with providers while providing members with coverage for the health care benefits provided under their contracts 
factors such as new technologies and health care practices  hospital costs  changes in demographics and trends  selection biases  increases in unit costs paid to providers  major epidemics  catastrophes  inability to establish acceptable compensation agreements with providers  higher utilization of medical services  including higher out of network utilization under point of service plans  operational and regulatory issues and numerous other factors may affect the company s ability to control such costs

results of operations will be adversely affected if such steps cannot be successfully implemented or if there are delays in such implementation 
in addition  the company may decide to increase certain administrative costs to attempt to improve service levels

liquidity and capital resources cash used by operations during aggregated million compared with million in the improvement is primarily attributable to the receipt in of federal and state tax refunds totaling million

the company also sold and leased back computer equipment with a value of million 
the company currently anticipates that capital expenditures and payments under capital leases for will be approximately million  a significant portion of which will be devoted to management information systems 
except for anticipated capital expenditures and requirements to provide the required levels of capital to its operating subsidiaries  including any requirement arising from nonadmissibility of provider advances as discussed below or other assets or from operating losses  the company currently has no definitive commitments for use of material cash 
cash and investments aggregating million at december  have been segregated as restricted investments to comply with federal and state regulatory requirements 
the company expects to set aside additional funds not expected to exceed million as collateral for certain advances made by the company s new jersey subsidiary see below 
in addition  the company s subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on their abilities to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to the parent company  which limit the ability of the company to use cash generated by subsidiary operations to pay the obligations of the parent  including debt service and other financing costs 
in september  the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted new minimum capitalization requirements  known as risk based capital rules  for health care coverage provided by hmos and other risk bearing health care entities 
depending on the nature and extent of the new minimum capitalization requirements ultimately adopted by each state  there could be an increase in the capital required for certain of the company s regulated subsidiaries 
connecticut has introduced legislation allowing the connecticut department of insurance ctdoi to promulgate regulations based on the naic model 
the company expects the ctdoi regulations to be applicable to its annual financial statements 
neither new york nor new jersey have introduced similar legislation 
however  the new jersey department of banking and insurance njdbi has published draft solvency regulations that it estimates will result in an additional million worth of deposit by all new jersey health care plans 
the new york superintendent of insurance has announced an intention to strengthen current solvency regulations to allow the nysid to take over failing health plans without a court order 
the company intends to fund any increase from available parent company cash reserves  however  there can be no assurance that such cash reserves will be sufficient to fund these minimum capitalization requirements 
the new requirements are expected to be effective on or before december  upon enactment by each state 
premiums receivable at december  decreased to million from million at december  primarily due to improved collections and continued clean up efforts for nonpaying groups and reconcilliations and increased reserves for doubtful accounts 
as a result of the previously discussed delays in claims payments  the company experienced a significant increase in medical claims payable during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  but the increase in medical costs payable was mitigated by progress in paying backlogged claims and by making advance payments to providers and reductions in ibnr relating to the company s exit from certain businesses during the first quarter of and thereafter 
outstanding advances  net of a million valuation reserve  aggregated approximately million at december  and have been netted against medical costs payable in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company believes that it will be able to recover outstanding advance payments  either through repayment by the provider or application against future claims  but any failure to recover funds advanced in excess of the reserve would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will continue to recognize such advances as admissible assets and the new jersey department of banking and insurance is requiring the company to provide collateral for repayment of the advances by setting aside in trust at the parent company funds equal to the admitted portion of the advances on the new jersey subsidiary s statutory financial statement currently not expected to exceed million 
if the company fails to provide such collateral or if all or a portion of the advances were deemed nonadmitted  the capital of the company s operating subsidiaries would be impaired and additional capital contributions would be required for the subsidiaries to meet statutory requirements 
the company s medical costs payable was million as of december   before netting advance claim payments of million including million for ibnr compared with million as of december   before netting advance claim payments of million including million for ibnr 
the company estimates the amount of its ibnr reserves using standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical data  including the average intervals between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid and between the date services are rendered and the date claims are received by the company  expected medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns and changes in membership 
the liability is also affected by shared risk arrangements  including arrangements relating to the company s medicare business in certain counties and private practice partnerships partnerships 
in determining the liability for medical costs payable  the company accounts for the financial impact of the transfer of risk for certain medicare members and the experience of risk sharing partnership providers who may be entitled to credits from oxford for favorable experience or subject to deductions for accrued deficits 
in the case of the medicare risk arrangements  the company no longer records a reserve for claims liability since the payment obligation has been transferred to third parties 
in the case of partnership providers subject to deficits  the company has established reserves to account for delays or other impediments to recovery of those deficits 
the company has reviewed its partnership program and has terminated most of its partnership arrangements as a result of difficulties and expense associated with administering the program as well as other considerations

year readiness the company has completed its assessment of its computer systems and facilities that could be affected by the year date conversion and is continuing to carry out the implementation plan to resolve the year date issue which it developed as a result of the assessment 
the year problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
any of the company s programs that have time sensitive software may recognize the date as the year rather than the year this could result in system failure or miscalculations 
the company is utilizing and will utilize both internal and external resources to identify  correct or reprogram  and test the systems for year compliance 
the company has divided its year compliance program into the following phases assessment  planning  remediation and testing 
as of december   the company was complete with its year compliance program and anticipates being complete with all phases of the program by the second quarter of the company s year compliance program requires remediation of certain programs within particular time frames in order to avoid disruption of the company s operations 
these time frames include certain dates throughout although the company believes it will complete the remediation of these programs within the applicable time frames  there can be no assurance that such remediation will be completed or that the company s operations will not be disrupted to some degree 
the company is communicating with certain material vendors to determine the extent to which the company may be vulnerable to such vendors failure to resolve their own year issues 
the company is attempting to mitigate its risk with respect to the failure of such vendors to be year compliant by  among other things  requesting project plans  status reports and year compliance certifications or written assurances from its material vendors  including certain software vendors  business partners  landlords and suppliers 
the effect of such vendors noncompliance  if any  is not reasonably estimable at this time 
the company is required to submit periodic reports regarding year compliance to certain of the regulatory authorities which regulate its business 
the company is in compliance with such year reporting requirements 
such regulatory authorities have also asked the company to submit to certain audits regarding its year compliance 
the company is in the process of completing the modifications of its computer systems to accommodate the year and will undertake testing to ensure its systems and applications will function properly after december  the company currently expects this modification and testing to be completed in a time frame to avoid any material adverse effect on operations 
the company has deferred certain other information technology initiatives to concentrate on its year compliance efforts but the company believes that such deferral is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s inability to complete year modifications on a timely basis or the inability of other companies with which the company does business to complete their year modifications on a timely basis could adversely affect the company s operations 
the company expects to incur associated expenses of approximately million in to complete this effort 
as of december   the company had incurred approximately million of expenses in connection with its year compliance efforts 
the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the necessary year modifications are based on management s best estimate  which include assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
the company has contracted with an external consulting firm to assist in the generation of a year contingency plan in the event compliance is not achieved 
in connection therewith  the company has begun to identify reasonably likely scenarios which could arise in the event of the company s year noncompliance 
the company has completed a contingency strategy and will develop detailed plans to support this strategy 
the company expects to be substantially complete with these detailed plans by the second quarter of however  there can be no assurance that this contingency plan will be completed on a timely basis or that such a plan will protect the company from experiencing a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
potential consequences of the company s failure to timely resolve its year issues could include  among others i the inability to accurately and timely process claims  enroll and bill groups and members  pay providers  record and disclose accurate data and perform other core functions  ii increased scrutiny by regulators and breach of contractual obligations  and iii litigation in connection therewith 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes a significant amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risk 
since the substantial portion of the company s investments are in fixed rate debt securities  interest rate fluctuations represent the largest market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
interest rate risk is managed within a tight duration band  and credit risk is managed by investing in us government obligations and in corporate debt securities with high average quality ratings and maintaining a diversified sector exposure within the debt securities portfolio 
a hypothetical immediate increase of basis points in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s investments in debt securities as of december  by approximately million  while a basis points increase in rates would decrease the value of such investments by approximately million 
a hypothetical immediate decrease of basis points in market interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s investments in debt securities as of december  by approximately million  while a basis points decrease in rates would increase the value of such investments by approximately million 
the company s investment in equity securities as of december  was not significant 
the foregoing valuation estimates were based upon industry calculations of security durations and convexities as provided by such third party vendors as bloomberg and yield book 
due to the fact that durations and convexity are estimated rather than known quantities for certain securities  there can be no assurance that the company s portfolio would perform in line with the estimated values
