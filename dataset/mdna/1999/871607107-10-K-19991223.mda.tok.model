item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of for example  statements including terms such as projects  expects  believes  anticipates or targets are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under factors that may affect future results 
results of operations disposition of viewlogic pcb systems business effect on comparative financial information 
the company merged with viewlogic in december in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
on october   the company sold the printed circuit board and electronics systems business pcb systems business of viewlogic 
in the discussion below  financial information for fiscal excludes the pcb systems business  while financial information for fiscal includes the results of the pcb systems business 
therefore  the comparative measures included in the discussion  in particular with respect to absolute dollar amounts of revenue or expenditure  are not necessarily valid with respect to the company s business as it is presently conducted 
a pro forma unaudited consolidated statement of income  excluding the results of the pcb systems business and certain unusual charges  was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on form k on january  revenue 
revenue consists of fees for licenses and subscriptions of the company s software products  sales of system products  maintenance and support  customer training  and consulting 
the company s revenue increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and by from million in fiscal compared to fiscal the percentage of the company s total revenue attributable to software and system products increased to in fiscal from in fiscal and remained flat in fiscal compared with fiscal product revenue increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and by from million in fiscal compared to fiscal for each of the years  these increases were primarily due to increased worldwide licensing and sales of the company s eda software products such as synthesis  verification and system level design software products 
service revenue increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and by from million in fiscal compared to fiscal for each of the years  these increases were primarily attributable to the renewal of maintenance and support contracts for eda products and growth in customer training and consulting services 
revenue from international operations was million  million and million  or  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased demand for the company s products and services in the us and unchanged demand in japan 
the decrease in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to decreased revenue in asia pacific and japan as a result of the economic turmoil in many asia pacific markets 
this decrease was partially offset by growth in european revenue in fiscal cost of revenue 
cost of product revenue includes cost of production personnel  product packaging  documentation  amortization of capitalized software development costs and purchased technology  and costs of the company s system products 
the cost of internally developed capitalized software is amortized based on the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or the straight line method over the software s estimated economic life of approximately two years 
cost of product revenue remained relatively flat at of total revenue in fiscal compared to of total revenue in fiscal and of total revenue in fiscal the reduction from fiscal to fiscal was due to the company realizing efficiencies in its software distribution infrastructure 
cost of service revenue includes personnel and the related costs associated with providing training and consulting services 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal and of total revenue in both fiscal and the increase in cost of service from fiscal was due to the continued investment in the company s infrastructure required to expand its training and consulting practice 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and by from million in fiscal compared to fiscal  net of capitalized software development costs 
research and development expenses represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars reflects the company s ongoing research and development efforts in a wide variety of areas such as tools for the design of systems on a chip and physical design tools 
a significant portion of the increase for each fiscal year was due to the addition of personnel and personnel related costs  partly through acquisitions  for enhancement of existing applications and development of next generation products 
also  fiscal included an additional week of operations  which was partially offset by synergies realized from the integration of viewlogic into synopsys operations 
the company anticipates that it will continue to commit substantial resources to research and development in the future  provided that it is able to continue to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
if the company believes that it is unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner  it may license technology from other businesses or acquire other businesses as an alternative to internal research and development 
for fiscal  the company expects that research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue will be at or slightly below the fiscal level 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased by from million in fiscal compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
total expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily as a result of the divesture of the pcb systems business  as well as savings resulting from ongoing integration of viewlogic s other operations into the company as a whole 
these reductions were partially offset by increased spending in marketing and advertising costs  trade shows and travel related costs 
the fiscal increase over fiscal primarily resulted from the addition of personnel and personnel related costs due to the continued growth of the company s worldwide sales and marketing organizations and an increase in professional services 
fiscal also included an additional week of operations 
the company expects that for fiscal  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue will be at or slightly below the fiscal level 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal general and administrative expense decreased slightly from million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses included an additional week of operations  however  the associated expense increases were offset by synergies realized from the integration of viewlogic into synopsys operations 
the company expects that for fiscal  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue will be at or slightly below the fiscal level 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired by the company and  is being amortized over the estimated useful life of four to five years 
the company assesses the recoverability of intangible assets by determining whether the amortized asset over its useful life may be recovered through estimated useful cash flows 
a review of the intangible assets has been completed and it has been determined that the values are properly stated and no adjustments are required 
amortization of intangible assets charged to operations fiscal was million and was not material for fiscal or merger related and other costs 
as a result of various business combinations accounted for as pooling of interests in fiscal and  the company incurred merger related and other costs of million and million  respectively 
these expenses related to transaction costs  employee termination and transition costs  legal costs  write off of equipment and other assets  and redundant facility and other costs 
as of september   there was a balance of million remaining in accrued liabilities which was utilized for final settlement expenditures in october in process research and development 
the following paragraphs contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements and assumptions regarding percentage of completion  expected product release dates  dates for which we expect to begin generating benefits from projects  expected product capabilities and product life cycles  costs and efforts to complete projects  growth rates  royalty rates and projected revenue and expense information used by us to calculate discounted cash flows and discounts rates 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and the cautionary statements set forth below and in factors that may affect future results identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward looking statement 
purchased in process research and development iprd of million and million in fiscal and respectively  represents the write off of in process technologies associated with our acquisitions of gambit automated design  inc gambit  stanza systems  inc 
stanza  smartech  the rights to covermeter  a software product owned by advanced technology center  and apteq design systems  inc apteq  in fiscal and systems science  inc 
ssi and two privately held companies in fiscal collectively  the acquired companies 
at the date of each acquisition the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these amounts were expensed on the respective acquisition dates of each of the acquired companies 
also see note  business combinations 
valuation of iprd 
we calculated amounts allocated to iprd using established valuation techniques in the high technology industry and expensed such amounts in the quarter that each acquisition was consummated because technological feasibility had not been achieved and no alternative future uses had been established 
this approach gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles  and the estimated life of each products underlying technology 
the fair value of the in process technology was based on a discounted cash flow model  similar to the traditional income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value  net of tax 
in discounting the estimated cash flows  a discount rate of was used based on the risks associated with achieving such projected cash flows upon successful completion of the acquired projects  expected incremental revenues and expenses associated with the projects utilizing the acquired technology  and risks and uncertainties in incorporating the acquired technology into the company s development projects 
in developing cash flow projections  revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors  including aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  characteristics of the potential market for the technology and the anticipated life of the technology 
projected annual revenues for the in process research and development projects were assumed to ramp up initially and decline significantly at the end of the in process technology s economic life 
operating expenses and resulting profit margins were forecasted based on the characteristics and cash flow generating potential of the acquired in process technology 
gross profit percentage and tax rate were assumed to approximate the company s corporate gross profit percentage average and its effective tax rate 
associated risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in the market conditions and technology 
we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions or synergies  therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings 
as of september   the company s research and development expenditures since the acquisitions of fiscal have not differed materially from expectations 
the projections the company used in performing its valuations with respect to each acquisition are still valid  in all material respects  however  there can be no assurance that the projected results will be achieved 
with respect to the company s acquisitions completed in fiscal  management believes that the projections the company used in performing its valuations with respect to each acquisition are still valid  in all material respects  however  there can be no assurance that the projected results will be achieved 
management expects to continue the development of each project and believes that there is a reasonable chance of successfully completing such development efforts 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the in process projects and there can be no assurance that any project will meet with either technological or commercial success 
failure to successfully develop and commercialize these in process projects would result in the loss of the expected economic return inherent in the fair value allocation 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
the risks associated with the research and development are still considered high and no assurance can be made that upcoming products will meet market expectations 
as of september   and for each of the three fiscal years then ended  the impact upon our consolidated results of operations or financial position with respect to the success  or lack thereof  related to any acquisition  individually or in aggregate  is not considered material 
other income  net 
other income  net was million  million and million  or  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
other income  net increased in each fiscal year primarily due to higher average invested cash and short term investment balances  which yielded more interest income for fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  in fiscal  and other income  net increased due to gains realized on sales of equity investments 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its investment portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company places its investments in a mix of tax exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in the company s investment policy 
the policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
the company does not anticipate any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for the company s investment portfolio 
the carrying value approximates fair value at september  in accordance with the company s investment policy  all investments mature in fifteen months or less 
principal notional amounts in us dollars carrying average amount interest rate in thousands  except interest rates cash equivalents fixed rate  short term investments fixed rate  total investment securities  money market funds variable rate  total interest bearing instruments  see note in accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on investment maturity dates  long term debt and equity price risk related to the company s long term investments 
foreign currency risk 
at the present time  the company hedges only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and does not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
hedging activities are undertaken by the company and are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on these balances 
the success of this activity depends upon estimations of intercompany balances denominated in various currencies  primarily the japanese yen  british pound sterling  german mark  french franc and italian lira 
the company had contracts for the sale and purchase of foreign currencies with a notional value expressed in us dollars of million 
these contracts were denominated in currencies which approximated the fair value of such contracts and their underlying transactions as of september  looking forward  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments 
there can be no assurance in the future that these hedging transactions will be effective 
the following table provides information about the company s foreign exchange forward contracts at september  due to the short term nature of these contracts  the contract rate approximates the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate and the amount in us dollars approximates the fair value of the contract at september  these forward contracts mature in approximately thirty days 
short term forward contracts to sell and buy foreign currencies in us dollars related to intercompany balances contract amount rate in thousands  except for average contract rates forward contracts japanese yen  british pound sterling 
german mark  french franc  italian lira  the unrealized gains losses on the outstanding forward contracts at september  were immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the realized gain losses on these contracts as they matured was not material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows for the periods presented 
extraordinary items 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt of million  net of income tax expense of million  related to the cancellation of certain interest bearing notes issued by the company to international business machines corporation ibm 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  synopsys completed the partial spin off of viewlogic systems  inc vsi  a company that owns the printed circuit board pcb systems business of viewlogic 
synopsys merger with viewlogic in december was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the spin off was accounted for as an extraordinary item  as provided by paragraph of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  and synopsys recorded an extraordinary gain  net of income tax expense  of million in fiscal in respect to the spin off 
synopsys retained common stock equal to percent of the fully diluted equity in vsi 
the company concluded that the disposition of vsi was consistent with its treatment of the synopsys viewlogic merger as a pooling of interests 
a condition of the pooling of interests treatment is that at the time of the merger  management did not plan to dispose of any significant part of the assets of the merged entity 
the company concluded that this condition was met because  on the date of the synopsys viewlogic merger  the company did not plan to dispose of the pcb systems business 
the company believed that there would be synergies between the company s high level integrated circuit design products and vsi s pcb design products 
the ultimate decision to spin off vsi was based on changes in circumstances following the synopsys viewlogic merger 
during the months following the merger  the company came to realize that certain of its assumptions and expectations regarding the operation of the pcb systems business as part of synopsys were not being fulfilled 
the company s initial intent to retain vsi altered due to changes in circumstances as follows a number of engineers working in the pcb systems business were hired by competitors  and management became concerned that it would lose more if the business remained part of synopsys 
certain synergies anticipated from operation of the pcb systems business as part of synopsys did not materialize 
the revenues of the pcb systems business grew more slowly than those of synopsys other businesses 
management concluded that the reduction in the company s overall growth rate caused by the pcb systems business was contributing to a market discounting of the company s stock value 
managers of the pcb systems business concluded that the business could grow faster if it was a stand alone entity  which would allow them to attract and retain key employees 
accordingly  synopsys has not changed its accounting for the viewlogic merger and has reported the gain on the vsi disposition as an extraordinary item 
accounting pronouncements during fiscal  the company early adopted statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement requires computer software costs incurred during the application development stage to be capitalized and amortized to operations over the software s estimated useful life 
the effect of adopting sop for fiscal was not material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends the effective date of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and requires the company to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value 
gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value would be accounted for based on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company will adopt sfas no 
as required for its fiscal annual report on form k 
the company has not determined the impact that sfas no 
will have on its financial statements and believes that such determination will not be meaningful until closer to the date of the initial adoption 
in december  the aicpa issued sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  which amends sop and supercedes sop the company will adopt sop in fiscal the company intends to modify certain aspects of its license and pricing structure so that the impact of sop on its revenue recognition practices will not be significant 
in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
requires disclosure of certain information regarding operating segments  products and services  geographic areas of operation  and major customers 
the company has adopted sfas no 
as required for its fiscal annual report on form k 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at september   an increase of million or from fiscal the increase is primarily a result of cash generated by operations of million  and to a lesser extent  through financing and investing activities  mainly the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock through the employee stock purchase plan of million and the sale of long term investments of million 
these cash flows were partially offset by cash outflows for investing and financing activities  mainly capital expenditures of million  acquisitions valued at million  the repurchase of common stock of million and cash paid on debt obligations of million 
accounts receivable increased during fiscal  while sales grew by 
days sales outstanding in receivables increased to days as of september  from days at september  as of september  and  the company had sold million and million of its accounts receivable to a financial institution 
at september   the company had two foreign exchange lines of credit available totaling million  which expire in july and october the company s management believes that its current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  lines of credit  and cash generated from operations will satisfy its expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
year readiness this section contains forward looking statements 
see factors that may affect future results 
year problem 
the failure of a computer program to accurately recognize and process date information beginning on january  is referred to as a year problem 
this may result in a system failure  miscalculation or other malfunction 
synopsys has potential year problems both as a vendor of software and as a user of software and other services 
as a vendor  synopsys could have year issues either if our software products were not year compliant or our customers had year issues that interfered with their purchases of synopsys products 
our business could also be disrupted if any of the many systems we use to perform key corporate functions such as financial accounting  billing  payroll or license control  or the power  telecommunications and other services they depend on were interrupted or damaged as a result of year problems 
for the purposes of the following discussion  our efforts to identify  assess  fix and test year problems relating to our business are referred to as our year efforts 
state of readiness 
in general  synopsys products are not date sensitive  and therefore are less likely to have year problems 
we have inspected or tested all of our currently released products to determine whether they have year problems 
none of our tested products experienced significant date related failures 
in addition  we are operating a dedicated year test laboratory  which we use to test new products and maintain year compliance of future products 
synopsys has taken a number of steps to determine whether the internal computer systems and software we rely upon to run our business will have year problems 
our efforts have covered both systems that are commonly thought of as information technology it systems  including accounting  data processing  and telephone pbx systems  as well as certain systems that are not commonly thought of as it systems  such as alarm systems and fax machines 
our year efforts are being conducted primarily by synopsys employees and in synopsys facilities 
we began our year efforts in february as of september   we had completed approximately of the total effort for the projects we believe are necessary to fully address potential year issues relating to our internal computer systems and software 
our remaining efforts are focused on upgrading certain desktop computers and servers for which we delayed remediation work to enable us to provide support to customers using synopsys products on prior releases of their operating systems 
in addition to conducting an assessment of our products and internal systems and software  we have conducted a survey of our most important vendors and service providers 
all such vendors have indicated that they are year compliant 
certain of our computer equipment and software has required replacement or modification as a result of year issues  including an upgrade to the windows operating system and related modifications affecting most of the desktop computers used in our business 
in certain instances  a replacement or modification anticipated in the ordinary course of business was accelerated due to year issues 
costs of readiness 
synopsys has not incurred  and does not expect to incur  material expense in connection with our year efforts 
we currently estimate that the total cost of our year efforts will not exceed million  consisting of approximately million for hardware  software and external consultants external costs  and approximately million in direct costs of employees working on our year efforts internal costs 
as of september  we had incurred costs of approximately million related to our year efforts  including million in external costs and million in internal costs 
the company expects to incur additional depreciation expenses of million and additional personnel costs of approximately million relating to its year efforts 
however  should we encounter unforeseen year problems  either in our products or internal systems or in our customers or vendors operations  the amount we spend on our year efforts number could increase  perhaps by a material amount 
the cost of our year efforts is being funded from operating cash flows 
these costs represent approximately of our total actual and anticipated it expenditures for the period from the start of fiscal through march  including employee expenses of our it department 
expansion and upgrade of our internal systems unrelated to our year efforts have not been materially delayed or impacted by our year efforts 
contingency plans 
synopsys has analyzed the operational problems that would be reasonably likely to result from the failure by us or vendors to achieve year compliance on a timely basis 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario we have identified is a disruption of our core operational functions for one week 
in conjunction with our overall crisis planning efforts  we have developed a plan to address this scenario and to reduce the risk of other year related problems 
under this plan  the company will partially shut down certain internal systems during the year rollover and use standby electric generators to power key systems in case of a public utility power outage 
while we do not anticipate that this scenario will have a material adverse effect on our business  we are not able to predict the likelihood or the effects of the worst case scenario with certainty 
factors that may affect future results our revenue and earnings may fluctuate 
many factors affect our revenue and earnings  which makes it difficult to achieve predictable revenue and earnings growth 
among these factors are customer product and service demand  product license terms  and the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold 
the following specific factors could affect our revenues and earnings in a particular quarter or over several quarterly or annual periods our orders have been seasonal 
historically  our first fiscal quarter has been our weakest  with a book to bill ratio less than the recent change in our fiscal year see note in accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements may affect the seasonal pattern of our revenues 
our products are complex  and before buying them customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing them 
our customers evaluation and purchase cycles do not necessarily match our quarterly periods  and if by the end of any quarter we have not sold enough new licenses  our orders and revenues could be below our plan 
like many companies in the software industry  in the past we have received a disproportionate volume of orders in the last week of a quarter  and recognized a disproportionate amount of revenue in the last week of a quarter 
in addition  a large proportion of our business is attributable to our largest customers 
as a result  if any order  and especially a large order  is delayed beyond the end of a fiscal period  our orders and revenue for that period could be below our plan 
the accounting rules we are required to follow permit us to recognize revenue only when certain criteria are met 
orders for certain of our products and services yield revenue over multiple quarters often extending beyond the current fiscal year or upon completion of performance rather than at the time of sale 
in addition  the specific terms agreed to with a customer may have the effect of requiring deferral of revenue in whole or in part or  alternatively  of permitting us to accelerate the recognition of revenue for products to be used over multiple years 
a number of our recent transactions have involved multi year licenses with respect to which a significant portion of the revenue was recognized in the initial quarter consistent with relevant accounting rules 
therefore  for a given quarter it is possible for us to fall short in our revenue and or earnings plan even while orders and backlog remain on plan or  conversely  to meet our revenue and or earnings plan by drawing on backlog and deferred revenue while orders are under plan 
we recently introduced a new license and pricing structure for our software products 
although we believe that these changes have benefits for both synopsys and our customers  it is possible that customer reaction will be unfavorable or that the transition to the new structure will be disruptive to business  resulting in the deferral or loss of sales 
our industry is highly competitive 
the eda industry is highly competitive 
we compete against other eda vendors  and with customers internally developed design tools and internal design capabilities  for a share of the overall eda budgets of our potential customers 
in general  competition is based on product quality and features  post sale support  price and  as discussed below  the ability to offer a complete design flow 
our competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services  such as cadence mentor and avant  as well as companies  including numerous start up companies  that offer products focused on a discrete phase of the integrated circuit design process 
synopsys competitors continue to offer aggressive discounts on their products  in particular on synthesis and verilog simulation products 
if this behavior continues  average prices for our products may fall 
in order to compete successfully  we must continue to enhance our products and bring to market new products that address the needs of our customers 
we also will have to expand our consulting services business 
the failure to enhance existing products  develop and or acquire new products or expand our ability to offer consulting services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
technology advances and customer requirements are fueling a change in the nature of competition among eda vendors 
increasingly  eda companies compete on the basis of design flows involving integrated logic and physical design tools rather than on the basis of individual point tools performing a discrete phase of the design process 
the need to offer products linking logic and physical design will become increasingly important  as ic complexity is increasing  chip production moves increasingly to micron and below  and system on a chip designs become more prevalent 
we offer a wide range of logic design tools but have only recently introduced our first physical design tools 
we are working on completing our design flow  although for the foreseeable future will not be able to offer such a flow to customers 
the market for physical design tools is dominated by cadence and avant both companies have acquired logic synthesis technology and are offering products linking synthesis to their physical design products 
if we are unsuccessful in developing a complete design flow on a timely basis or in convincing customers to adopt our physical design products and methodology  our competitive position could be significantly weakened 
our revenue growth depends on our non synthesis products 
historically  much of our growth has been attributable to the strength of our logic synthesis products 
opportunities for growth in market share in this area are limited  and revenues from our synthesis products are expected to grow more slowly than our target for overall revenue growth 
in order to meet our revenue plan  revenue from our non synthesis design creation products  certain high level verification products  physical design products  deep submicron products and professional services must grow faster than our overall revenue growth target 
among the products that we expect to be the most important contributors to revenue growth are our primetime r timing analysis  vcs tm verilog simulation  formality r formal verification  module compiler tm datapath synthesis  chip architect design planning  flexroute top level routing  physical compiler and epic r deep submicron analysis and verification products 
if revenue growth for these products fails to meet our goals  it is unlikely that we will meet our overall revenue growth target 
in order to sustain revenue growth over the long term  we will have to introduce new products that are accepted by a broad range of customers and to significantly expand our consulting services business 
product success is difficult to predict 
the introduction of new products and growth of a market for such products cannot be assured 
in the past we  like all companies  have had products that have failed to meet our revenue expectations 
expanding revenue from consulting services will require us to recruit  hire and train a large number of skilled employees  and to implement management controls on bidding and executing on consulting engagements 
the consulting business is significantly different from the software business  however  and increasing consulting orders and revenue while maintaining an adequate level of profit can be difficult 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in expanding revenue from existing or new products at the desired rate or in expanding our services business  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
businesses we acquire may not perform as projected 
we have acquired or merged with a number of companies in recent years  including epic design technology  inc  viewlogic  systems science  inc  everest  gambit  smartech  stanza and apteq  and as part of our efforts to increase revenue and expand our product and services offerings we may acquire additional companies 
in addition to direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including potential dilution of earnings per share  delays and other problems of integrating the acquired products and employees into our business  the failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings  the failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  the drain on management time for acquisition related activities  possible adverse effects on customer buying patterns due to uncertainties resulting from an acquisition  and assumption of unknown liabilities 
while we attempt to review proposed acquisitions carefully and negotiate terms that are favorable to synopsys  there is no assurance that any individual acquisition will have the projected effect on our performance 
our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics businesses 
our business has benefited from the rapid worldwide growth of the semiconductor industry 
purchases of our products are largely dependent upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers and the increasing complexity of designs 
while a number of semiconductor market segments are growing at a healthy pace  the overall outlook for the semiconductor industry remains uncertain 
renewed growth in the semiconductor industry will not necessarily lead to increases in purchases of synopsys products 
in addition  demand may be affected by mergers in the semiconductor and systems industries  which may reduce the aggregate level of purchases of our products and services by the combined companies 
slower growth in the semiconductor and systems industries  a reduced number of design starts  tightening of customers operating budgets or continued consolidation among our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
continued stagnation of international economies will adversely affect our performance 
international revenue is vulnerable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and in regional or worldwide economic or political conditions 
since the beginning of the asian economic crisis  international revenue has declined significantly as a percentage of overall revenue  as asian customers have deferred their investments in semiconductor facilities and technology 
it will be difficult to sustain our overall growth rate if revenue from asia remains stagnant or grows slowly 
in particular if the japanese economy remains weak  revenue from japan and the rest of asia will be adversely affected 
in addition  the yen dollar exchange rate remains subject to unpredictable fluctuations 
weakness of the yen could adversely affect revenue from japan during future quarters 
korea s ongoing economic weakness has had  and is likely to continue to have a significant adverse effect on our orders and revenue from korea 
in addition  two of our four largest korean customers have merged  which may result in a lower level of orders from the combined company than we might have received if the two companies remained separate 
asian countries other than japan and korea also have experienced economic and currency problems 
if such conditions persist  orders and revenues from the asia pacific region would be adversely affected 
our success depends on recruiting and retaining key personnel 
our success is dependent on technical and other contributions of key employees 
we participate in a dynamic industry  with significant start up activity  and our headquarters is in silicon valley  where skilled technical  sales and management employees are in high demand 
there are a limited number of qualified eda engineers  and the competition for such individuals is intense 
experience at synopsys is highly valued in the eda industry  and our employees are recruited aggressively by our competitors and by start up companies  including those in internet related businesses 
our salaries are competitive in the market  but under certain circumstances  start up companies can offer more attractive stock option packages 
as a result  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  significant employee turnover 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we can continue to recruit and retain key personnel or that it can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 
failure to successfully recruit and retain such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on proprietary technology 
our success is dependent  in part  upon our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or acquire similar techniques or gain access to our proprietary technology or that we can protect our rights to our technology 
we rely on confidentiality agreements with collaborators  employees  vendors and consultants to protect our proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
failure to obtain or maintain patent or trade secret protection  for any reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations of future revenue  and expense levels are generally committed in advance of revenue 
we expect to continue to increase operating expenses in order to generate and support continued growth in revenue 
if we were unsuccessful in generating such revenue  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
net income in a given quarter or fiscal year may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue growth because only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue 
anti takeover provisions 
we have adopted a number of provisions that could have anti takeover effects 
the board of directors has adopted a preferred shares rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
in addition  the board of directors has the authority  without further action by its stockholders  to issue additional shares of common stock and to fix the rights and preferences of  and to issue authorized but undesignated shares of preferred stock 
these and other provisions of synopsys restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of synopsys  including transactions in which the shareholders of the company might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
year problems 
we are uncertain as to the year readiness of our customers  and if one or more important customers were to experience year related problems that interfered with their purchases of synopsys products  our revenues could be reduced  perhaps materially 
in addition  if our plan to address failures caused by year problems  including disruptions of our power supply  increased hacker or computer virus activity or internal systems failures not remediated by our year efforts  proved unsuccessful  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
