this increase can primarily be attributed to the accretive acquisitions of chart marston and cryenco and the highly profitable orders received in for industrial gas and hydrocarbon processing equipment  including heat exchangers  cold boxes  cryogenic tanks and assorted system components 
the tremendous increase in demand experienced in prior years for both industrial gas and hydrocarbon processing equipment sold by the company s ps e and ds a segments slowed down in new orders in these two segments were million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
backlog in these two segments at december  totaled million and the company s total consolidated backlog was million

sales in the ds a segment increased million over the prior year  primarily on the strength of industrial gas equipment sales at cryenco  which were up million

the gross margin increased from percent in to percent in as in sales  a large portion of the improvement in both gross profit and in gross margin came from the ps e segment 
the most dramatic improvement came as a result of increased volume and price in the brazed aluminum heat exchanger market 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense totaled million for  an increase of million from the increase in sg a expense is largely driven by the variable expenses of profit sharing  management incentive compensation and selling commissions  all of which are closely tied to profitability and sales levels

as a percentage of sales  sg a expense increased from percent in to percent in the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales in is partially caused by expenses related to merger and acquisition activity the company engaged in throughout the year 
net interest expense increased to  during from  during the increase in interest expense is due to the increase in debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of chart marston 
as a result of the continued growth of the company s brazed aluminum heat exchanger operations and the addition of chart marston  total employment increased percent to  employees

years ended december  and sales for were million  an increase of million or percent over by far  the largest increase in sales occurred in the ps e segment  with sales exceeding sales by million  of which million was attributable to increased sales of brazed aluminum heat exchangers and the remainder to increased sales of cold box assemblies 
sales in the ds a segment increased million over the prior year  almost entirely in cryogenic tanks and trailers  primarily due to the acquisition of cryenco 
special products sales increased by million in much of the sales improvement in this segment is the result of vacuum equipment being supplied to the ligo project  the sales of which totaled approximately million during  as well as increased sales of cryogenic components

the gross margin increased from percent in to percent in as in sales  a large portion of the improvement in both gross profit and in gross margin came from the ps e segment 
the most dramatic improvement came as a result of increased volume and price in the brazed aluminum heat exchanger market 
however  the cold box engineering and fabrication market also responded with better productivity and volume 
selling  general and administrative expense totaled million for  an increase of million from however  as a percentage of sales  sg a expense decreased from percent in to percent in this improvement is the result of increasing volume relative to the fixed overhead 
the million increase in sg a expense is largely driven by the variable expenses of profit sharing  management incentive compensation and selling commissions  all of which are closely tied to profitability and sales levels 
in addition  the acquisition of cryenco added million of sg a expense during the five months its results were included in the company s results 
net interest expense declined during the expense is related both to the debt resulting from the acquisition of cryenco  which was outstanding for approximately one quarter before the proceeds from the stock offering were used to pay down all borrowings under the credit facility  and the irb which remained outstanding throughout the year

year readiness disclosure the year problem is the result of the inability of hardware  software and control systems to properly recognize and process two digit references to specific years  beginning with the year the year problem could result in system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of the operations of the company  its suppliers and its customers 
in  the company completed a preliminary assessment of its critical software systems and determined that none of these systems could not be made compliant 
in june  the company initiated a formal assessment plan for all non critical software systems by identifying a lead person at each of its locations to be responsible for ensuring that the location will be compliant 
the first phase of the formal assessment plan  which was completed in the third quarter of  included an inventory of all information technology systems and control systems with embedded chip technology 
results of the inventory indicated that all information technology systems are or should be compliant by the year  primarily because none of these systems involve internally developed software and compliant versions are readily available 
the company produces a limited number of products utilizing control systems with embedded chip technology  and is contacting the vendors who provide these embedded chips to determine compliance 
this project will be completed in the second quarter of based upon the company s review of systems using embedded chip technology within its existing facilities  the company is reasonably sure that its facilities are materially year compliant 
the company believes that the third parties whose year problems pose the greatest risks for the company include its banks that maintain depository accounts  its payroll processing company  its suppliers of the major materials used in production processes  its utility providers and its providers of freight services 
the company has communicated with these third parties to determine if they have an effective plan in place to address the year problem  and has received positive responses from the majority of these third parties 
however  the company provides no assurance that these third parties will be year compliant or that their noncompliance will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company currently estimates that it will spend less than million to ensure that its information technology systems are compliant  of which more than half has been committed or spent through december  accordingly  the company expects cash flow from operations and available borrowings to be sufficient to fund these expenditures 
based upon the results of year compliance efforts underway  the company believes that all critical information technology systems and control systems with embedded chip technology will be compliant and will allow the company to continue to operate beyond the year without a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position 
however  unanticipated problems which may be identified in the ongoing year preparation program could result in an undetermined financial risk 
based upon the company s assessment of its year compliance and the indicated compliance of the third parties it has contacted to date  the company is developing contingency plans as deemed necessary
