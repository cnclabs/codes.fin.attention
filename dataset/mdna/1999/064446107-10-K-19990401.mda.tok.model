the process may be extended in the event the borrower files bankruptcy or the bank enters into negotiations with the borrower for a loan restructure or workout 
regulation and practices regarding the foreclosure of properties and the rights of the borrower in default vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
loans originated by the bank are secured by mortgages  deeds of trust  security deeds or deeds to secure debt  based upon the prevailing practice in the state in which the property securing the loan is located 
depending upon local law  foreclosure is effected by judicial action and or non judicial sale  and is subject to various notice and filing requirements 
in california  where the majority of the bank s collateral is located  foreclosure proceedings usually take the form of a nonjudicial foreclosure  which is typically a four month process 
upon completion  the bank obtains title to the collateral but is left generally without recourse against the borrower for any deficiency from the difference between the value of the collateral and the loan amount 
properties are managed prior to and post foreclosure sale with the objective of maximizing the return on each individual asset 
this strategy includes loan modifications  short sales  deeds in lieu of foreclosure and rehabilitation of certain properties when the investment significantly increases the net yield on the asset 
the bank may agree to restructure the loan if it determines that the loan  as modified  is likely to result in a greater ultimate recovery than taking title to the property

credit administration the credit administration function is responsible for monitoring and assessing the credit risk in the bank s loan portfolio 
this includes the identification  measurement and establishment of credit loss reserves  including the allowance for loan and lease losses alll and specific valuation allowances svas 
loan monitoring the bank has a loan review system that is designed to meet the following objectives o to identify  in a timely manner  loans with potential credit or collateral weaknesses and to appropriately classify loans with well defined weaknesses that jeopardize loan repayment so that timely action can be taken and credit losses can be mitigated 
o to project relevant trends that affect the collectibility of the loan portfolio and to isolate potential problem areas that may exhibit adverse trends 
o to provide essential information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and to identify and recognize in a timely manner estimated specific loan losses 
o to assess the adequacy of and adherence to the bank s internal credit policies and loan administration procedures and to monitor compliance with the foregoing and with relevant laws and regulations 
the bank considers such risk factors as payment history  collateral value  income property cash flow  property condition  and the borrower s financial capacity and property management experience in its monitoring and risk grading process 
loan grading system the bank has a loan grading policy which is implemented through a loan grading system lgs 
the evaluation of each loan is based on four key risk attributes ability of income from the property to act as the primary source of repayment  value of the collateral if a sale is required  ability and willingness of the borrower to pay  and market trends in the area around the property 
grading loans involves assessing various risk indicators related to the borrower 
for income properties  the primary source of repayment is cash flow from the operation of the property 
the adequacy of the property s cash flow is the primary determinant of the risk grade 
the borrowers historical payment performance  including loan payments  tax payments  insurance payments and property maintenance  is also reviewed when determining a loan grade 
the absence of borrower performance indicates a lack of capacity and possible downgrade of the loan 
the value of the collateral is considered a secondary source of repayment which becomes more important when the primary sources become weaker 
the collateral value can influence the primary repayment source by motivating the borrower to continue supporting the property or impacting the borrower s ability to refinance the loan 
credit risk is graded based on the bank s internal asset review policies and procedures  and individual loans are categorized as pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss depending on the risk characteristics of each loan 
all such grading requires the application of subjective judgment by the bank 
a brief description of these categories follows a pass asset is considered of sufficient quality to preclude designation as special mention or a substandard asset 
pass assets generally are protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor and by the value of the underlying collateral 
an asset designated as special mention does not currently expose the institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification 
however  it does possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
if uncorrected  such weaknesses or deficiencies may expose an institution to an increased risk of loss in the future 
special mention assets are also referred to as criticized 
an asset classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged 
assets so classified have a well defined weakness or weaknesses 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard 
in addition  these weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable or improbable 
the bank will generally classify assets as doubtful when inadequate data is available or when such uncertainty exists as to preclude a substandard classification 
assets classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without establishment of a specific reserve is not warranted 
a loss classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value  rather it means that it is not practical or desirable to defer establishing a specific allowance for a basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future 
the bank will generally classify as loss the portion of assets identified as exceeding the asset s fair market value and a specific reserve is established for such excess

the fhlb system functions as a source of credit to financial institutions which are members of a federal home loan bank 
fidelity may apply for advances from the fhlb secured by the capital stock of the fhlb owned by fidelity and certain of fidelity s mortgages and other assets principally obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government or agencies thereof 
advances can be requested for any business purpose in which fidelity is authorized to engage  except that advances with a term greater than five years can be granted only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
in granting advances  the fhlb considers a member s creditworthiness and other relevant factors

in both these areas  the company faces significant competition from thrifts  commercial banks  mortgage bankers and others 
competition is based primarily on pricing  credit access and customer service 
partly because of the competition in southern california and in lending to customers with higher credit quality  the company has expanded its origination activities beyond its local market and to customers with lower credit quality 
this has put the company in competition with local  regional and national companies for lending opportunities 
a number of these competitors have significantly more resources than the company  including larger asset bases  more equity  more locations and more employees 
the company has an established retail branch system in southern california upon which it relies for its deposits 
because these deposits are heavily concentrated in certificates of deposit rather than transaction accounts  the company s deposit base is more sensitive to changes in interest rates

competition for customers deposits is based on interest rates paid  perceived credit risk  account flexibility  costs and customer service 
the company faces significant competition in attracting funds from other thrifts  commercial banks  mutual funds  insurance companies  credit unions  investment banks  investment brokerage firms  pension funds and others 
a number of competitors are significantly larger than the company  maintain a better credit standing and are able to pay higher rates of return to customers

the director of the ots may only approve acquisitions resulting in the formation of a multiple savings and loan holding company which controls savings institutions in more than one state if i the multiple savings and loan holding company involved controls a savings institution which operated a home or branch office located in the state of the institution to be acquired as of march   ii the acquiror is authorized to acquire control of the savings institution pursuant to the emergency acquisition provisions of the federal deposit insurance act fdia  or iii the statutes of the state in which the institution to be acquired by the state chartered institutions or savings and loan holding companies located in the state where the acquiring entity is located or by a holding company that controls such state chartered savings institutions 
fidelity regulation capital requirements and capital categories firrea capital requirements 
the ots capital regulations  as required by the financial institutions reform  recovery  and enforcement act of firrea  include three separate minimum capital requirements for the savings institution industry a tangible capital requirement  a leverage limit and a risk based capital requirement 
these capital standards must be no less stringent than the capital standards applicable to national banks 
the ots also has the authority  after giving the affected institution notice and an opportunity to respond  to establish an individual minimum capital requirement imcr for a savings institution which is higher than the industry minimum requirements  upon a determination that an imcr is necessary or appropriate in light of the institution s particular circumstances  such as if the institution is expected to have losses resulting in capital inadequacy  has a high degree of exposure to credit risk  has a high amount of nonperforming loans  has a high degree of exposure to concentration of credit risk or risks arising from nontraditional activities  or fails to adequately monitor and control the risks presented by concentration of credit and nontraditional activities 
the industry minimum capital requirements are as follows tangible capital of at least of adjusted tangible assets 
tangible capital is composed of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related earnings  nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits qualifying as core capital and minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated subsidiaries  after deducting a intangible assets other than certain purchased or originated mortgage servicing rights  b equity and debt investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank except as otherwise provided  and c the amount by which investments in subsidiaries engaged as principal in activities not permissible for national banks exceeds the amount of such investments as of april  and the lesser of the institution s investments in and extensions of credit to such subsidiaries  net of any reserves established against such investments  i as of april  and ii as of the date on which the institution s tangible capital is being determined 
in general  adjusted tangible assets equal the institution s consolidated tangible assets  minus any assets that are deducted in calculating capital 
core capital of at least of adjusted tangible assets the leverage limit 
core capital consists of tangible capital plus qualifying goodwill resulting from pre april  acquisitions of troubled savings institutions and certain qualifying intangible assets and mortgage servicing rights 
certain deferred tax assets must also be deducted from core capital 
total capital of at least of risk weighted assets the risk based capital requirement 
total capital includes both core capital and supplementary capital items deemed less permanent than core capital  such as subordinated debt and general loan loss allowances subject to certain limits 
equity investments with the exception of investments in subsidiaries and investments permissible for national banks and portions of certain high risk land loans and nonresidential construction loans must be deducted from total capital 
at least half of total capital must consist of core capital 
risk weighted assets are determined by multiplying each category of an institution s assets  including off balance sheet asset equivalents  by an assigned risk weight based on the credit risk associated with those assets  and adding the resulting products 
the four risk weight categories range from for cash and government securities to for assets including past due loans and real estate owned reo that do not qualify for preferential risk weighting 
on march   the ots published a final regulation effective on that date that permits a loan secured by multifamily residential property  regardless of the number of units  to be risk weighted at for purposes of the risk based capital standards if the loan meets specified criteria relating to the term of the loan  timely payments of interest and principal  loan to value ratio and ratio of net operating income to debt service requirements 
under the prior regulation  only loans secured by multifamily residential properties consisting of to units were eligible for risk weighting at  and then only if such loans had a loan to value ratio at origination of not more than and the collateral property had an average annual occupancy rate of at least for a year or more 
any loans that qualified for risk weighting under the prior regulation as of march  will be grandfathered and will continue to be risk weighted at as long as they continue to meet the criteria of the prior regulation 
thus occupancy rates  which recently have been decreasing generally  will continue to affect the risk weighting of such grandfathered multifamily loans unless such loans qualify for risk weighting under the criteria of the new rule  which criteria do not include an occupancy requirement 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  the ots was required to revise its risk based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and risks of nontraditional activities 
the ots has incorporated an interest rate risk component into its regulatory capital rule 
under the rule  savings institutions with above normal interest rate risk exposure would be subject to a deduction from total capital for purposes of calculating their risk based capital requirements 
an institution whose interest rate risk exposure measured as set forth in the rule exceeded would be required to deduct an interest rate risk component in calculating its total capital under the risk based capital rule 
the interest rate risk component is an amount equal to one half of the difference between the institution s measured interest rate risk and multiplied by the estimated economic value of the bank s assets 
that dollar amount would be deducted from a bank s total capital in calculating compliance with its risk based capital requirement 
under the rule  there is a lag between the reporting date of an institution s financial data and the effective date for the new capital requirement based on that data 
the rule also provides that the director of the ots may waive or defer a bank s interest rate risk component on a case by case basis 
the ots has postponed the implementation of the new rule until the ots has collected sufficient data to determine whether the rule is effective in monitoring and managing interest rate risk 
no interest rate risk component would have been required to be added to the bank s risk based capital requirement at december  had the rule been in effect at that time 
fdicia prompt correction action regulations 
fdicia required the ots to implement a system requiring regulatory sanctions against institutions that are not adequately capitalized  with the sanctions growing more severe the lower the institution s capital 
the ots has established specific capital ratios under the prompt corrective action pca regulations for five separate capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under the ots regulations implementing fdicia  an institution is treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of core capital to adjusted tangible assets is at least  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
an institution will be adequately capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is at least  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is at least  and its ratio of core capital to adjusted tangible assets leverage ratio is at least if the institution receives the highest rating on the ots financial institutions rating system 
an institution whose capital does not meet the amounts required in order to be adequately capitalized will be treated as undercapitalized 
if an undercapitalized institution s capital ratios are less than total capital to risk weighted assets  core capital to risk weighted assets  or core capital to adjusted tangible assets  it will be treated as significantly undercapitalized 
finally  an institution will be treated as critically undercapitalized if its ratio of tangible equity core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock minus intangible assets other than supervisory goodwill and certain originated and purchased mortgage servicing rights to adjusted tangible assets is equal to or less than 
at december   the bank was adequately capitalized 
see item md a regulatory capital compliance 
mandatory restrictions on undercapitalized institutions 
there are numerous mandatory restrictions on the activities of undercapitalized institutions 
an institution that is undercapitalized must submit a capital restoration plan to the ots that the ots may approve only if it determines that the plan is likely to succeed in restoring the institution s capital and will not appreciably increase the risks to which the institution is exposed 
in addition  the institution s performance under the plan must be guaranteed by every company that controls the institution  up to specified limits 
an institution that is undercapitalized may not acquire an interest in any company  open a new branch office or engage in a new line of business without ots or fdic approval 
an undercapitalized institution also may not increase its average total assets during any quarter except in accordance with an approved capital restoration plan 
an undercapitalized savings institution generally may not pay any dividends or make other capital distributions 
undercapitalized institutions also may not pay management fees to any company or individual that controls the institution 
an undercapitalized savings institution cannot accept  renew  or rollover deposits obtained through a deposit broker  and may not solicit deposits by offering interest rates that are more than basis points higher than market rates 
savings institutions that are adequately capitalized but not well capitalized must obtain a waiver from the fdic in order to accept  renew  or rollover brokered deposits  and even if a waiver is granted may not solicit deposits  through a broker or otherwise  by offering interest rates that exceed market rates by more than basis points 
restrictions on significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions 
in addition to the above mandatory restrictions which apply to all undercapitalized savings institutions  institutions that are significantly undercapitalized may not without the ots prior approval a pay a bonus to any senior executive officer or b increase any senior executive officer s compensation over the average rate of compensation excluding bonuses  options and profit sharing during the months preceding the month in which the institution became undercapitalized 
the same restriction applies to undercapitalized institutions that fail to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan 
if a savings institution is critically undercapitalized  the institution is also generally prohibited from making payments of principal or interest on subordinated debt beginning days after the institution becomes critically undercapitalized 
in addition  the institution cannot without prior fdic approval enter into any material transaction outside the ordinary course of business 
critically undercapitalized savings institutions must be placed in receivership or conservatorship within days of becoming critically undercapitalized unless the ots  with the concurrence of the fdic  determines that some other action would better resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long term loss to the insurance fund  and documents the reasons for its determination 
discretionary sanctions 
with respect to an undercapitalized institution  the ots  under certain circumstances  has the authority  among other things  to order the institution to recapitalize by selling shares of capital stock or other securities  order the institution to agree to be acquired by another depository institution holding company or combine with another depository institution  restrict transactions with affiliates  restrict the interest rates paid by the institution on new deposits to the prevailing rates of interest in the region where the institution is located  require the institution to divest any subsidiary or the institution s holding company to divest the institution or any other subsidiary or take any other action that the ots determines will better resolve the institution s problems at the least possible loss to the deposit insurance fund 
with respect to significantly undercapitalized institutions and certain undercapitalized institutions  the ots must take certain of the above mentioned actions 
in addition to the mandatory appointment of a conservator or receiver for critically undercapitalized institutions  described above  the ots or fdic may appoint a receiver or conservator for an undercapitalized institution if it a has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized  b fails to submit a capital restoration plan within the required time period or c materially fails to implement its capital restoration plan 
finally  the ots can apply to an institution in a particular capital category the sanctions that apply to the next lower capital category  if the ots determines  after providing the institution notice and opportunity for a hearing  that a the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or b the institution received  in its most recent report of examination  a less than satisfactory rating for asset quality  management  earnings or liquidity  and the deficiency has not been corrected 
the ots cannot  however  use this authority to require an adequately capitalized institution to file a capital restoration plan  or to subject a significantly undercapitalized institution to the sanctions applicable to critically undercapitalized institutions 
fidelity regulation activities regulation not related to capital compliance safety and soundness standards 
in addition to the pca provisions discussed above based on an institution s regulatory capital ratios  fdicia contains several measures intended to promote early identification of management problems at depository institutions and to ensure that regulators intervene promptly to require corrective action by institutions with inadequate operational and managerial standards 
fdicia requires the ots to prescribe minimum acceptable operational and managerial standards  and standards for asset quality  earnings  and valuation of publicly traded shares  for savings institutions and their holding companies 
the operational standards must cover internal controls  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth and employee compensation 
the asset quality and earnings standards must specify a maximum ratio of classified assets to capital  minimum earnings sufficient to absorb losses  and minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares 
any institution or holding company that fails to meet the standards must submit a plan for corrective action within days 
if a savings institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan  the ots must order it to correct the safety and soundness deficiency  and may restrict its rate of asset growth  prohibit asset growth entirely  require the institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets  restrict the interest rate paid on deposits to the prevailing rates of interest on deposits of comparable amounts and maturities  or require the institution to take any other action that the ots determines will better carry out the purpose of pca 
imposition of these sanctions is within the discretion of the ots in most cases but is mandatory if the savings institution commenced operations or experienced a change in control during the months preceding the institution s failure to meet the safety and soundness standards  or underwent extraordinary growth during the preceding months 
the ots has adopted guidelines for operational and managerial standards relating to internal controls  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits and excessive compensatory arrangements for executive officers  employees  directors or principal shareholders 
in addition  each depository institution with assets above million must annually prepare a report  signed by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  on the effectiveness of the institution s internal control structures and procedures for financial reporting  and on the institution s compliance with laws and regulations relating to safety and soundness 
the institution s independent public accountant must attest to  and report separately on  management s assertions in that report 
the report and the attestations  along with financial statements and such other disclosure requirements as the fdic and the ots may prescribe  must be submitted to the fdic and the ots 
such institutions must also have an audit committee of its board of directors made up entirely of directors who are independent of the management of the institution 
audit committees of large institutions defined by the fdic as an institution with more than billion in assets  which includes fidelity must include members with banking or financial management expertise  may not include members who are large customers of the institution  and must have access to independent counsel 
during the third quarter of  the ots completed its annual safety and soundness examination and the company has addressed the ots recommendations 
see item md a recent developments regulatory capital and supervision 
qualified thrift lender test 
the qtl test requires that  in at least nine out of every twelve months  at least of a savings bank s portfolio assets must be invested in a limited list of qualified thrift investments  primarily investments related to housing loans 
if fidelity fails to satisfy the qtl test and does not requalify as a qtl within one year  any entity in control of fidelity must register and be regulated as a bank holding company  and fidelity must either convert to a commercial bank charter or become subject to restrictions on branching  business activities and dividends as if it were a national bank 
portfolio assets consist of tangible assets minus a assets used to satisfy liquidity requirements and b property used by the institution to conduct its business 
in  the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act egrpra was adopted  amending the qtl requirements to allow educational loans  small business loans and credit card loans to count as qualified thrift assets without limit and to allow loans for personal  family or household purposes to count as qualified thrift assets in the category limited to of portfolio assets 
the previous limit for loans for personal  family or household purposes was also of portfolio assets 
finally  egrpra provided that as an alternative to the qtl test  thrifts may choose to comply with the internal revenue service s domestic building and loan tax code test 
investments and loans 
in general  federal savings institutions such as fidelity may not invest directly in equity securities  noninvestment grade debt securities or real estate  other than real estate used for the institution s offices and related facilities 
indirect equity investment in real estate through a subsidiary is permissible  but subject to certain limitations and deductions from regulatory capital 
loans by a savings institution to a single borrower are generally limited to of an institution s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  which is similar but not identical to total capital 
aggregate loans secured by nonresidential real property are generally limited to of an institution s total capital 
commercial loans may not exceed of an institution s total assets  and consumer loans may not exceed of an institution s total assets 
activities of subsidiaries 
a savings institution seeking to establish a new subsidiary  acquire control of an existing company or conduct a new activity through an existing subsidiary must provide days prior notice to the fdic and ots 
a subsidiary of fidelity may be able to engage in activities that are not permissible for fidelity directly  if the ots determines that such activities are reasonably related to fidelity s business  but fidelity may be required to deduct its investment in such a subsidiary from capital 
the ots has the power to require a savings institution to divest any subsidiary or terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the ots determines to be a serious threat to the financial safety  soundness or stability of such savings institution or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking practices 
real estate lending standards 
the ots and the other federal banking agencies have adopted regulations which require institutions to adopt and at least annually review written real estate lending policies 
the lending policies must include diversification standards  underwriting standards including loan to value limits  loan administration procedures  and procedures for monitoring compliance with the policies 
the policies must reflect consideration of guidelines adopted by the banking agencies 
among the guidelines adopted by the agencies are maximum loan to value ratios for unimproved land loans  development loans  construction loans  loans on owner occupied to family property  including home equity lines of credit no limit  but loans at or above require private mortgage insurance  and loans on other improved property 
the guidelines permit institutions to make loans in excess of the supervisory loan to value limits if such loans are supported by other credit factors  but the aggregate of such nonconforming loans should not exceed the institution s risk based capital  and the aggregate of nonconforming loans secured by real estate other than to family property should not exceed of risk based capital 
notification of new officers and directors 
a federal savings bank that does not comply with all minimum capital requirements under part of the ots regulations is deemed to be in troubled condition by the ots  or that has been notified by the ots in connection with the review of a capital restriction plan  or otherwise  that a notice must be provided must give the ots days notice prior to any change in its board of directors or its senior executive officers 
the ots must disapprove such change if the competence  experience or integrity of the affected individual indicates that it would not be in the best interests of the public to permit the appointment 
fidelity is currently subject to this notice requirement 
payment of dividends and other capital distributions 
the payment of dividends  stock repurchases  and other capital distributions by fidelity to bank plus is subject to regulation by the ots 
currently  days prior notice to the ots of any capital distribution is required 
the ots has promulgated a safe harbor regulation that permits capital distributions of certain amounts after providing notice to the ots  but without prior approval 
institutions can distribute amounts in excess of the safe harbor only with the prior approval of the ots 
for institutions tier institutions that meet their fully phased in capital requirements the requirements that will apply when the phase out of supervisory goodwill and investments in certain subsidiaries from capital is complete  the safe harbor amount is the greater of a of net income for the prior four quarters  or b the sum of the current year s net income and the amount that would reduce the excess of the institution s total capital to risk weighted assets ratio over to one half of such excess at the beginning of the year in which the dividend is paid 
for institutions that meet their current minimum capital requirements but do not meet their fully phased in requirements tier institutions  the safe harbor distribution is of net income for the prior four quarters reduced by prior distributions during the period 
savings institutions that do not meet their current minimum capital requirements before  or on a pro forma basis after giving effect to a proposed distribution  tier institutions may not make any capital distributions  with certain exceptions 
at december   fidelity was a tier institution 
the ots retains the authority to prohibit any capital distribution otherwise authorized under the regulation if the ots determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
the ots also may reclassify a tier institution as a tier or tier institution by notifying the institution that it is in need of more than normal supervision 
further  an adequately capitalized institution may not make a capital distribution if such payment would cause the institution to become undercapitalized 
the ots recently amended the capital distribution rule to conform to the pca system 
under the rule  an institution is able to make a capital distribution i without prior notice to the ots if it is not owned by a savings and loan holding company and  after the proposed capital distribution  will remain at least adequately capitalized  the distribution would not reduce the amount of common or preferred stock or retire debt that is included in capital  and the distribution would not otherwise violate any statutory regulatory or other prohibition  ii without an application if the institution has a composite rating of or  is otherwise eligible for expedited treatment and the distribution does not exceed a specified amount  and iii without notice or application if all of the conditions specified above are met 
fidelity is still required to obtain ots approval prior to making a capital distribution 
required liquidity 
ots regulations require savings institutions to maintain  for each calendar quarter  an average daily balance of liquid assets including cash  certain time deposits  bankers acceptances  certain mortgage related securities  certain loans secured by first liens on residential property  specified united states government  state and federal agency obligations  and balances maintained in satisfaction of the frb reserve requirements described below equal to at least of either i the prior quarter end balance of its net withdrawable accounts due in one year or less plus borrowings due in one year or less the liquidity base or ii the average daily balance of the liquidity base during the prior calendar quarter 
in addition  savings institutions must comply with a general non quantitative requirement to maintain a safe and sound level of liquidity 
the ots may change this liquidity requirement from time to time to an amount within a range of to of such accounts and borrowings depending upon economic conditions and the deposit flows of member institutions  and may exclude from the definition of liquid assets any item other than cash and the balances maintained in satisfaction of frb reserve requirements 
fidelity s average regulatory liquidity ratio for the fourth quarter of was  and accordingly fidelity was in compliance with the liquidity requirement 
monetary penalties may be imposed for failure to meet liquidity ratio requirements 
classification of assets 
savings institutions are required to classify their assets on a regular basis  to establish appropriate allowances for losses and report the results of such classification quarterly to the ots 
a savings institution is also required to set aside adequate valuation allowances  and to establish liabilities for off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit  when a loss becomes probable and estimable 
the ots has the authority to review the institution s classification of its assets and to determine whether additional assets must be classified  or the institution s valuation allowances must be increased 
see credit administration loan monitoring 
assets are classified as pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
an asset which possesses no apparent weakness or deficiency is designated satisfactory 
an asset which possesses weaknesses or deficiencies deserving close attention is designated as special mention 
an asset  or a portion thereof  is generally classified as substandard if it possesses a well defined weakness which could jeopardize the timely liquidation of the asset or realization of the collateral at the asset s book value 
thus  these assets are characterized by the possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
an asset  or portion thereof  is classified as doubtful if a probable loss of principal and or interest exists but the amount of the loss  if any  is subject to the outcome of future events which are indeterminable at the time of classification 
if an asset  or portion thereof  is classified as loss  the institution must either establish svas equal to the amount classified as loss or charge off such amount 
fidelity deposit insurance general 
fidelity s deposits are insured by the fdic to the maximum limits permitted by law 
under firrea  the fdic administers two separate deposit insurance funds the bank insurance fund bif which insures the deposits of institutions that were insured by the fdic prior to firrea  and the saif which maintains a fund to insure the deposits of institutions  such as fidelity  that were insured by the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic prior to firrea 
insurance premium assessments 
the fdicia directed the fdic to establish a risk based system for setting deposit insurance premium assessments 
the fdic has implemented such a system  under which an institution s insurance assessments will vary depending on the level of capital the institution holds and the degree to which it is the subject of supervisory concern to the fdic 
legislation was enacted on september  to address the disparity in bank and thrift deposit insurance premiums 
such legislation imposed a requirement on all saif member institutions to fully recapitalize the saif by paying a one time special assessment of approximately basis points on all assessable deposits as of march  this one time special assessment of basis points resulted in the bank recording million in additional saif premiums 
this legislation also altered the obligation with respect to the payment of interest on the debt obligations issued by the financing corporation fico debt and separated the assessments levied by the fdic for deposit insurance coverage from assessments to make such fico debt interest payments 
although the risk based assessment system for bank insurance fund bif members and for saif members  such as fidelity  provides for the same assessment rates for similarly rated institutions  federal law provides for different assessment rates for purposes of the fico debt interest payments to be paid on saif and bif deposits until december  or  if earlier  the date on which the last federal savings association ceases to exist 
under these provisions  saif deposits will be assessed at five times the rate at which bif deposits will be assessed 
currently  the saif assessment for purposes of paying fico debt interest is 
the issue of whether to extend the december   date for an additional three years has been raised in connection with pending federal banking legislation 
it is not possible to predict what federal legislation  if any  may be enacted on this  or any other  subject affecting the bank  bank plus  or any affiliate thereof 
as of december   the bank s core and risk based capital ratios are and  respectively  and the bank is adequately capitalized under the pca regulations 
termination of deposit insurance 
the fdic may initiate a proceeding to terminate an institution s deposit insurance if  among other things  the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations 
it is the policy of the fdic to deem an insured institution to be in an unsafe or unsound condition if its ratio of tier capital to total assets is less than 
tier capital is similar to core capital but includes certain investments in and extensions of credit to subsidiaries engaged in activities not permitted for national banks 
regulation of fidelity affiliates affiliate and insider transactions 
the ability of bank plus and its non depository subsidiaries to deal with fidelity is limited by the affiliate transaction rules  including sections a and b of the federal reserve act  which also govern bif insured banks 
with very limited exceptions  these rules require that all transactions between fidelity and an affiliate must be on arms length terms 
the term affiliate covers any company that controls or is under common control with fidelity  but does not include individuals and generally does not include fidelity s subsidiaries 
under section a and section of the hola  specific restrictions apply to transactions in which fidelity provides funding to its affiliates fidelity may not purchase the securities of an affiliate  make a loan to any affiliate that is engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company  or acquire from an affiliate any asset that has been classified  a nonaccrual loan  a restructured loan  or a loan that is more than days past due 
as to affiliates engaged in bank holding company permissible activities  the aggregate of a loans  guarantees  and letters of credit provided by the savings bank for the benefit of any one affiliate and b purchases of assets by the savings bank from the affiliate  may not exceed of the savings bank s capital stock and surplus for the aggregate of permissible transactions with all affiliates 
all loans to affiliates must be secured by collateral ranging from to of the amount of the loan  depending on the type of collateral 
in addition  ots regulations on affiliate transactions require  among other things  that savings institutions retain records of their affiliate transactions that reflect such transactions in reasonable detail 
if a savings institution has been the subject of a change of control application or notice within the preceding two year period  does not meet its minimum capital requirements  has entered into a supervisory agreement  is subject to a formal enforcement proceeding  or is determined by the ots to be the subject of supervisory concern  the institution may be required to provide the ots with days prior notice of any affiliate transaction 
under ots regulatory limitations  loans by fidelity to directors  executive officers and stockholders of fidelity  bank plus  and bank plus subsidiaries collectively  insiders  or to a corporation or partnership that is at least owned by an insider a related interest are subject to limits separate from the affiliate transaction rules 
however  a company that controls a savings institution is excluded from the coverage of the insider lending rules even if it owns or more of the stock of the institution  and is subject only to the affiliate transaction rules 
all loans to insiders and their related interests must be underwritten and made on non preferential terms  loans in excess of  must be approved in advance by fidelity s board of directors  and fidelity s total of such loans may not exceed of fidelity s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
loans by fidelity to its executive officers are subject to additional limits which are even more stringent 
in addition to these regulatory limitations  fidelity has adopted a policy which requires prior approval of its board of directors for any loans to insiders or their related interests 
enforcement 
whenever the ots has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation by a savings and loan holding company of any activity or of ownership or control of any non fdic insured subsidiary constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness  or stability of a savings and loan holding company s subsidiary savings institution and is inconsistent with the sound operation of the savings institution  the ots may order the holding company  after notice and opportunity for a hearing  to terminate such activities or to divest such noninsured subsidiary 
firrea also empowers the ots  in such a situation  to issue a directive without any notice or opportunity for a hearing  which directive may a limit the payment of dividends by the savings institution  b limit transactions between the savings institution and its holding company or its affiliates and c limit any activity of the association that creates a serious risk that the liabilities of the holding company and its affiliates may be imposed on the savings institution 
in addition  firrea includes savings and loan holding companies within the category of person designated as institution affiliated parties 
an institution affiliated party may be subject to significant penalties and or loss of voting rights in the event such party took any action for or toward causing  bringing about  participating in  counseling  or aiding and abetting a violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice by a savings institution 
community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act cra requires each savings institution  as well as other lenders  to identify and delineate the communities served through and by the institution s offices and to affirmatively meet the credit needs of its delineated communities and to market the types of credit the institution is prepared to extend within such communities 
the cra also requires the ots to assess the performance of the institution in meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such assessment into consideration in reviewing applications for mergers  acquisitions  and other transactions 
an unsatisfactory cra rating may be the basis for denying such an application 
performance is assessed on the basis of an institution s actual lending  service and investment performance rather than the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the ots assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs improvement or substantial noncompliance 
based on its most recent examination  fidelity was rated satisfactory 
federal home loan bank system the federal home loan banks provide a credit facility for member institutions 
as a member of the fhlb of san francisco  fidelity is required to own capital stock in the fhlb of san francisco in an amount at least equal to the greater of of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid home loans  home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the end of each calendar year  assuming for such purposes that at least of its assets were home mortgage loans  or of its advances from the fhlb of san francisco 
at december   fidelity was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in the stock of the fhlb of san francisco of million 
long term fhlb advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance and all fhlb advances must be secured by specific types of collateral 
federal reserve system the frb requires savings institutions to maintain noninterest earning reserves against certain of their transaction accounts primarily deposit accounts that may be accessed by writing unlimited checks and non personal time deposits 
for the calculation period at december   fidelity was required to maintain million in noninterest earning reserves and was in compliance with this requirement 
the balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the frb may be used to satisfy fidelity s liquidity requirements discussed above 
as a creditor and a financial institution  fidelity is subject to certain regulations promulgated by the frb  including  without limitation  regulation b equal credit opportunity act  regulation d reserves  regulation e electronic funds transfers act  regulation f limits on exposure to any one correspondent depository institution  regulation z truth in lending act  regulation cc expedited funds availability act  and regulation dd truth in savings act 
as creditors of loans secured by real property and as owners of real property  financial institutions  including fidelity  may be subject to potential liability under various statutes and regulations applicable to property owners  generally including statutes and regulations relating to the environmental condition of the property 
see non banking regulation 
non banking regulation under various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances on  under or in such property 
in addition  any person or entity who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at the disposal or treatment facility 
such laws and regulations often impose liability regardless of fault and liability has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
pursuant to these laws and regulations  under certain circumstances  a lender may become liable for the environmental liabilities in connection with its borrowers properties  if  among other things  it either forecloses or participates in the management of its borrowers operations or hazardous substance handling or disposal practices 
although the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla and certain state counterparts provide exemptions for secured lenders  the scope of such exemptions is limited and a rule issued by the environmental protection agency clarifying such exemption under cercla has recently been held invalid 
in addition  cercla and certain state counterparts impose a statutory lien  which may be prior to a bank s interest securing a loan  for certain costs incurred in connection with removal or remediation of hazardous substances 
other laws and regulations may also require the removal or remediation of hazardous substances located on a property before such property may be sold or transferred 
it is the bank s current policy to identify and review certain environmental issues pertaining to its borrowers and the properties securing the loans of its borrowers prior to making any loan and foreclosing on any multifamily property 
if such review reveals any environmental issues  a phase i environmental audit which generally involves a physical inspection without any sampling and under certain circumstances  a phase ii environmental audit which generally involves sampling may be conducted by an independent environmental consultant 
it is also the bank s current policy with respect to loans secured by residential property with five or more units to automatically conduct a phase i environmental audit prior to foreclosing on such property 
under certain circumstances  the bank may decide not to foreclose on a property 
there can be no assurances that such review  phase i environmental audits or phase ii environmental audits have identified or will identify all potential environmental liabilities that may exist with respect to a foreclosed property or a property securing any loan or that historical  current or future uses of such property or surrounding properties will not result in the imposition of environmental liability on the bank 
the bank is aware that certain current or former properties on which it has foreclosed and properties securing its loans contain contamination or hazardous substances  including asbestos and lead paint 
under certain circumstances  the bank may be required to remove or remediate such contamination or hazardous substances 
although the bank is not aware of any environmental liability relating to these properties that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations  there can be no assurances that the costs of any required removal or remediation would not be material or substantially exceed the value of affected properties or the loans secured by the properties or that the bank s ability to sell any foreclosed property would not be adversely affected

item legal proceedings the bank s previously reported litigation with adc entitled american direct credit  llc  a nevada limited liability company  plaintiff v 
fidelity federal bank  a federal savings bank  defendant  in the united states district court  for the district of idaho  civil case no 
blw was settled as of october  by providing for an orderly termination of the contract between the bank and adc 
all documents necessary to effect this settlement between the bank and adc have been executed by the parties and a dismissal with prejudice of adc s case was entered by the court on march  under the settlement  adc was permitted a limited right for a litmited time to originate further credit card accounts  subject to more stringent credit underwriting standards  after which no further credit cards would be issued 
the settlement agreement further provided that adc could purchase the existing credit card portfolio through march  based upon a specified formula price 
until march   adc would provide certain collection services 
by march  all continuing relationships with adc will be terminated  except for certain defined obligations to indemnify against third party claims 
to date adc has not presented a purchase offer for the portfolio 
included in adc s indemnification undertakings is its obligation to provide a defense to the bank and bank plus in a series of consumer lawsuits pending in the state of alabama  including two purported class actions  and to indemnify the bank and bank plus for any adverse judgment flowing from the same 
the plaintiffs in the alabama litigation allege  generally  that misrepresentations were made to them in connection with their purchases of various appliances and other consumer items  including misrepresentations with respect to the nature and cost of financing the same through credit cards issued by the bank 
the bank believes that it has substantial legal defenses to these claims inasmuch as it did not control  direct or otherwise have any dealings with the sales people who supposedly made such misrepresentations 
while adc is currently performing upon its contractual obligations to provide a defense to the bank in this litigation  uncertainty exists as to its financial ability to continue to do so through the course of the alabama litigation and to perform upon its indemnification obligations  if needed  in light of the termination of the agreement between the bank and adc and adc s apparent inability to date to enter into a similar agreement with another financial institution 
in november  the bank entered into a credit card marketing relationship with mmg 
mmg was to solicit members of certain agreed upon affinity groups to become credit card holders 
the bank was to provide servicing and other related functions 
mmg and the bank were to share equally in program profits and losses 
in late summer of  disputes arose between the parties 
the bank asserted that mmg had improperly induced it to enter into the contract relationship by material misrepresentation to market to that group 
the bank further asserted that mmg had breached its contract by  among other things  engaging in regulatory violations and by engaging in conduct which violated certain rules pertaining to mastercard issuance 
on september  the bank instituted an arbitration proceeding in los angeles based upon such claims  entitled in the matter of arbitration between fidelity federal bank and mmg direct  inc  american arbitration association no 
 and in october the bank reasserted mmg s defaults and terminated the mmg contract 
thereafter  mmg filed an original petition and request for injunctive relief in the county court at law no 
 dallas county  texas entitled mmg direct  inc  plaintiff v 
fidelity federal bank  fsb  defendant  case no 
e the mmg direct  inc 
case 
this lawsuit purports to state a number of claims  including fraud in the inducement  breach of contract  common law fraud  negligent misrepresentation  accounting and constructive trust and seeks injunctive relief and damages based upon various asserted misrepresentations and omissions and failures to perform and breaches of contract attributed to the bank 
the bank removed this case to the united states district court and filed a motion to dismiss 
recently  following certain discovery requested by mmg  the bank renewed its motion to dismiss and filed  in the alternative  a motion to stay 
briefing has not yet been concluded and the court has not ruled on the bank s renewed motion to dismiss or alternate motion to stay 
thereafter  mmg filed a third party claim against the bank in a case brought by one of its purported creditors 
that suit is entitled tim mccarthy advertising  inc  plaintiff v 
mmg direct  inc  defendant  mmg direct  inc 
third party plaintiff v 
fidelity federal bank  fsb  third party defendant  no 
e in the county court at law no 
 dallas county  texas the mccarthy case 
in this lawsuit mmg asserted that the bank was obligated to indemnify mmg against mccarthy s claims under partnership and other theories 
the bank moved to stay mmg s third party complaint pending arbitration 
the court granted the bank s stay motion 
mmg moved for reconsideration and its motion was denied by the court on march  in light of mmg s attempts to avoid arbitration  and to instead litigate in the texas courts  the bank filed a petition to compel arbitration and an accompanying motion to compel arbitration 
the petition and motion were filed in the united states district court  central district of california  western division  case no 
tjh shx  under the caption fidelity federal bank  fsb  a california federal savings bank  plaintiff v 
mmg direct  inc  a delaware corporation  defendant the fidelity federal case 
mmg opposed and filed a motion to dismiss 
on march  the court denied mmg s motion to dismiss and granted the bank s motion to compel arbitration 
on march  mmg filed a third party petition against the bank filed in the district court  th judicial district  dallas county  texas  cause no 
dv  entitled revelation corporation of america  plaintiff v 
mmg direct  inc  defendant and third party plaintiff v 
fidelity federal bank  fsb  third party defendant the revelation case 
the allegations in mmg s third party petition in this action mirror many of the allegations and claims in the mmg direct  inc 
case  although several of those allegations have been modified and expanded 
the bank has recently amended its original arbitration petition to update and more comprehensively state its claims against mmg 
the bank believes that mmg s attempts to avoid arbitration are lacking in merit  because those attempts have been rejected in the mccarthy case via both the granting by the court of the bank s motion to stay and the denial by the court of mmg s motion for reconsideration and in the fidelity federal case through the denial of mmg s motion to dismiss and the granting of the bank s motion to compel arbitration 
the bank believes that the actions of these two courts should be helpful to the bank in persuading the court in the mmg direct  inc 
case and the revelation case that mmg is obligated to arbitrate any claims against the bank in los angeles  california and may not escape its obligation to do so 
the bank intends to vigorously pursue its claims against mmg and further believes that the claims asserted by mmg against the bank in the texas litigations and any further such claims as mmg may assert in any forum  including arbitration  are without merit 
the bank s contract claims against mmg currently exceed million and are expected to increase with the passage of time 
the company believes that all of the litigation instituted in the texas courts by mmg violates mmg s obligation to arbitrate 
on march   an action  case no 
bc  was filed against the bank in the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles 
the case is entitled choice one finance corp  plaintiff  v 
fidelity federal bank  fsb  and does through inclusive  defendants 
this action alleges that the bank breached its contract with the plaintiff and negligently interfered with contracts that the plaintiff had entered into with third parties 
in addition the complaint has a claim for negligent misrepresentation 
the complaint has not yet been served on the bank 
the bank disputes the claims set forth in the complaint 
the bank intends to defend vigorously the asserted claims

the amended complaint purports to expand the class period to extend from march  through september  the complaint includes claims for negligent misrepresentation  common law fraud  statutory fraud and violations of the california corporations code 
the complaint has not yet been served on the company 
it is the company s view that certain of the claims asserted in the complaint are legally deficient and that none of the claims asserted by the plaintiff are well grounded factually 
the company believes that the claims are meritless and intends to vigorously defend itself 
the bank was named a defendant in several individual and class actions brought by several borrowers which raise claims with respect to the manner in which the bank serviced certain adjustable rate mortgages which were originated during the period through six actions were filed between july and february  one in federal district court and five in california superior court 
in the federal case the bank won a summary judgment in the district court 
this judgment was appealed and the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed in part  reversed in part and remanded back to the district court for further proceedings 
the district court has ruled in favor of certifying a class in that action 
three of the california superior court cases resulted in final judgments in favor of the bank  after the plaintiffs unsuccessfully appealed the trial court judgments in favor of the bank 
the other two cases have been dismissed 
the plaintiffs principal claim in these actions is that the bank selected an inappropriate review date to consult the index upon which the rate adjustment is based that was one or two months earlier than what was required under the notes 
in a declining interest rate environment  the lag effect of an earlier review date defers the benefit to the borrower of such decline  and the reverse would be true in a rising interest rate environment 
the bank strongly disputes these contentions and is vigorously defending the remaining suit 
the parties are in settlement negotiations but no assurances can be given regarding the outcome of such negotiations 
the legal responsibility and financial exposure with respect to foregoing claims presently cannot be reasonably ascertained and  accordingly  there is a risk that the outcome of one or more of these outstanding claims could result in the payment of amounts which could be material in relation to the financial condition or results of operations of the bank 
in the normal course of business  the company and certain of its subsidiaries have a number of other lawsuits and claims pending 
although there can be no assurance  the company s management and its counsel believe that none of these other lawsuits or claims will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or business of the company

results of operations summary the company reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   as compared to net earnings of million for the year ended december  during  the company recorded a provision for estimated loan losses of million and incurred operating expenses of million 
increasing delinquencies and charge offs in the credit card loan portfolio were the primary causes for the significant increase in the provision for estimated loan losses 
operating expenses  which increased million for the year as compared to the corresponding period  were higher primarily due to costs associated with the bank s credit card programs and other business initiatives 
for the year ended december   the company reported net earnings of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  during  the company incurred operating expenses of million  a million reduction from  and recorded million of income tax benefits 
the reduction in operating expenses primarily related to lower fdic insurance costs resulting from the special one time saif recapitalization payment of million in the third quarter of net interest income the following tables present the primary determinants of net interest income for the periods indicated 
for the purpose of this analysis  nonaccruing mortgage loans are included in the average balances  and delinquent interest on such loans has been deducted from interest income

   net interest income  interest rate spread    net yield on interest earning assets average npl balance included in average loan balance    net delinquent interest removed from interest income    reduction in net yield on interest earning assets due to delinquent interest 
net interest income is primarily affected by a the average volume and repricing characteristics of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  b the level and volatility of market interest rates  c the level of npls and d the interest rate spread between the yields earned and the rates paid 
the following tables present the dollar amount of changes in interest income and expense for each major component of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of change attributable to changes in average balances and average rates for the periods indicated 
because of numerous changes in both balances and rates  it is difficult to allocate precisely the effects thereof 
for purposes of these tables  the change due to volume is initially calculated as the change in average balance multiplied by the average rate during the prior period and the change due to rate is calculated as the change in average rate multiplied by the average volume during the prior period 
any change that remains unallocated after such calculations is allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rates

     the million increase in net interest income between the year ended december  and the year ended december  reflects the increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  offset by a decrease in the net yield to from 
the increases in the average balances of interest earning assets are due to increases in credit card loans and increases in mbs and the short term investment portfolios  which is in line with the company s prior plans to leverage excess capital 
the net yield decreased due to the use of higher costing cds and fhlb advances to fund the increase in interest earning assets  higher prepayments on the mbs portfolio causing increased amortization of the purchase premiums and the amortization of losses incurred in the second quarter of on the hedging program for fixed rate mbs 
these were partially offset by a lower average balance of npls and an increase in the average balance of higher yielding credit card loans 
the million decrease in net interest income between and was primarily due to decreased rates on average interest earning assets combined with an increase in the average balance of higher cost of fhlb advances 
this was partially offset by an increase in the level of interest earning assets and a reduction in the cost of cds 
the company s net interest income  interest rate margin and operating results have been negatively affected by the level of loans on nonaccrual status 
gross balances of npls averaged million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as a result  the company s net interest rate margin was decreased by   and in those years  respectively 
provision for estimated loan losses the increase in provisions for estimated loan losses of million for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  was primarily due to increasing delinquencies and charge offs in a rapidly growing sub prime credit card portfolio 
gross credit card balances were million as compared to million  and delinquencies were as compared to at december  and december   respectively 
credit card charge offs were million in  including million of loans purchased by marketers of the credit enhancement credit card programs  with no comparable amounts in the decrease in provisions for estimated loan losses of million for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  was primarily due to decreased mortgage loan delinquencies and lower npas 
while the bank believes that the actions it has taken to significantly reduce credit card originations will reduce future credit losses in the credit card portfolio  no assurances can be given that these actions will have that result 
in addition  a number of other factors could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the credit card programs and the company s overall financial performance 
these factors include a national or regional economic slowdown or recession which increases the risk of defaults and credit losses  an increase in the number of customers seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws which increases the amount of charge offs  the effects of fraud by third parties or customers  the effectiveness of the company s collection efforts  and the financial performance of the bank s remaining credit card marketers  which may impact their ability to fulfill their contractual financial obligations which may result in increased losses to the bank

of the marketing fees paid to mmg during  the bank was entitled to reimbursement of million related to the cancellation of previously opened credit card accounts 
however  due to the uncertainty regarding the collectibility of these amounts  the bank wrote off the million against credit card fee income 
in substantially all credit card fees were passed through to the credit card marketers under the credit enhancement programs 
the loss on securities was million in as compared to million for the activity included a loss of million related to a hedging program for the fixed rate mbs portfolio 
during  the company used futures on treasury notes to hedge the valuation fluctuations of its fixed rate mbs portfolio 
based on historical performance  futures on treasury notes provided an expectation of high correlation with the mbs 
based on the correlation analysis completed for the period ended june   it was determined that high correlation in the fluctuations of the fair values of the mbs and the hedge instruments had not occurred 
as a result  the million loss was recorded  which represented the extent to which the futures results had not been offset by the effects of price changes on the mbs 
the million loss was offset by gains on the sale of securities and recoveries related to past loan securitizations 
other components of the increase in noninterest income in from include a an increase in atm cash services income of million  which is due to higher cash balances outstanding for the period based on a higher number of atms serviced  b decreased real estate operations costs of million primarily due to improved execution of reo sales and a lower volume of foreclosed properties  and c an increase in investment products and loan fee income of million due to a higher volume of sales of investment and loan products for the year  million of which were related to the calpers program 
these favorable variances were offset by million in prepayment expenses on the early repayment of fhlb advances related to the bank s efforts to reduce assets for regulatory capital purposes 
noninterest income increased by million from million in to million in the major component of this increase are a fee income from sale of uninsured investment products increased by million as a result of increased sales  b fee income on deposits and other income increased by million primarily as a result of a higher average volume of deposit balances in as compared to  c net gains on securities activities in increased by million from primarily due to increased sales  d fee income on americash increased million as a result of cash services fees received in  with no comparable amounts in and e decreased real estate operations of million primarily due to improved execution on sales of foreclosed properties 
these favorable variances were partially offset by the writedown of securities of million

servicing of the bank s credit card programs  which is performed by third party servicers and bpcs  increased million in as compared to this increase was due to the significant increase in the bank s credit card portfolio in and the increasing delinquencies and charge offs in the credit card portfolio 
one of the most significant costs in servicing credit card accounts is the collection efforts expended on delinquent accounts 
several business initiatives were started late in or early  which contributed to the increase in operating expenses in the calpers  moa  internet bank and other projects contributed million to the increase in operating expenses for in addition  the year compliance project activities and represented million of the million increase in in professional services expense 
increases in personnel and benefits  occupancy and office related expenses were due to acquisitions  in the third quarter of  of hancock savings bank  fsb hancock  a five branch savings association  and one branch from coast federal bank  fsb coast 
increased expenses related to such acquisitions totaled million 
the company has taken steps to reduce operating expenses in  including a reduction in staffing  which  along with executive management changes  resulted in million in severance expense in although the company is currently taking steps to reduce operating expenses  most of these reductions will not be fully effective until sometime in and these reductions will be offset by higher fdic insurance rates  litigation costs and increased regulatory costs 
operating expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million including the saif special assessment of million for the year ended december  the change was primarily due to a a decrease of million of fdic insurance costs resulting from the special one time recapitalization payment of million to the saif in the third quarter of and an upgrade in the bank s assessment classification  b a decrease of million in other expenses primarily due to lower legal settlement costs related to certain litigation 
these favorable variances were partially offset by a a million increase in personnel and benefit expense due to a increase of in ftes during primarily due to the hancock acquisition and the start up of new business initiatives  b an increase of million in occupancy costs primarily due to hancock and coast branch acquisitions 
income taxes for federal income tax purposes  the maximum rate of tax applicable to savings institutions is currently for taxable income over million 
for california franchise tax purposes  savings institutions are taxed as financial corporations at a higher rate than that applicable to nonfinancial corporations because of exemptions from certain state and local taxes 
the california franchise tax rate applicable to financial corporations is approximately 
the company s expected combined federal and state statutory tax rate is approximately of earnings before income taxes 
for  the company s actual effective income tax rate was an expense of on losses before income taxes

 accounting for income taxes  limitations on the recognition of the deferred tax asset attributable to the current period book losses 
the effective tax benefit rate of on earnings before income taxes for reflects the federal and state tax benefit attributable to the utilization of net operating loss nol carryforwards and the partial recognition of the deferred tax asset based on anticipated future operations 
under sfas no 
 the recognition of a net deferred tax asset is dependent upon a more likely than not expectation of realization of the deferred tax asset  based upon the analysis of available evidence 
a valuation allowance is required to sufficiently reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
as of december   the company reflected a net deferred tax asset of million 
after consideration of the company s recent earnings history and other available evidence  management of the company determined that under the criteria of sfas no 
it was appropriate to reduce the allowable net deferred tax asset to million as of december  the analysis of available evidence is performed each quarter utilizing the more likely than not criteria required by sfas no 
to determine the amount  if any  of the deferred tax asset to be realized 
adjustments to the valuation allowance are made accordingly 
there can be no assurance that the company will recognize additional portions of the deferred tax asset in future periods 
furthermore  the criteria of sfas no 
could require the recording of additional valuation allowances against the million net deferred tax asset through the recording of tax expense in future periods

the performance of the company s loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties has been affected by southern california economic conditions 
these portfolios are particularly susceptible to the potential for declines in the southern california economy  such as increasing vacancy rates  declining rents  increasing interest rates  declining debt coverage ratios  and declining market values for multifamily and commercial properties 
in addition  the possibility that investors may abandon properties or seek bankruptcy protection with respect to properties experiencing negative cash flow  particularly where such properties are not cross collateralized by other performing assets  can also adversely affect the multifamily loan portfolio 
during  the company significantly increased its primarily sub prime credit card portfolio 
during the third quarter of  the bank experienced increases in delinquencies and charge offs in excess of prior expectations 
the performance of the bank s credit card portfolio may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including a national or regional economic slowdown or recession  an increase in the number of customers seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws  the effectiveness of the company s collection efforts  and fraud by third parties or customers 
in addition  because the portfolio is primarily sub prime  the bank may experience significantly higher delinquencies and charge offs than those experienced by other credit card issuers whose portfolios are not sub prime

these accounting standards prescribe the measurement methods  income recognition and disclosures concerning impaired loans 
the sva is established where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a specific loan that management believes indicate the probability that a loss has been incurred 
the alll is established to provide for credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio other than those provided for in svas 
the alll is computed utilizing several models and methodologies which are based upon a number of factors  including historical delinquency and loss experience  the level of nonperforming and internally classified loans  the composition of the loan portfolio  estimated remaining lives of the various types of loans within the portfolio  prevailing and forecasted economic conditions and management s judgment 
for small dollar value homogeneous loans such as consumer installment loans  residential mortgages and credit card loans  the company utilizes computations based on various factors  including past loss experience  recent economic events and current conditions and portfolio delinquency rates 
for loans or groups of loans for which the company has little or no loss experience of its own  the company utilizes the loss experience for similar types of loans of other enterprises 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the alll consists of o a calculated component  and o a judgmental component the calculated component of the alll at december  was determined as follows o single family mortgage loans a delinquency migration model was utilized which applies delinquency and loss factors to the outstanding portfolio segregated by delinquency status 
the delinquency and loss factors are based on delinquency migration results of the company s single family loan portfolio for the most recent twelve months  or  in the case of nonconforming mortgage loans  are based on the delinquency and loss experience for similar types of loans of other enterprises 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o multifamily mortgage loans graded pass or special mention loss factors were applied to outstanding loan balances based on the internal risk grade of those loans or pools of loans 
these loss factors are based on classification migration models that track three years of the company s historical loss experience 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o commercial industrial real estate loans graded pass or special mention loss factors were applied to outstanding loan balances based on the internal risk grade of those loans or pools of loans 
these loss factors are based on loss experiences for similar types of loans of other enterprises 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o multifamily and commercial industrial real estate loans graded substandard for all loans greater than million  an estimated allowance was computed based on the estimated value of the underlying collateral of each loan net of estimated selling and disposition costs 
for all other loans  loss factors were applied to the outstanding loan balances based on their relative size or loan to value ratio 
the loss factors utilized were based in part on the company s historical experience and current expectations 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o credit card loans originated under the adc and mmg agreements the company utilized a delinquency migration model that applies delinquency migration factors to the outstanding portfolio segregated by delinquency status 
the delinquency migration model assumes the continuation of historical delinquency patterns from current accounts to charge off 
no recovery of charged off accounts was assumed 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o credit card loans originated under other programs delinquency migration models based on the related credit card portfolios specific experience were utilized or  for the most recently established programs  loss factors based in part on the company s loss experience for its other credit card portfolios were applied 
estimated charge offs in  net of related cash deposits and guarantees of credit enhanced credit card program marketers  are expected to be million 
o auto loans a delinquency migration model  which applies delinquency and loss factors to the outstanding portfolio segregated by delinquency status  was utilized 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
o all other loans loss factors were applied to the outstanding loan balances 
these loss factors were based on the company s historical experience or the loss experience for similar types of loans of other enterprises 
estimated charge offs in are expected to be million 
loans with svas are excluded from the computation of alll 
the judgmental component is based upon management s evaluation of various conditions  the effects of which are not directly measured in determining sva or the calculated component 
the evaluation of the inherent loss regarding these conditions involves a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the judgmental component include the following conditions o level of inherent uncertainty in the precision of the calculated component  o general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  o credit quality trends  including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  o recent trends in collateral values  o loan volumes and concentrations  o seasoning of the loan portfolios  o specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  o recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  o duration of the current business cycle  and o bank regulatory examination results executive management reviews these conditions quarterly 
if any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of this condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to this credit 
where any of these conditions are not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit as of the evaluation date  management s evaluation of the probable loss concerning this condition is reflected in the judgmental component 
the credit enhanced credit card programs require the marketing agent  as part of their contractual obligation to reimburse fidelity for credit losses  to maintain cash deposits with fidelity 
these cash deposits are deducted from the computed amount of estimated future credit losses in determining the required levels of alll and are considered part of the reserves available to cover future credit losses 
in addition  the bank does not provide for estimated credit losses in excess of cash deposits for the credit enhanced credit card programs if a determination is made that the bank can rely on the marketer for payment of future credit losses 
the company s allowance for credit losses is based upon estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount actually observed for these losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company s methodology includes several features that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses 
the migration models that are used are designed to be self correcting by taking into account the company s recent delinquency and loss experience 
pooled loan loss factors are adjusted quarterly based upon the level of net charge offs expected by management in the next twelve months 
furthermore  the company s methodology permits adjustments to any loss factor used in the computation of the formula allowance in the event that  in management s judgment  significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date are not reflected in the loss factors 
by assessing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  the company is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon any more recent information that has become available 
the company believes its policies and procedures for establishing the allowance for credit losses and for providing provisions for estimated loan losses are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  including sfas no 
 sfas no 
 sfas no 
and regulatory standards established by the ots 
the allowance for loan losses does not represent the amount of losses that could be incurred under adverse conditions that management does not consider to be the most likely to arise 
in addition  management s classification of assets and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is an ongoing process 
consequently  there can be no assurance that material additions to the bank s allowance for loan losses will not be required in the future  thereby adversely affecting earnings and the bank s ability to maintain or build capital

customer deposits are insured by the fdic to the maximum amount permitted by law up to  per account 
the company has several types of deposit accounts designed to attract both short term and long term deposits 
at december   the company had deposits of billion 
the following table presents the distribution of deposit accounts at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands passbook accounts   checking accounts   money market savings accounts   total transaction accounts   cds   total deposits   there were no brokered deposits outstanding at december  and the following table summarizes cds by remaining maturity and weighted average rate at december  remaining term to maturity greater less than to to than months months months months total dollars in thousands cds less than       greater than       total cds      weighted average yield less than  greater than  total weighted average yield on cds the following table provides information with regards to the bank s most recent quarterly experience in the levels of and pricing of cds for the period indicated weighted average rate new or new or maturities renewed net change maturities renewed dollars in thousands cds maturing in quarter ended december     september     june     march     december     the distribution of certificate accounts by date of maturity is an important indicator of the relative stability of a major source of funds 
longer term certificate accounts generally provide greater stability as a source of funds  but currently entail greater interest costs than passbook accounts 
the following tables summarize certificate accounts by maturity  as a percentage of total deposits and weighted average rate at december  weighted percent of total average matures in quarter ended amount deposits rate dollars in thousands march   june   september   december   march   june   september   december  and after  total cds  borrowings the following table sets forth certain information as to the company s fhlb advances and other borrowings at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands fhlb advances fixed rate advances    floating rate advances   total fhlb advances    other borrowings senior notes   mortgage backed notes  commercial paper  total other borrowings    total borrowings    weighted average interest rate on all borrowings percent of total borrowings to total liabilities and stockholders equity undrawn sources the company maintains other sources of liquidity to draw upon  which at december  include a a line of credit with the fhlb with million available  b million in unpledged securities available to be placed in reverse repurchase agreements or sold and c million of unpledged loans  some of which would be available to collateralize additional fhlb or private borrowings  or be securitized 
contingent or potential uses of funds the bank had unfunded loans totaling less than million and million at december  and  respectively 
the bank had no unfunded loans at december  additionally  unused lines of credit related to credit card loans and other credit lines totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
liquidity the regulatory required average daily balance of liquid assets is of the liquidity base  which is based on a quarterly average 
the bank s quarterly average regulatory liquidity ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
the bank s monthly average regulatory liquidity ratio  under the liquidity regulations in force at the time was for december  holding company liquidity at december  and  bank plus had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
bank plus has no material potential cash producing operations or assets other than its investments in fidelity  gateway and bpcs 
accordingly  bank plus is substantially dependent on dividends from fidelity  gateway and bpcs in order to fund its cash needs  including its payment obligations on the million principal amount of the senior notes issued in exchange for fidelity s preferred stock 
bank plus has funded the interest payments on its senior notes through preferred stock and common stock dividends from fidelity 
the preferred stock carries a rate and is not subject to ots approval unless  among other things  the bank s regulatory capital falls below adequately capitalized 
the common stock dividends  which are used to fund the difference between the rate on the senior notes and the rate on the preferred stock dividends  are currently subject to ots approval 
no assurance can be given that the ots will approve the common stock dividends in the future  or that the ots will approve the preferred stock dividends in the future if the bank s regulatory capital falls below adequately capitalized 
the february senior note interest payments were funded by the preferred stock dividend from fidelity and cash on hand at bank plus 
in future periods  bank plus may be able to increase its liquidity through dividends from gateway or bpcs 
no assurance can be given that funds will continue to be available at bank plus to pay future interest payments  or that dividends will be able to be made by gateway or bpcs to provide additional liquidity 
commitments and contingencies fidelity enters into agreements to extend credit to customers on an ongoing basis 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
most commitments are expected to be drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts generally represent future cash requirements 
at december   the company had less than million in commitments to fund loans 
there was an unused line of credit of million associated with a mortgage warehouse credit agreement 
in addition  the company has extended lines of credit in the form of credit cards totaling million  of which million was unused and available at december  as of december   the company had certain mortgage loans with a gross principal balance of million  of which million had been sold in the form of mortgage pass through certificates  over various periods of time  to four investor financial institutions leaving a balance of million in loans retained by the company 
these mortgage pass through certificates provide a credit enhancement to the investors in the form of the company s subordination of its retained percentage interest to that of the investors 
in this regard  the aggregate of million held by investors are deemed senior mortgage pass through certificates and the million in loans held by the company are subordinated to the senior mortgage pass through certificates in the event of borrower default 
full recovery of the million is subject to this contingent liability due to its subordination 
in  the bank repurchased as an investment a portion of the mortgage pass through certificates  and at december   the balance of the repurchased certificate was million and was included in the mbs afs portfolio and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the other senior mortgage pass through certificates totaling million at december  are owned by other investor institutions 
the contingent liability for credit losses on these mortgage pass through certificates was million and million at december  and  respectively  and is included in other liabilities 
the company also effected the securitization by fnma of multifamily mortgages wherein whole loans were swapped for triple a rated mbs through fnma s alternative credit enhancement structure aces program 
these mbs were later sold and the current outstanding balance as of december  of million is serviced by the company  including commitments assumed as a result of the hancock acquisition 
as part of a credit enhancement to absorb losses relating to the aces transaction  the company has pledged and placed in a trust account  as of december   million  comprised of million in cash and million in us treasury securities and mbs 
the company shall absorb losses  if any  which may be incurred on the securitized multifamily loans to the extent of million 
fnma is responsible for any losses in excess of the million 
the corresponding contingent liability for credit losses was million and million at december  and  respectively  and is included in other liabilities 
asset liability management and market risk the objective of asset liability management is to maximize the net income of the company while controlling interest rate risk exposure 
banks and savings institutions are subject to interest rate risk when assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times duration risk  against different indices basis risk or for different terms yield curve risk 
the decision to control or accept interest rate risk can only be made with an understanding of the probability of various scenarios occurring 
having liabilities that reprice more quickly than assets is beneficial when interest rates fall  but may be detrimental when interest rates rise 
the following table sets out the maturity and rate sensitivity of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  gap  as reflected in the table  represents the estimated difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing during future periods as adjusted for interest rate swaps and other financial instruments as applicable  and based on certain assumptions  including those stated in the notes to the table 
maturity and rate sensitivity analysis as of december  maturity or repricing within over months months years years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash and cash equivalents   investment securities    mbs    loans receivable arms and other adjustables      fixed rate loans      total gross loans receivable       total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities deposits checking and savings accounts   money market accounts   fixed maturity deposits retail customers     wholesale customers   total deposits     borrowings fhlb advances   other   total borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities      repricing gap      gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets repricings shown are based on the contractual maturity or repricing frequency of the instrument 
investment securities include fhlb stock of million 
arms are primarily in the shorter categories as they are subject to interest rate adjustments 
these liabilities are subject to daily adjustments and are therefore included in the within months category 
the company manages interest rate risk by  among other things  maintaining a portfolio consisting primarily of adjustable rate mortgage arm loans 
arm loans comprised  and of the total mortgage loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
the percentage of monthly adjustable arms to total mortgage loans was approximately  and at december   and  respectively 
interest sensitive assets provide the company with a degree of long term protection from rising interest rates 
at december   approximately of fidelity s total mortgage loan portfolio consisted of loans which mature or reprice within one year  compared to approximately at both december  and fidelity has in recent periods been negatively impacted by the fact that increases in the interest rates accruing on fidelity s arms lagged the increases in interest rates accruing on its deposits due to reporting delays and contractual look back periods contained in the bank s loan documents 
at december   of the bank s mortgage loans  which are indexed to cofi  as with all cofi portfolios in the industry  do not reprice until some time after the industry liabilities composing cofi reprice 
the company s liabilities reprice generally in line with the cost of funds of institutions which comprise the fhlb eleventh district 
in the company s case  the lag between the repricing of its liabilities and its arm loans indexed to cofi is approximately four months 
thus  in a rising rate environment there will be upward pressure on rates paid on deposit accounts and wholesale borrowings  and the company s net interest income will be adversely affected until the majority of its interest earning assets fully reprice 
conversely  in a falling interest rate environment  net interest income will be positively affected 
analysis of the gap provides only a static view of the company s interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time 
the actual impact of interest rate movements on the company s net interest income may differ from that implied by any gap measurement 
the actual impact on net interest income may depend on the direction and magnitude of the interest rate movement  as well as competitive and market pressures 
the company may employ interest rate swaps  caps and floors in the management of interest rate risk 
an interest rate swap agreement is a financial transaction where two counterparties agree to exchange different streams of payments over time 
an interest rate swap involves no exchange of principal either at inception or upon maturity  rather  it involves the periodic exchange of interest payments arising from an underlying notional principal amount 
interest rate caps and floors generally involve the payment of a one time premium to a counterparty who  if interest rates rise or fall  above or below a predetermined level  will make payments to the company at an agreed upon rate for the term of the agreement until such time as interest rates fall below or rise above the cap or floor level 
by their nature all such instruments involve risk  and the maximum potential loss may exceed the value at which such instruments are carried 
as is customary for these types of instruments  the company usually does not require collateral or other security from other parties to these instruments 
the company manages its credit exposure to counterparties through credit approvals  credit limits and other monitoring procedures 
the company s credit policy committee makes recommendations regarding counterparties and credit limits which are subject to approval by the board of directors 
in  the bank entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to convert a fixed rate fhlb advance to a floating rate 
the swap was terminated in the fourth quarter of and as a result recorded a deferred gain of million that is being amortized as a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the fhlb advance 
there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  market risk the bank s asset liability committee alco  which includes senior management representatives  monitors and considers methods of managing the rate and sensitivity repricing characteristics of the balance sheet components consistent with maintaining acceptable levels of changes in net portfolio value npv and net interest income 
a primary purpose of the company s asset liability management is to manage interest rate risk to effectively invest the company s capital and to preserve the value created by its core business operations 
as such  certain management monitoring processes are designed to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on npv and net interest income 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the company s change in npv in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates and interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is used to measure the company s interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in npv of its cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
npv is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained one hundred to three hundred basis points increase or decrease in the market interest rates 
npv is calculated by the company pursuant to the guidelines established by the ots 
the calculation is based on the net present value of estimated discounted cash flows utilizing market prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker quotations and other public sources as of december   with adjustments made to reflect the shift in the treasury yield curve as appropriate 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposits decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the company s projected change in npv for the various rate shock levels at the dates indicated december  december  percentage change in percentage change in change in interest rates net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio in basis points income value income value base case the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents the npv of the bank in a stable interest rate environment versus the npv in the various rate scenarios 
the following table shows the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to change in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december  this data differs from that in the gap table as it does not incorporate the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
rather  it only reflects contractual maturities adjusted for anticipated prepayments

the company uses certain assumptions to estimate expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments and prepayments of principal 
the prepayment experience reflected herein is based on the company s historical experience 
the estimated fair values were computed as follows a investment and mbs securities were based on quoted market prices  b mortgage loans  mortgage servicing rights and all interest sensitive liabilities were based on an option adjusted cash flow valuation  which includes forward interest rate simulations  and c credit card loans are equal to the outstanding balances of the credit card loans less any applicable allowances for loan losses and deferred fees 
the credit card portfolio is relatively unseasoned and was generally marketed to customers with lower credit quality 
in addition  there exists a high level of uncertainty related to the future performance of the credit card portfolio because of the high levels of delinquencies and charge offs 
as a result  the company is not currently able to compute a fair value of the credit card portfolio  including any unused credit lines 
the fair values may not be indicative of the value derived upon a sale of all or part of the portfolios 
year the company utilizes computer software programs  systems and devices systems throughout the organization in order to support its on going operations 
if corrective action is not taken  many of these systems may not be able to correctly interpret and process dates into the company has inventoried and analyzed its systems to determine which will require modification  upgrade  or replacement 
the company has established a year project office to provide the business units with the support  guidance  and project management expertise to ensure that the company meets its year objectives 
the year project office is responsible for ensuring that the company complies with the guidelines established by the federal financial institutions examinations council ffiec 
the ffiec issues guidelines to provide further clarification on the federal regulatory requirements mandating how financial institutions prepare for the year in addition  the company has engaged an independent third party to provide project oversight and year subject matter expertise 
project s state of readiness the year project is comprised of two major phases 
phase i involves the installation of upgraded mission critical systems that are reported to be year complaint 
phase ii involves the testing of mission critical systems using future dates to certify the system as year compliant 
phase i of the project was completed in october with the upgrade of the company s deposit servicing systems to current release levels which are reported by the software vendor to be year compliant 
this milestone also included the conversion of the company s accounts payable and general ledger applications to new systems that the software vendor states are year compliant 
all systems upgraded during phase i have been successfully migrated into the company s production environment 
additionally  the company s mission critical embedded systems and mission critical applications that run on distributed platforms have been renovated and validated for year compliance 
the company initiated phase ii of this project in november phase ii is the testing and validating of the company s mission critical systems using future dates 
the company s internal testing strategy includes the thirteen future dates recommended by the ffiec plus additional dates that are believed to be important for certain applications 
the company has successfully tested a total of thirteen future dates 
nine of the future dates tested are included in the list of thirteen dates recommended by the ffiec 
during phase ii  the company has installed a number of program fixes to correct test exceptions identified during the first group of future date testing or to follow recommendations from the software vendor 
regression or re testing of these systems using future dates has begun to ensure that the identified test exceptions have been resolved 
future date testing of the company s internal mission critical systems will be completed by the end of the first quarter of with the exception of four non critical year dates  which are scheduled for completion early in the second quarter 
future date validation of the company s externally operated mission critical systems has begun and is scheduled to be completed by the end of the second quarter of the company implemented a year customer awareness plan to address year issues raised by customers 
as part of this plan  the company included a project status update in the december and january deposit account statements 
a risk management plan was developed to address risks posed by the company s material customers 
both of these plans were developed in accordance with the ffiec guidelines and are being reviewed and updated each quarter or as required 
estimated year project costs the total expense estimate for anticipated year project activities is million 
this forecast is based on information currently known about the company s systems and servicers as well as management s interpretation of the ffiec guidelines released to date 
a significant portion of this budget is allocated to the staffing of technology and support personnel to implement the required modifications and upgrades 
additional personnel are also required to perform the system testing  produce testing documentation  and prepare contingency plans required by the ffiec 
as of december   the company had incurred year related expenses of approximately million 
contingency plans the ffiec requires the development of remediation and business resumption contingency plans 
remediation contingency plans are initiated if the company fails to successfully complete renovation  validation  or implementation of a mission critical system 
business resumption plans are initiated if business interruptions should occur during the year event 
the contingency plans are designed to provide for the continuation of the company s critical business functions should such interruptions occur 
an overall year contingency plan strategy document has been developed and distributed to company business units 
the contingency plan was developed based on guidelines issued by the ffiec  the united states general accounting office and other sources 
company business units are in the process of creating detailed contingency plans 
the contingency planning process has been divided into the following five phases o contingency planning phase i phase i of the contingency planning process has been completed 
this phase required business units owners to identify critical business functions and to complete a risk assessment for the critical business functions 
o contingency planning phase ii phase ii of the contingency planning process has been completed 
in phase ii of the contingency planning process  the business units provided additional information  such as estimating the probability of a system failing  determining how long they could operate without certain functionality and a brief description of the work around that would be implemented if a system failed 
o contingency planning phase iii phase iii of the contingency planning process is almost complete 
this phase of the contingency planning process includes the identification of all of the documentation  resources  trigger dates  interfaces  and vendors required to finalize the contingency plan 
o contingency planning phase iv phase iv of the contingency planning process was initiated in january during this phase  a representative of the project office is meeting with each of the business units to review and finalize the documentation provided in phase iii 
the deliverable for phase iv is the written contingency plan containing details of the work around as well as departmental needs for seven identified disaster scenarios 
o contingency planning phase v after phase iv is completed  the company will begin phase v of the contingency planning process 
phase v consists of the testing and validation of the contingency plans and completion of an event plan for year end 
the fdic guidelines state that the bank must complete the organizational planning and business impact analysis contingency plans by march  the interagency statement established june  as the date by which the year contingency plans are to be substantially complete 
the company is currently on schedule to complete these plans within the specified time frames 
once the contingency plans have been completed and tested  the company will continue to review and update these plans on a regular basis to ensure they are consistent with the company s operations 
risk factors the company utilizes the systems and services of a number of third parties 
the failure of a key third party service provider could result in a material business interruption 
therefore  the company is monitoring the year progress of the company s third party vendors 
a third party vendor test plan has been developed to test mission critical services provided by third parties  where appropriate  for year compliance by june  additional expenses and delays may be incurred if future date testing or further analysis reveals test exceptions that require additional system renovations  system replacement  or the selection of another third party vendor 
unknown expenses and consequences could result if it becomes necessary to execute elements of the company s year contingency plans 
although the company has given the year project a high priority and management believes that year compliance will be achieved  there are no assurances that the company will be successful in addressing year issues within this estimated timeframe or budget 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  effective for financial statements for periods beginning after june  this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
it requires the company to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
this statement allows derivatives to be designated as hedges only if certain criteria are met  with the resulting gain or loss on the derivative either charged to income or reported as a part of other comprehensive income 
at this time  the company has not determined whether the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its operations and financial position 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage backed securities retained after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale by a mortgage banking enterprise  effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for certain mortgage banking activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for certain activities of mortgage banking enterprises and other enterprises that conduct operations that are substantially similar 
sfas no 
requires that after the securitization of mortgage loans held for sale  the resulting mbs and other retained interest should be classified in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  based on the company s ability and intent to sell or hold those investments 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its operations or financial position
