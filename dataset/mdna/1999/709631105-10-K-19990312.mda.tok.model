significant margin gains in most existing businesses were nearly offset by the lower operating margins of our recent acquisitions 
strategic investments were made throughout all the operating segments to position the company for continued productivity gains  increased capacity and improved customer service and satisfaction

the tax rate excluding the gain on the sale of federal was as compared to in net income increased to million versus million in eps of in represented an increase of over eps of 
eps without the gain from the sale of federal was  a percent increase over outlook pentair is focused on three core markets 
this diversification enables the company to consistently improve results despite difficult markets in one or another segment 
continuing demand for power tools and service equipment  ever rising needs for clean water throughout the world  and the critical importance of protecting sensitive electronics give pentair s chosen businesses excellent prospects for strong long term performance 
the company s basic operating strategies ongoing cost containment  new product development  multi channel distribution  and the pursuit of value added acquisitions drive the businesses in both growing and softer economies 
the pentair accelerating competitive excellence pace project is a corporate wide process redesign and cost savings program implemented in which management believes will improve operating efficiencies and therefore performance 
the company continues to look for synergistic acquisitions in each of its business segments  in line with its pattern over the past four years 
of the past twelve acquisitions  most were smaller businesses or product lines  which fit with existing operations  offering new products  or expanded geographic scope 
two  however  were stand alone strategic acquisitions of large established businesses  that helped create pentair s water and fluid technologies segment 
pentair intends to continue to pursue smaller  bolt on purchases  but will also carefully review larger targets  which have the capability to significantly expand its current segments  or in appropriate cases  to establish an additional business segment 
segment discussion pentair operates in three segments professional tools and equipment pte  water and fluid technologies wft  and electrical and electronic enclosures eee 
professional tools and equipment the pte segment includes delta international machinery  porter cable  lincoln automotive and century manufacturing 
products manufactured include woodworking machinery  portable power tools  battery charging and testing equipment  welding equipment  and lubricating and lifting equipment 
versus pte sales increased by million or 
these businesses continue to outperform their markets  upholding a performance record that includes three consecutive years of double digit sales growth and five consecutive years of double digit operating income growth 
the tool businesses continued to introduce innovative new products such as a plate joiner and jigsaw and expanded its offering of pneumatic nailers  staplers and accessories 
the service equipment business increased sales of booster pacs and expanded its automotive offering with the product line acquisition of t tech automatic transmission fluid exchangers 
operating income as a percent of sales increased to in from in profitability increased in the tool business due to favorable sourcing opportunities and volume efficiencies 
profitability also increased in the service equipment business due to productivity improvements and facility rationalizations 
versus pte sales increased by million or 
the full year effect of acquisitions contributed to less than half of the growth in sales 
substantial growth was achieved in the tool business due to the introduction of new products  increased brand awareness and continued expansion of the home center channel 
operating income as a percent of sales increased to in from in profitability improved across the entire segment due to volume efficiencies  cost control activities and continued productivity improvement 
outlook the professional tools and equipment segment is expected to perform well in with sales growth expected to continue to be in the double digits due to product line expansions and continued cross marketing through multiple channels of distribution 
profits should increase due to process improvements and additional rationalization activities 
water and fluid technologies the wft segment includes the pentair pump group  fleck controls and lincoln industrial 
products manufactured include pumps for wells and water treatment  sump pumps  valves for water softeners  and automated and manual lubrication systems and equipment 
versus wft sales increased by million or  primarily due to the full year effect of the pump business acquisitions  internal growth accounted for approximately of the sales increase 
net revenues were adversely impacted in part by the deliberate elimination in of the unprofitable sales from the layne bowler product line  acquired as part of the general signal pump acquisition in operating income as a percent of sales increased to in from in the group s performance benefited from improved performance at the water conditioning control valve business  increased profitability at european operations  and over million worth of manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies resulting from the integration of the acquired pump businesses 
versus wft sales increased by million or  primarily due to acquisitions 
in particular  results included months of operations from the pump businesses purchased from general signal 
otherwise  this segment experienced moderate growth  dampened by the effects of a stronger us dollar on the results of the european operations 
operating income as a percent of sales decreased to in from in acquisitions had lower margins than the overall percentage for this segment 
in addition  one plant experienced temporary production difficulties in meeting customer demand 
investments were made in across the segment addressing plant and product rationalization  process redesign  and production capacity 
profitability was also impacted by the weak european economy and the effects of a stronger us dollar 
outlook the wft segment intends in to expand its presence in global markets and broaden its product offerings 
volume efficiencies and productivity improvements are anticipated to continue to generate higher margins in core markets 
electrical and electronic enclosures the eee segment includes hoffman enclosures  schroff and the new pentair enclosures uk acquisition 
products manufactured include metallic and composite cases  subracks and cabinets that house and protect electrical and electronic controls  instruments  and components 
versus eee sales decreased million or 
enclosures americas sales were lower in largely due to lower automotive and machine tool capital spending 
enclosures europe sales also decreased due to slow sales of standard product throughout europe  while enclosures asia sales were below due to the weak asian economy 
with the october acquisition of pentair enclosures uk  pentair strengthened its position in markets serving high growth manufacturers in information and communication technology markets 
operating income as a percent of sales was flat at  the same overall profitability as  despite a decrease in sales 
enclosures americas increased profits due to overhead reductions and repositioning of the sales force to focus on high growth customers and leverage modification capabilities 
enclosures europe earnings declined in part due to lower volumes and unfavorable product mix throughout europe 
in addition  the closing of one facility in france and resultant headcount reductions were delayed by a lengthy government approval process until the fourth quarter of enclosures asia profitability decreased due to the weak asian economy 
versus eee sales increased by million or including a acquisition 
in addition  north american sales were the highest in history and outpaced the overall growth in the markets served 
the european operations  as measured in local currencies  also experienced year over year sales growth despite a continued weak economy in europe 
however  european sales excluding acquisitions  as measured in a stronger us dollar  were less than operating income as a percent of sales decreased to in from in this was due to the impact of the weak european economy  with intense competition affecting pricing and product mix of sales 
there were also strategic  one time costs related to the following implementation of a new world wide business system  start up of the new  square foot production facility in mt 
sterling  kentucky  integration of the transrack acquisition including reorganization of the french sales and marketing activities  the cost of employment reductions in europe  introduction of outdoor enclosures for the telecommunications market  and start up of the north american manufacture of a new flagship product  the proline enclosure 
outlook the eee segment holds a leading position in the global enclosures market and has excellent prospects for growth and profitability improvement as the business positions itself to continue leadership in standard product markets and expand offering of modified product 
the recent acquisition of pentair enclosures uk has increased the focus and ability to provide custom products and serve the fast growing telecom and datacom customers 
the eee segment is implementing a number of changes in its operations in order to control costs  improve productivity and respond more flexibly to its customers 
actions to be taken will likely include some facility rationalization and headcount reductions in and beyond 
liquidity and capital resources the company s free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures was million in  up from million in the company is targeting continued growth in free cash flow as a percent of sales through improved profitability and working capital ratios 
the company believes that cash flow from operations will continue to exceed its needs for capital programs  smaller acquisitions and dividends in the next year 
the company s financial position was strengthened in  even taking into account the three acquisitions made during the year 
as of december   the long term debt to total capital ratio was percent  compared to percent at the end of the company has sufficient financing capacity to continue its current acquisition program and to support its ongoing stock repurchase program 
the stock repurchase is intended to offset the dilution caused by stock issuances under employee stock compensation plans 
significant acquisitions above approximately million may require new or enlarged credit facilities 
the company believes these facilities would be available from various sources  if needed 
pentair invests capital to maintain existing businesses  implement productivity improvements  introduce new products and develop new businesses 
in the last five years  approximately million has been invested in pentair s businesses excluding acquisitions 
the company expects capital spending in to be in the million range 
contemplated uses include computer systems  cost reduction projects  new product development and reconfiguration of manufacturing facilities 
the company raised its anticipated quarterly dividend to cents per share to an indicated annual rate of 
per share 
this is a increase over pentair has increased its dividend payment each year since since the first cash dividend in  dividends have increased at an average annualized growth rate of 
inflation the impact of inflation on the company s results of operations is not considered material given the current inflationary outlook 
insurance subsidiary the company s captive insurance subsidiary provides a cost effective means of obtaining insurance coverage for general and product liability  product recall  workers compensation and auto liability 
the insurance subsidiary insures directly and reinsures an admitted carrier 
loss reserves are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate loss 
environmental matters under current laws and regulations  pentair s obligations relating to environmental matters are not expected to have a material impact on the company s operations  financial condition or operating results 
some subsidiaries face remediation of soil and groundwater as a result of predecessors or their own previous disposal practices 
in addition  pentair subsidiaries have been named as potentially responsible parties at a small number of superfund or other sites being studied or remediated 
generally  the affected business has been deemed to be a de minimis defendant or its share of remediation costs has not been material to pentair 
pentair contractually retained certain obligations pertaining to environmental issues of discontinued paper businesses and the divested sporting ammunition business 
costs and capital expenditures related to environmental obligations were not material to the company s operations in either or  and are not anticipated to be material in pentair engages environmental professionals to perform periodic audits of its facilities to assist pentair in complying with the various environmental laws and regulations faced by its businesses 
for purposes of maintaining appropriate reserves against liabilities associated with environmental issues  whether involving on or off site locations  pentair management reviews each individual site  taking into consideration the number of parties involved with the site  the joint and several liability imposed by certain environmental laws  the expected level of contributions of the other parties  the nature and quantities of wastes involved  the expected method and extent of remediation  the estimated professional expenses involved and the time period over which any costs would be incurred 
based on this evaluation  reserves are established when loss amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
insurance recoveries are recorded only when claims for recovery are settled 
year background the year issue is the result of computer programs and embedded computer chips originally having been designed and developed using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year 
any of the company s internal use computer programs and hardware as well as its products that are date sensitive may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions or engage in normal business activities for both the company and its customers who rely on its products 
state of readiness the company s businesses have had yk project programs in place since as long ago as to address year problems in critical business areas for information management systems  non information systems with embedded technology  suppliers and customers 
the company has largely completed its review and compliance planning for its critical information systems is 
certain of the company s larger businesses have completed the implementation of required actions for compliance  the balance of the business units are in the process of implementation 
in many cases  implementation includes installation of new enterprise resource planning erp systems designed to enable these businesses to operate more efficiently and to provide better management reporting 
pentair anticipates that implementation and testing phases will be substantially complete throughout the company by the third quarter of the company is also in the process of reviewing and replacing  where necessary  its other automated communications and manufacturing systems 
the company estimates that it will complete this phase by the second quarter of none of the company s products are believed to be date dependent 
the company has close working relationships with a large number of suppliers and customers 
these include  among others  utility and telecommunication providers  raw materials and components suppliers  and financial institutions  managed care organizations and large retail establishments 
the company has been reviewing  and continues to review  with its critical suppliers and major customers the status of their year readiness 
the company s business units have established plans for ongoing monitoring of suppliers during costs to address the year issue as a result of the numerous different is systems used by businesses that the company has acquired in recent years and also as a result of changing business requirements  the company has an ongoing development plan with scheduled replacements of hardware and software occurring in throughout the organization 
year compliance is a by product of our development plan 
the estimated cost associated with the total is development plan over the five year period from to is anticipated to be approximately million  which is approximately complete 
the estimated cost specifically attributable to year compliance  apart from other is development activities  amounts to approximately million  of which million had been spent through december  pentair has not deferred any significant is projects as a result of the implementation of the yk project 
risks represented by the year issue pentair believes that completed and planned modifications and conversions of its internal systems and equipment will allow it to be year compliant in a timely manner 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s systems or equipment  nor those of third parties on which pentair relies  will be year compliant  in all material respects  in a timely manner 
nor can pentair give any assurance that its own or third parties contingency plans will mitigate the effects of any noncompliance 
pentair believes that non compliance with year issues would likely result in some reduction of the company s operations for the first part of the year  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s businesses or their financial condition 
based on its assessments to date  pentair believes it will not experience any material disruption as a result of yk issues in internal manufacturing processes  information processing  interfacing with major customers or processing orders and billing 
however  if critical utility service providers experience difficulties  which affect pentair  or its business units  a shutdown of some or all operations at individual facilities could occur 
pentair is developing contingency plans to provide for continuity of processing in the event of a yk disruption which will be based on the outcome of its yk compliance reviews and the results of third party verification efforts 
assuming no major disruption in service from utility companies or similar critical third party providers  pentair believes that it will be able to manage its year transition without material effect on pentair s results of operations or financial condition 
the most reasonably likely worst case scenario of failure by pentair or its suppliers or customers to resolve year issues would be a temporary slowdown or cessation of manufacturing operations at one or more of pentair s facilities  and or a temporary inability on the part of pentair to timely process orders and to deliver finished products to customers 
delays in meeting customer orders would reduce or delay sales and affect the timing of billings to and payments received from customers and could result in complaints  charges or claims  or temporarily increasing working capital 
contingency plans pentair s businesses are in the process of developing year contingency plans  based on their review of their internal and external compliance progress 
a full review will be done following the end of the second quarter of to assess pentair s vulnerability to internal non compliance and potential third party failures and actions which can be taken to reduce unfavorable impacts 
possible plans may include arranging alternative or additional suppliers and service providers  increasing inventory levels  providing additional back up systems and replacing or upgrading equipment and software
