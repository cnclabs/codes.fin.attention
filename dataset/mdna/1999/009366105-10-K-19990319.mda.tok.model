item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the information set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements  which reflect the current view of the partnership with respect to future events and financial performance 
the words  expect  intend  believe  anticipate  likely and will and similar expressions generally identify forward looking statements 
these statements  including the ones discussing the year issue are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results  and events to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause the partnership s actual results to differ from current expectations include  among others  changes in the aircraft or aircraft leasing market  economic downturn in the airline industry  default by lessees under leases causing the partnership to incur uncontemplated expenses or not to receive rental income as and when expected  changes in interest rates and legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect the value of aircraft 
liquidity and capital resources the partnership presently has three long term debt facilities 
at december   the following amounts were outstanding million on a non recourse note collateralized by one aircraft leased to fedex  million on a non recourse note collateralized by one aircraft on lease to trans world airlines  and million on a long term variable rate revolving loan facility guaranteed by the partnership and collateralized by two aircraft on lease to usairways 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was outstanding under the partnership s loan facilities 
at december  approximately million remained available under the revolving loan facility 
in december  the partnership modified the fixed rate loan collateralized by the twa aircraft 
as a result of these modifications  the loan was paid down by million and the average life of the loan was reduced 
in addition  the interest rate on the remaining principal of million was reduced from to 
in december  the partnership expanded its variable rate revolving loan facility by million  million of which was used to prepay the twa debt mentioned above 
in addition  the interest rate on this loan facility was reduced slightly 
long term borrowings at december  represented of the original cost of the aircraft presently owned by the partnership  including capital expenditures for upgrades 
the terms of the partnership agreement permit debt to be at a level not exceeding of such cost 
total scheduled debt service principal and interest on the fixed loans in is million  and the principal payment on the floating loan in is projected to be million if no purchase or sale of aircraft  or any unforeseen business events occur 
debt service will be paid primarily from the rental payments received under aircraft leases 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  million for  and million for the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in and as compared with was due to reduced rentals as a result of a smaller portfolio 
in december  the partnership sold its interest in six aircraft  reducing rentals by million compared with the slight increase in reflects lower expenses as compared with total debt service on the fixed loans as a percentage of net cash provided by operating activities was   and for  and  respectively 
however  cash flow from operating activities does not fully reflect cash receipts from lease payments 
when the excess of rental receipts above finance lease income is added to cash flow from operating activities  the ratios become   and respectively 
the higher ratio as compared with primarily reflects the million early principal pay down of a fixed loan in the pay down was mainly financed by the variable line of credit 
the higher ratio as compared with the ratio is the result of the decrease in the net cash from operations due to a smaller portfolio  while the debt service principal and interest remained at about the same level 
cash distributions paid by the partnership were million per unit in  million per unit in  and million per unit in distributions paid in included a special cash distribution of cents per unit made from a portion of the sale proceeds received from the sale of a interest in one md aircraft 
distributions paid in included two special cash distributions 
the first  was a distribution of cents per unit made from the proceeds received from the december  sale of the partnership s interest in six aircraft  and the second was a distribution of cents per unit made from the proceeds received from the september  sale of the partnership s interest of one dc there were no special cash distributions paid in partnership net income was million in  million in  and million in the decline in net income from to largely reflects fewer gains on sale  whereas the decline from to primarily reflects the imposition of federal taxation at the partnership level 
pursuant to the limited partnership agreement  the partnership distributed all cash available from operations and also made special cash distributions  as described above 
since such distributions were in excess of earnings  partnership equity declined from million at december  to million at december   and limited partner equity per unit declined from to 
from a limited partner perspective  the portion of the distribution in excess of net income constitutes a return of capital 
total cash distributions declared since inception of the partnership have exceeded total net income by per unit 
results of operations in  revenues were earned from fifteen aircraft  seven of which were subject to finance leases us airways  twa  and fedex  and eight of were subject to operating leases continental  finnair  and sun jet 
the aircraft leased to finnair was sold in march on december   the operating lease with continental covering six aircraft expired  and the aircraft were sold on that date 
at year end  all of the partnership s lessees were current under their lease agreements and none was in bankruptcy 
the sales of the partnership s interests in aircraft on lease to finnair and continental produced gains of  and million  respectively 
vs 
in  revenues were earned from seven aircraft subject to finance leases us airways  twa  and fedex 
finance lease income increased from due to the partnership s purchase in january of an additional interest in the md aircraft on lease to twa 
in revenues were also earned from one aircraft subject to an operating lease sun jet 
sun jet filed for bankruptcy in june  and the year old aircraft was sold in september  at a gain of  as of december   the partnership no longer owned interests in any aircraft subject to operating leases 
at year end  all of the partnership s lessees were current under their lease agreements and none was in bankruptcy 
vs 
in  all revenues were earned from aircraft subject to finance leases 
the revenue reduction in as compared with is primarily due to the scheduled decline in finance lease income as the asset base declined 
in addition in  the partnership earned revenue from an aircraft on an operating lease and from a gain on sale of such aircraft 
no such revenues were earned in at year end  all the partnership s lessees were current under their lease agreements and none was in bankruptcy 
us airways  the partnership s major lessee of total year end assets reported profits of million on revenues of billion for  compared with profits of billion on revenues of billion for fedex of total year end assets reported profits of million on revenues of billion for fiscal year ended may   compared with profits of million on revenues of billion for twa of total year end assets  reported a net loss of million on revenues of billion for  compared with a net loss of million on revenues of billion for for information regarding the percentage of total partnership assets and revenues represented by aircraft owned and leased by the partnership  see business aircraft portfolio 
the partnership believes that its revenues and income have not been materially affected by inflation and changing prices because its principal items of revenue rental payments and a majority of its expenses interest are at fixed long term rates 
expenses before taxes in were million or million lower than the expenses of million 
in  the partnership incurred investor reporting expenses in connection with the solicitation of unitholder consents and depreciation expense related to the aircraft that was sold in september expenses in also included a provision for doubtful accounts 
no similar expenses were incurred in in january the partnership made an election to pay an annual tax at the partnership level of on its gross income beginning in in order to remain publicly traded 
as such  in the partnership recorded a tax provision of  pursuant to the newly imposed federal and state gross income tax 
year issue the year issue results from older computer programs using two  rather than four digits to define a year  thus the programs do not recognize a year that begins with rather than the familiar if not corrected  many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results 
since the partnership s operations consist primarily of collecting periodic lease payments on a limited number of leases and making periodic debt payments and distributions to its partners  the general partner believes that the partnership s exposure to the year problem is limited to the software programs and services it obtains from suppliers and vendors 
the partnership s leases and loans are supported by amortization schedules generated at the inception of these transactions  generally making the tracking of payments and recording of income and interest expense a manual process and thus independent of computer software 
the partnership relies on third parties external relationships such as banks  financial intermediaries  and tax services to facilitate certain business transactions 
the partnership has reviewed the impact of these external relationships on its business and concluded that the two most critical service providers are the provider of the tax service that generates the k tax statements to be used by our limited partners to complete their tax returns and the stock transfer agent that facilitates the public trading of the partnership s units 
in  the partnership contacted both vendors and has been advised their systems either are year compliant or will be compliant prior to december  the partnership believes that due to its minimal reliance on computer software to conduct its internal day to day transactions processing  the year projected costs are negligible 
however  the partnership is also dependent on third parties to fully conduct its business transactions as described above 
if these or other third parties fail to adequately resolve their year issues  the partnership could experience significantly increased administrative costs or delays in unit transfer or tax preparation functions 
the partnership anticipates that such costs would be incurred in locating alternative third party vendors which the partnership believes exist and transferring data to such alternative vendors 
the amount of such costs or potential delays is difficult to quantify 
the partnership will continue to monitor the progress of its third party vendors  relative to the year compliance  to attempt to ensure minimal disruptions to its operations 
the year compliance of each of the partnership s lessees is available from reports filed by the lessees with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the partnership s assets consist of aircraft subject to leases accounted for as financing leases  and thus consist of a future stream of fixed rental payments and a residual interest in the aircraft 
see note to financial statements for information as to finance lease receivables 
at december   the partnership had long term fixed rate notes payable of  and a revolving variable rate loan facility with  outstanding and approximately  of credit available 
see note to financial statements for information as to minimum future principal payments due and the interest rates applicable to the notes and revolving credit facility 
since the rental payments under its leases are fixed  but a portion of its liabilities are based on a variable interest rate  the assets and liabilities of the partnership are not perfectly hedged and the partnership bears some risk of interest rate fluctuations 
since a portion of its debt under the revolving credit facility is for variable working capital needs  the general partner believes that the risk of interest fluctuations is appropriate under the circumstances
