item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
general the company operates on a week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to june th 
this period is utilized because it closely coincides with the rice crop year in the southern united states and rice is the largest component of the company s business 
the company operates in various foreign countries and is therefore subject to currency fluctuations 
changes in the value of the united states dollar against these currencies will affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
when the united states dollar strengthens compared to other local currencies  the operating results of the company s foreign units translate into fewer united states dollars  thus decreasing the revenues and expenses of the company on a consolidated basis 
if the united states dollar weakens against the other relevant currencies  the opposite occurs 
the company s foreign units attempt to minimize the effects of currency risk by borrowing externally in the local currency and by hedging their purchases made in foreign currencies when that option is available 
as a matter of policy  the company does not engage in currency speculation 
changes in exchange rates historically have not materially impacted the company s net sales  costs or business practices and management expects this to continue 
inflationary conditions in the united states and europe have been moderate and have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for the three years ended june  despite higher inflationary rates in central america  inflation has not had a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company s units located in that region because the company has generally been able to pass on cost increases to its customers

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company utilizes derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in rice costs  packaging material costs and exchange rates related to inventory purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
these instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  accordingly  gains and losses on these instruments are deferred and included in the basis of the inventory hedged 
the company utilizes rough rice futures contracts  packaging material swap contracts and forward currency exchange contracts to hedge specific purchase commitments 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding twelve months and are settled at maturity  based on prices agreed to at the inception of the contracts

gains and losses deferred in these instruments at june   were million and million  respectively 
as a matter of policy  the company does not engage in speculative activity and does not hedge to protect the translated results of foreign operations or other economic exposures for which speculative accounting treatment of the hedging instrument would be required 
the information below presents the company s rough rice futures positions outstanding as of june  all other derivative financial instruments are not material as of june  expected maturity fiscal futures contracts long positions contract volumes cwt  weighted average contract price per cwt contract amount  weighted average fair value per cwt fair value  impact of the year issue the company is currently working to resolve the potential impact of the year on the processing of date sensitive data by the company s computerized information systems 
the year is critical to these systems as many computer programs are written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year 
as a result  any of the company s computer applications that have date sensitive programs may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculation causing disruptions including but not limited to a temporary inability to process transactions  issue invoices  communicate with customers and financial institutions and update internal accounting systems 
if not corrected  such disruptions could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company has initiated a company wide program to prepare the company s computer systems and applications for the year based on present information  the company believes that it will be able to achieve year compliance through modification of some existing programs and the replacement of other programs with new programs that are already year compliant 
the company will utilize both internal and external resources to reprogram  or replace  and test software for year compliance 
the company plans to complete the year conversion project by september  the total project costs are presently estimated not to exceed million and will be expensed as incurred  unless new software is purchased in which case costs will be capitalized 
the company is taking steps to resolve year compliance issues that may be created by customers  suppliers and financial institutions with whom the company does business 
however  there can be no guarantee that the systems of other entities will be converted timely 
a failure to convert by another entity could have a significant adverse effect on the company 
the costs of the year conversion project and the date on which the company plans to complete the project are based on management s best estimates  which were derived using numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modification plans and other factors 
there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could vary significantly from current estimates 
the company does not have a written contingency plan to address the issues that could arise should the company or any of its suppliers or customers not be prepared to accommodate year issues timely 
the company believes that in an emergency it could revert to the use of manual systems that do not rely on computers and could perform the minimum functions required to maintain the flow of goods and provide information reporting to maintain satisfactory control of the business 
should the company have to utilize manual systems  it is uncertain that it could maintain the same level of operations and this could have a material adverse impact on the business 
the company intends to maintain constant surveillance on this situation and will develop such contingency plans as are required by the changing environment 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this form k include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities act of  as amended 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  the company can give no assurance that these expectations will be achieved
