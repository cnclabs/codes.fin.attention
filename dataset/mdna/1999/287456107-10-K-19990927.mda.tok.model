 the company is segregated into two segments roofing products and industrial products 
the roofing products group consists of the various operating subsidiaries of elk corporation of dallas collectively elk 
these companies manufacture and sell premium laminated fiberglass asphalt residential and accessory roofing products  together with nonwoven mats used in manufacturing asphalt roofing products and various industrial applications 
elk accounted for of consolidated sales in fiscal the industrial products group is comprised of three diverse businesses conductive coatings used in digital wireless cellular phones and in other electronic equipment  remanufactured reciprocating engine components used in the railroad and marine transportation industries  and technology licensing and consulting services for the natural gas processing industry 
none of the three industrial products businesses individually accounted for of consolidated sales  operating income or assets in fiscal historically  the first two businesses in the industrial products group were operated as separate divisions of chromium corporation 
effective july   chromium s operations were segregated into separate companies 
reciprocating engine components will continue to do business as chromium corporation and conductive coatings will be operated as subsidiaries of cybershield  inc the technology licensing and consulting services business will continue to be conducted as ortloff engineers  ltd 
fiscal compared to fiscal during the fiscal year ended june   income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased to  from  in fiscal sales increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increases in sales and income before the accounting change were primarily the result of increased production  a record level of shipments of premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles  and accelerating demand for the company s compushield r products used in digital wireless cellular phones 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  issued by the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants  which resulted in a  charge  net of tax  for the cumulative effect of this accounting change 
this one time cumulative charge reduced net income for fiscal to  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
sales for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal each of the company s three roofing plants recorded increased sales as a result of strong demand in most regions of the united states 
elk s shipments were aided by relatively mild weather during the winter months which permitted increased roofing activity in elk s seasonally slower period together with sharply higher demand throughout the fiscal year in the residential roofing replacement market 
average selling prices were slightly higher in fiscal compared to fiscal and customer discounts were lower 
operating income for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal each of the three roofing plants achieved significantly higher operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of increased manufacturing output and a record level of shipments of premium laminated fiberglass asphalt shingles 
elk s nonwoven fiberglass roofing mat plant also contributed to improved results for the roofing products group 
however  a dryer on one production line was damaged by an explosion on september  and the damaged line was shut down or ran at curtailed line speeds for much of fiscal due to the company s property damage and business interruption insurance policies  this explosion did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
as of june  the plant was again running at line speeds equivalent to line speeds at the time of the explosion 
the company currently anticipates continued strong demand for its premium laminated asphalt shingles and mat products in fiscal the company expects certain raw material costs  particularly asphalt and fiberglass  and shipping and warehousing costs to increase in fiscal year however  the company believes that anticipated increases in these costs can be offset by price increases on its products  improved manufacturing efficiencies  better raw material usage  and freight and warehousing strategies to maximize shipments 
sales for the industrial products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal operating income for this group decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to benefit from strong demand for compushield r conductive coatings and formed in place dispense gaskets used in digital wireless cellular phones and other electronic products 
improved sales and operating results for conductive coatings  however  were offset by lower sales and reduced income at chromium s reciprocating engine components division and at ortloff engineers 
the reciprocating engine components division experienced lower demand for remanufactured large diesel engine components used in the railroad and marine transportation industries  due primarily to further consolidation of the railroad industry and a reduction in maintenance requirements by some of its customers 
chromium is consolidating its operations to its cleveland  ohio facility 
estimated costs to relocate equipment and other consolidation items of  are expected to be incurred and expensed in the first half of fiscal severance costs of  relating to terminating employees at its lufkin  texas facility were recorded in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  chromium also recorded a  pretax charge to settle some long standing third party tort litigation 
ortloff s patent licensing and engineering consulting services to the petroleum industry were significantly lower in fiscal as a result of depressed oil prices during much of the fiscal year  causing many of its customers to temporarily reduce capital spending plans 
prospects for fiscal are improved due to a recovery of oil prices in the latter half of fiscal on january   a subsidiary of the company acquired ydk america  inc renamed cybershield of georgia  inc 
in june 
operations of this acquired company were included in fiscal operations subsequent to its acquisition  but were not material 
overall selling  general and administrative sg a costs in fiscal increased from fiscal  primarily as a result of increased business activity 
as a percentage of sales  sg a costs in fiscal declined to of sales from in fiscal interest expense in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal  the company capitalized  in interest costs in connection with the construction of major projects  compared to  capitalized in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal during the fiscal year ended june   sales increased to  from the  reported in fiscal net income in fiscal increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
both the roofing products and industrial products groups generated significant increases in sales 
the roofing products group reported better operating results in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  the substantial increase in net income was primarily attributable to increased demand and dramatically improved operating results in each of the industrial products group s principal operations 
sales for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal the western united states produced very strong demand for elk prestique premium laminated shingles 
however  shipments on the west coast were limited during much of the second half of fiscal by el nino s impact  as many roofing contractors could not replace leaking roofs during extended periods of heavy rainfall 
demand was also higher in the southeast  midwest and north regions 
only in the southwestern region was demand lower than in the previous fiscal year 
average selling prices were about the same in fiscal compared to fiscal elk s roofing mat operations achieved significantly higher sales and operating profit  primarily as a result of growing demand for its high quality roofing mats and specialty industrial products 
operating income for the roofing products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal each of elk s three roofing plants and its roofing mat operation were very profitable in fiscal  although the ennis  texas roofing plant s operating results were lower in fiscal as a result of lower demand in the southwestern region 
the impact of high winds and heavy rainfall in much of the nation during the winter months increased the level of demand during the latter months of fiscal sales for the industrial products group increased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal operating income for this group increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal each of the three principal operations in this business segment reported significantly higher sales and operating income in fiscal cybershield continued to benefit from strong demand for its compushield conductive coatings and dispense conductive gasketing used in digital wireless cellular phones and in other electronic equipment 
chromium also experienced higher sales and significantly improved margins in plating certain proprietary finishes for large diesel engine components during fiscal further  ortloff engineers revenues from its technology licensing and consulting services for the natural gas processing industry about doubled in fiscal as compared to fiscal this resulted in a tripling of operating income for this business activity in fiscal sg a costs in fiscal increased from fiscal primarily as a result of increased business activity 
as a percentage of sales  sg a costs declined to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal interest expense in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal in fiscal   of interest was capitalized in connection with the company s major facilities expansion program 
in fiscal  the company capitalized  in interest costs in connection with its existing plant expansion program 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated cash flows from operating activities of  in fiscal  despite a  increase in working capital 
the increase in working capital was primarily the result of higher trade receivables and a receivable from an insurance company relating to an explosion at the company s nonwoven fiberglass roofing mat plant 
trade receivables increased primarily as a result of higher sales activities  especially during the last two months of fiscal the period to which most outstanding trade receivables apply  when the company achieved a year to year increase 
at june   deferred payment term receivables from promotional programs to certain customers were  compared to  at june  deferred receivables outstanding at june   are primarily due during the first four months of fiscal the increase in receivables was partially offset by lower inventories and higher current liabilities 
the current ratio was to at june  and to at june  historically  working capital requirements and associated borrowings fluctuate during the year because of seasonality in some market areas 
generally  working capital requirements and borrowings are higher in the spring and summer  and lower in the fall and winter 
the company used  for net investing activities in fiscal the majority of investing expenditures were for additions to property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures totaling approximately  in fiscal relate to replacement of equipment at the ennis  texas mat plant damaged by an explosion 
most of the expenditures incurred to replace damaged equipment are expected to be covered by the company s property damage insurance policy 
the majority of other fiscal capital expenditures are a continuation of productivity  capacity and cost improvement projects at its existing roofing and conductive coatings facilities  capital costs associated with developing new computer systems and expenditures relating to a fourth major laminated shingle plant 
in january a subsidiary of the company acquired ydk america  inc for approximately  to expand capacity for its conductive coatings business 
the company expects to invest about  over a three year period beginning in fiscal to expand capacity and improve productivity at existing plants  to install production facilities for new products  to build a new roofing plant  and to increase capacity for cybershield s conductive coatings business 
cash flows provided by financing activities were  during fiscal  primarily resulting from a  increase in long term debt  offset by dividend payments and purchases of treasury shares 
long term debt represented of the  of invested capital long term debt plus shareholders equity at june  at june    was available under the company s  unsecured revolving line of credit 
during fiscal  the company purchased  shares of its common shares on the open market under sec rule b at a total cost of  and completed the  stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in september on september   the board of directors authorized an additional  stock repurchase program 
in june  the board of directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend to five cents per common share after giving effect to a stock split and declared a three for two stock split payable in the form of a stock dividend distributed on august  to shareholders of record on july  the company is planning to increase its unsecured revolving credit facility from  to  in fiscal to support its capital expansion program 
management believes that current cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and its unsecured revolving credit facility should be sufficient during fiscal and beyond to fund its planned capital expenditures  working capital needs  dividends  stock repurchases and other cash requirements

the company adopted sfas no 
in fiscal the adoption of sfas no

the company has no significant pension or post retirement benefit plans affected by this statement 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

year issue the company is currently developing a new information system for most of its critical financial  distribution and manufacturing applications 
the system is scheduled for completion and implementation before december  at an estimated total cost of about  while the primary purpose of this new information system is to modernize and improve the company s operations  it is also expected to resolve the year issues in these critical computer systems 
costs to develop this new information system are being capitalized 
other costs relating to year readiness are being expensed as incurred 
as of june   the company s expenditures for its new information system have been  and its expenditures for its year readiness projects have been less than  at this time  other than the cost of developing and implementing its new information system  the company does not believe that the costs of addressing the year issue will be material 
the company does not believe that other critical information systems work has been deferred due to its year efforts 
using teams of employees and consultants  the company has completed its review and testing of other computer applications and systems not included in the scope of the new information system  including embedded technology  for year readiness 
the company expects to have completed any required remediation before january  the company has developed contingency plans for its critical information system which primarily consist of making its existing information system year compliant in the event the new system is not completed by its scheduled date 
the company has completed and tested its remedial programming for its existing computer system and believes this system to be year compliant 
the company has made inquiries of key suppliers and other third parties with whom it has significant business relationships to assess their state of readiness in addressing year issues that could adversely impact the company 
the company has requested a written response from those third parties that they will be year compliant by the end of calendar the company has no means of ensuring that its business partners will be fully year compliant 
contingency plans for what the company determines to be the most reasonably and likely worst case scenario are being developed 
disruptions of financial markets or computer system failure at government agencies  financial institutions  utilities and others on which the company is dependent could adversely affect the company 
the effects of a potential disruption at these entities cannot be determined at this time 
the company believes the year readiness project is on schedule for timely completion 
based on a current assessment of risks relating to its year readiness  the company does not believe that this issue will result in uncertainty that is reasonably likely to materially affect future financial results or operating performance 
forward looking statements in an effort to give investors a well rounded view of the company s current condition and future opportunities  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition and other sections of this form k contain forward looking statements about its prospects for the future 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the following the company s roofing products business is substantially non cyclical  but can be affected by weather and the availability of financing and general economic conditions 
in addition  the asphalt roofing products manufacturing business is highly competitive 
actions of competitors  including changes in pricing  or slowing demand for asphalt roofing products due to general or industry economic conditions or the amount of inclement weather could result in decreased demand for the company s products  lower prices received or reduced utilization of plant facilities 
further  changes in building codes and other standards from time to time can cause changes in demand  or increases in costs that may not be passed through to customers 
in the asphalt roofing products business  the significant raw materials are ceramic coated granules  asphalt  glass fibers  resins and mineral filler 
increased costs of raw materials can result in reduced margins  as can higher trucking and rail costs 
historically  the company has been able to pass some of the higher raw material and transportation costs through to the customer 
should the company be unable to recover higher raw material and or transportation costs from price increases of its products  operating results could be lower than projected 
during fiscal  the company completed the construction of a plant at the company s ennis  texas facility to manufacture nonwoven fiberglass roofing mats and other mats for a variety of industrial uses 
the company also expects to make about million in new investments to expand capacity and improve productivity at existing plants and to build new plants over a three year period beginning in fiscal progress in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies and financial results is difficult to predict for new plant facilities 
if such progress is slower than anticipated  if substantial cost overruns occur in building new plants  or if demand for products produced at new plants does not meet current expectations  operating results could be adversely affected 
certain facilities of the company s industrial products subsidiaries must utilize hazardous materials in their production process 
as a result  the company could incur costs for remediation activities at its facilities or off site  and other related exposures from time to time in excess of established reserves for such activities 
the company s litigation  including its patent infringement suits against gaf building materials corporation and certain affiliates  is subject to inherent and case specific uncertainty 
the outcome of such litigation depends on numerous interrelated factors  many of which cannot be predicted 
even with fully developed action and contingency plans for year readiness  it is possible that the company will not achieve full internal readiness 
further  the company s business may be adversely affected by external year disruption that the company is not in position to control  including but not limited to potential disruptions in power and other energy supplies  telecommunications or other infrastructure  potential disruptions in transportation and the supply of raw materials  and potential disruptions in financial and banking systems 
year problems therefore could result in unanticipated expenses or liabilities  production or disruption delays or other adverse effects on the company 
although the company currently anticipates that most of its needs for new capital in the near future will be met with internally generated funds and borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facilities  significant increases in interest rates could substantially affect its borrowing costs under its existing loan facility  or its cost of alternative sources of capital 
each of the company s businesses  especially cybershield s conductive coatings business  is subject to the risks of technological changes that could affect the demand for or the relative cost of the company s products and services  or the method and profitability of the method of distribution or delivery of such products and services 
in addition  the company s businesses each could suffer significant setbacks in revenues and operating income if it lost one or more of its largest customers 
although the company insures itself against physical loss to its manufacturing facilities  including business interruption losses  natural or other disasters and accidents  including but not limited to fire  earthquake  damaging winds and explosions  operating results could be adversely affected if any of its manufacturing facilities became inoperable for an extended period of time due to such events 
each of the company s businesses is actively involved in the development of new products  processes and services which are expected to contribute to the company s long term growth and earnings 
if such development activities are not successful  or the company cannot provide the requisite financial and other resources to successfully commercialize such developments  the growth of future sales and earnings may be adversely affected 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking beliefs or judgments in making investment decisions
