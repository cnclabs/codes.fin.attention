some of the company s computer programs that have date sensitive software may recognize a date using as the year rather than the year this could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations  including  among other things  a temporary inability to process transactions  send invoices  ship product or engage in any number of similar business activities 
based on its assessment of the year issue  the company determined that it would need to modify or replace portions of its software so that its computer systems will properly utilize dates beyond december  the company presently believes that with modifications to existing software and conversions to new software  the year issue can be mitigated 
however  if such modifications and conversions are not made or completed timely  the year issue could have a material impact on the operations of the company 
the company has identified significant suppliers and service providers to determine the extent to which the company is vulnerable to those third parties failure to remediate their own year issue 
this program is ongoing and the company will continue to evaluate responses received to determine if year issues exist with these third parties 
it is expected that full identification will be completed by june  to the extent that responses to year readiness are unsatisfactory  contingency plans include finding alternative suppliers where practical 
for those suppliers that are not easily replaced  the company will maintain adequate supplies to help counteract short term supply interruptions 
the company has received indications that most of its customers are working on year compliance 
in the event that any of the company s significant customers or suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve year compliance  and the company is unable to replace them with new customers or alternative suppliers  the company s business or operations could be adversely affected 
the company has initiated the implementation of an enterprise wide resource planning erp software system to link all of its core business systems throughout the company 
this implementation was the result of normal business migration to improved and expanded software systems to increase the company s ability to improve its operational efficiency  reduce costs and enhance overall quality 
as part of this implementation  the company will also replace those business systems that will encounter the year issue

the company is currently evaluating data gathered with regard to non financial software and imbedded chip technology to asses the impact of the year on its non financial systems such as manufacturing equipment  security equipment  etc 
scheduled completion of the data gathering and evaluation of the year impact is june  the company does not  at this time  have sufficient data to estimate the cost of achieving year compliance for its non financial systems  however  based on information received to date  the costs are not expected to be material 
since the company is in the information gathering stage  the company expects to have a contingency plan in place for its internal non financial software and imbedded chip technology by july  the costs of the project and the date on which the company plans to complete the year modifications are based on management s best estimates which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources  third party modifications  plans and other factors 
however  there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those plans 
specific factors that might cause such material differences include  but are not limited to  the availability and cost of personnel trained in this area  the ability to locate and correct all relevant computer codes and similar uncertainties
